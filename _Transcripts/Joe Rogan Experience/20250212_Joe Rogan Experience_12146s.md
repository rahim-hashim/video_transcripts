# Joe Rogan Experience #2272 - Mike Benz
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5.82s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=9.6s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11.6s)]
*  I've been looking forward to this one. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=13.6s)]
*  Me too. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=15.6s)]
*  All night I was like, ooh, tomorrow's going to be a good one. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=17.6s)]
*  For you, it must have been very exciting to have the vault opened and to get a peek into [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=20.6s)]
*  the machine because you've been describing this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=27.48s)]
*  The last time you were on the podcast, you went into depth about USAID. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=29.68s)]
*  And it's very curious why they chose USAID as the first organization for DOJ to investigate [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=34.16s)]
*  because it seems like they were the ones that resisted the most. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=39.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=43.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=44.04s)]
*  Well, you know, the joke that I tell here is it's like what they tell you to do your [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=45.04s)]
*  first day of prison is you go in, you walk up to the meanest, baddest SOB and you punch [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=47.44s)]
*  them right in the mouth. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=52.68s)]
*  I mean, that's basically what's happened here with the White House's first target being [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=53.68s)]
*  USAID. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  USAID opens up the entire world of the blob of the foreign policy establishment and its [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=58.88s)]
*  weaponization of what are supposed to be foreign facing Department of Dirty Tricks operations [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=65.12s)]
*  against domestic opponents. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=70.48s)]
*  And when it all got opened and you started to see the numbers and the different organizations [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  and NGOs that were getting them, was anything surprising to you or was this all what you [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=79.64s)]
*  expected? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=82.92s)]
*  No. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=83.92s)]
*  I think we're at the tip of the iceberg and what people are going to see on this is going [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  to completely reorient their mental map of how they think the world works, how they think [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=90.28s)]
*  American power projects into the institutions. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=95.8s)]
*  And I think the calls for reform are going to get louder and louder as people realize [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=100.12s)]
*  the reality that's been constructed around them is downstream of something that was started [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=105.0s)]
*  very long ago when American statecraft to manage the American empire for the benefit [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=112.72s)]
*  of the American people began to warp and distort every institution in American life from the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=118.84s)]
*  media to now the social media companies to the unions to the universities and academics [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=125.36s)]
*  to the NGOs and think tanks to the prosecutors to our conception of terrorism to our conception [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=132.32s)]
*  of activity in the drug trade to our everything. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=140.2s)]
*  What we're really doing with public health programs and the medical establishment and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  what drives that all the way into poverty relief and you name it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=153.48s)]
*  Every institution is instrumentalized by this apparatus supposedly to help us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=159.6s)]
*  But really starting this has been done in US history before this happened against the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=164.48s)]
*  left against the Democrats in the 1960s and 70s when the CIA and to an extent its sister [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=168.88s)]
*  orgs like USAID and whatnot were pumping money into domestic politics to stop the anti-Vietnam [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=176.44s)]
*  war movement. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=182.18s)]
*  And this led to the reforms of the late 1970s, the Church Committee hearing, the Pike Committee [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=183.18s)]
*  hearing, the establishment of a Senate Intelligence Committee and House Intelligence Committee [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=188.44s)]
*  for oversight. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=192.28s)]
*  But even that was a very small glimpse into the window. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=193.28s)]
*  The analogy I give here is like the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, the Chronicles [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=198.28s)]
*  of Narnia where there's this whole cinematic universe. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=202.2s)]
*  You're living in this house and there's this closet in the back of a wardrobe and if you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=206.28s)]
*  never walk through it you never see that whole world. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=212.28s)]
*  You can live your whole life without seeing it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=214.4s)]
*  But when you open that door and you step into it you see there's an entire other universe [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=216.44s)]
*  here that's been right next to you this whole time. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=220.64s)]
*  When you first started working for the State Department, did you have any inclination that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=223.8s)]
*  you were going to get involved in? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  Did you have any inclination that this was going on? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=231.0s)]
*  Did you know already? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=234.12s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=235.12s)]
*  You already knew? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=236.12s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=237.12s)]
*  I had already been working on this for many years. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=238.12s)]
*  When did you first discover it? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  Around August 2016. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  I was deeply passionate about the Internet censorship issue. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=244.12s)]
*  I had some weird experiences playing chess as a kid where I sort of came of age when [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=253.32s)]
*  Gary Kasparov lost to Deep Blue and AI took over, really took the spirit out of a lot [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=258.88s)]
*  of the chess world. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=268.16s)]
*  And it was apparent to me as a kid that these AI chess engines were going to outcompete [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=269.68s)]
*  humans but when I was young the sort of older people in the room were in denial about it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=275.48s)]
*  And when I saw that same thing in 2016 with the development of AI censorship super weapons, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=281.8s)]
*  I called those weapons of mass deletion, that they would be like weapons of mass destruction [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=289.12s)]
*  but for speech. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=293.26000000000005s)]
*  A few lines of code would allow you to destroy entire political movements, governments, narratives. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=294.34s)]
*  There'd be no escape from it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=302.3s)]
*  We would permanently change the face of political warfare or domestic politics. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=303.3s)]
*  You don't need a standing army of 100,000 censors if you just have one machine learning, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=310.26s)]
*  ingested database of 900 million tweets that you can ingest and then make this sophisticated [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  narrative network map of all the different keywords and concepts you want to censor. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=326.62s)]
*  To me that was like this free speech version or the censorship version of the atom bomb. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=331.7s)]
*  So I started that quest in 2016 but very quickly that research and the process of trying to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=337.94s)]
*  write that showed these international networks immediately. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=346.1s)]
*  I mean the NLP, the natural language processing sort of backbone of this was all being sponsored [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=349.9s)]
*  by DARPA to be able to monitor the speech of ISIS or extremist or terrorist groups. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=356.78000000000003s)]
*  And when I saw that coming home and being advocated here, I spent my whole day, morning, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=363.06s)]
*  noon, night, 20 hours a day basically chronicling, archiving. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=371.58s)]
*  That's how I know so many of these characters is because I feel like I know them better [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=376.02s)]
*  than my own friends and family having spent so many years watching this all develop. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=379.97999999999996s)]
*  What did it feel like being one of the only people that was sounding the alarm for essentially [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=386.5s)]
*  eight years? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=391.29999999999995s)]
*  Like you get involved in 2016 and no one even, the general public until you came on this [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=392.29999999999995s)]
*  podcast I don't even think we're aware that this was an issue at all. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=398.74s)]
*  But even then things got lost so quickly in the cycle of news, things just come and go [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=402.5s)]
*  so quickly until Doge started unraveling all the spending. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  And you start seeing things like $200 million allocated to transgender experiments on monkeys. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=413.18s)]
*  Like what the fuck? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=421.17999999999995s)]
*  Like this is crazy. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=423.74s)]
*  And that's just a tip of the iceberg. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=425.46s)]
*  And then the NGOs and then that map of 50,000 NGOs that was essentially just democratic [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=428.3s)]
*  propaganda machine that was exposed. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=435.98s)]
*  It was all just money being funneled in a circular manner. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=439.82000000000005s)]

*  Totally. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=482.74s)]
*  I mean, it's been exhilarating. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=483.74s)]
*  There is a sort of, I understand the weight of history here. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=488.22s)]
*  We are doing open heart surgery on the body of the American empire, our influence abroad. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=492.22s)]
*  And it has to be done well. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=499.22s)]
*  And so I want to help the American homeland. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=501.62s)]
*  And so this is a sensitive process. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=505.3s)]
*  You know, obviously it's been a bit surreal seeing the past couple weeks where people are now, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=507.70000000000005s)]
*  I go to my ex timeline and I see everyone doing the same exercise that I gave up everything to be doing eight years ago. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=515.02s)]
*  Going into, you know, because all this stuff is open source. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=522.86s)]
*  You didn't need to be an inside guy to see this. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=525.5400000000001s)]
*  If you knew where to look, these are usaspending.gov. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=528.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, I used to joke is the main difference between or was I think until Freedom opened up when Elon acquired X [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=533.22s)]
*  and a few institutional changes began to happen in the government and with Congress. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=539.22s)]
*  But I used to joke that usaspending.gov was the main difference during the height of this censorship, you know, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=545.9s)]
*  total control era was the main difference between us and Russia and China, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=553.06s)]
*  which was that we have this sort of autocratic control over information and institutions by the US government. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=556.5s)]
*  So do they. The difference is, is we can go to usaspending.gov and look up how they do it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=563.86s)]
*  And so when I when I've been going to my ex timeline and seeing everybody independently doing that exercise [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=569.62s)]
*  and finding the joy in that, the self discovery process and being able to share it with people and everybody being able to understand [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=576.54s)]
*  and make sense of the receipts because, you know, this framework for understanding it has been has been shared and popularized. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=583.86s)]
*  That, to me, as has been the goal all along to be able to give people the language and the frameworks to understand [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=592.94s)]
*  what is so terrifying and necessary to reform. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=601.1s)]
*  But that's right there, you know, in front of your eyes. If you only open your eyes to see it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=606.2600000000001s)]
*  It's got to be exciting, though, for you to be there on Operation Day when they are doing the open heart surgery. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=612.62s)]
*  It is it is, you know, we need to make sure that the patient doesn't die, you know, on the, you know, on the operating table. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=618.26s)]
*  Just because it's the right move to do the open heart surgery because the patient needs it doesn't mean that the operation goes well. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=626.82s)]
*  If, you know, if the operating surgeons don't know the anatomy of the organ they're operating on. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=633.46s)]
*  And so that I see right now is sort of my prime function is to just teach more and more of the anatomy of the organ [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=638.6999999999999s)]
*  so that the people who are operating on the patient, the American homeland and generally speaking, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=644.6999999999999s)]
*  the American influence and power projection into foreign countries comes out better, smarter, a little bit more honest. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=652.9s)]
*  And there is a hard domestic firewall against our foreign facing dirty tricks, criminal penalties against against agencies who who go against this civil penalties [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=662.26s)]
*  so that you can sue both the agencies and the NGOs who are sponsored maybe with treble damages in a bill from Congress so that if USAID in whatever form it continues to take, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=674.8199999999999s)]
*  whether that's at the State Department or whether it gets rolled back out into another independent agency that you could sue the agencies as an individual. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=685.9s)]
*  If you've been if they've broken that domestic firewall so that there's an incentive at the agency on their own budget to tightly oversee these things. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=693.5s)]
*  There's so much that can be done to to bring this in line in a smarter and more moral and frankly more effective way. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=702.66s)]
*  And that's that's the task right now. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=712.38s)]
*  I think one of the most offensive things to Americans is that all this was being done and all this money was being spent while they were denying money to people that clearly needed it, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=714.0999999999999s)]
*  like particularly victims of natural disasters like Maui. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=727.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=731.42s)]
*  The fact that they're spending all this money on those things and yet they gave those people a one time check of seven hundred and seventy dollars or something along those lines. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=732.8199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=742.3s)]
*  Well, this gets to the fundamental heart of the breach of the social contract. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=742.98s)]
*  This thing was was always set up to do. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=747.34s)]
*  You know, it was it was really set up in 1948 when George Kennan created this NSC 10-2, this national national security council. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=749.78s)]
*  We completely reoriented the structure of the American empire in 1948 after World War Two. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=760.02s)]
*  In 1947, we passed something called the National Security Act. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=765.82s)]
*  That's what established the CIA. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=768.46s)]
*  That's what established the National Security Council, which coordinates all of our foreign foreign facing empire management work. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=770.3s)]
*  It renamed the Department of War to the Department of Defense so that it didn't look like we were acquiring territory by military force, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=778.38s)]
*  which had just been banned under international law under the UN Declaration of Human Rights. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=785.26s)]
*  And so we moved from primarily kinetic warfare into what George Kennan called just two months before he created the national plausible deniability doctrine that we live under. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=789.38s)]
*  He called this organized political warfare. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=799.82s)]
*  And and he has a great memo from April 30th, 1948. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=802.0600000000001s)]
*  It's just 12 days after the CIA's first operation, first first time it ever overthrew or rigged the election of a foreign government. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=806.4200000000001s)]
*  This was the April 1948 election in Italy that pitted a pro-Western pro-Western candidate against a sort of pro-Soviet candidate. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=814.38s)]
*  And so the US State Department felt it was essential to tip the scales of that election because it showed that the pro-Soviet candidate was winning 60 to 40. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=823.82s)]
*  This is all declassified and all the major people who are involved in that operation of all come out and said this publicly. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=832.7s)]
*  But so, you know, the CIA basically we threw together this ramshackle effort to tilt that election by pumping in propaganda, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=839.34s)]
*  by using charities and churches as fronts to funnel money into the the pro-Western political party. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=847.86s)]
*  You know, we piped in, you know, the Greg Garbo movies and whatnot. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=855.98s)]
*  We worked with some very unseedy, very seedy elements of Italian society there. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=858.82s)]
*  We worked with the mafia and we worked with mafia connected unions because these were all assets for the war department during World War Two because Mussolini was cracking down on them. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=863.7800000000001s)]
*  So the war department had a relationship with these organized criminal networks to serve as a beachhead against Mussolini. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=874.38s)]
*  But we kept those relationships in order to run this pro-democracy regime change thing. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=881.14s)]
*  So in 1948, when we established the secrecy doctrine doctrine that we now live under, all these NGOs work under this cover effectively because of their sponsoring organizations, USAID or CIA or state. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=886.34s)]
*  And he called it the inauguration of organized political warfare. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=898.86s)]
*  And what he said is we need to create a covert apparatus to hide what we do from the from the rest of the world to do secret political warfare on the low. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=901.2199999999999s)]
*  And the problem is, is the American people are not going to like this. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=910.5s)]
*  The American people do not understand the intricacies of international relations. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=913.6999999999999s)]
*  They think there's always an easy political cure all. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=918.02s)]
*  And they do not understand that they think there's a fundamental difference between peace and war. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=920.66s)]
*  And what he proposed is and this is just two months before this before this would formally be given to the CIA to do. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=925.5s)]
*  But at the time, what he said was this was this work gangbusters in Italy. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=932.6600000000001s)]
*  We need to replicate this everywhere. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=938.3000000000001s)]
*  We need to create a capacity to do black propaganda, to do economic sabotage demolition. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=940.82s)]
*  There's a whole list of what's authorized under NSC 10-2. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=947.7s)]
*  And and what he says is the the American people are not necessarily like this. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=950.6600000000001s)]
*  And we're going to need to effectively hide what we do from them because if they find out, then the rest of the world finds out. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=953.66s)]
*  If we're trying to run an operation in Eurasia and we report this in U.S. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=959.22s)]
*  News, well, then any person in Eurasia who reads U.S. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=964.1s)]
*  News now knows about it. And so that was authorized at the time with simultaneous with the Smith-Munt Act, which I'm not. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=966.62s)]
*  Are you familiar with the Smith-Munt Act? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=974.74s)]
*  Is that the 2011 2012 thing where Obama allowed people to use propaganda against United States citizens? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=976.38s)]
*  Yeah, that was what was done then under Obama was the was the effective repeal of it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=983.3s)]
*  It was called the Smith-Munt Modernization Act. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=989.18s)]
*  But the modernization got rid of the whole purpose of it, the fire, the firewall, because at the time, the media and media control was seen as the linchpin crux of winning the Cold War, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=992.2199999999999s)]
*  piping in pro-U.S. media influence to so that because everything moved after World War Two from kinetic warfare and military occupation. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1006.02s)]
*  And we used to militarily occupy the Philippines, for example, after we won the Spanish-American War. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1016.5799999999999s)]
*  But that was that was banned under international law, territorial acquisition by military force in 1948. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1021.14s)]
*  So we had to win elections and and we had to influence the passage of laws in foreign countries by having an apparatus inside those countries that influence the hearts and minds of people, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1027.02s)]
*  which influenced who they voted for, which then determined the government. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1039.54s)]
*  So you had to move towards political vassalage rather than military occupation. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1043.2199999999998s)]
*  And what the Smith-Munt Act did is simultaneous with the creation of this in 1948. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1047.74s)]
*  Congress recognized the Frankenstein monster they were creating by authorizing a covert permanent Department of Dirty Tricks. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1052.22s)]
*  And this is their phrase, not mine. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1060.66s)]
*  To do this cloak and dagger to to to infiltrate and co-opt the universities, the unions, the media, the politicians, the judges, the whole swarm army. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1063.14s)]
*  You know what I have been calling for a long time, the USA Truman Show, because these people in these foreign countries have no idea, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1073.78s)]
*  how many how many things they interact with that are effectively a movie set being constructed by the US State Department and its sister influence orgs. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1081.7s)]
*  But the point I'm getting at here is the Smith-Munt Act in 1948 said, OK, you guys can do this. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1090.9s)]
*  State Department can do this. CIA can do this. USAID, when it came along 13 years later, could do this. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1097.0200000000002s)]
*  But we. So there was a guy named Frank Wisner who is known as one of the godfather figures of the CIA. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1102.94s)]
*  He's known for creating what was called the Wisner's Warlitzer, which was a it's like a church organ and that he would brag that he could play the international media like a symphony to make any media narrative go viral in any country on Earth because of the suite of CIA proprietary media functions and its distribution network, especially when the US had first moved for advantage in radio and print. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1111.02s)]
*  It's basically the US and UK, the only games in town really, and having robust radio, film, TV and print media. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1133.8999999999999s)]
*  So the Smith-Munt was said, OK, you can do that abroad. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1141.9799999999998s)]
*  You can plant fake news stories in France. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1146.9399999999998s)]
*  You can you can have propaganda blare into Africa or Western Europe or Central Asia, but that can't come home. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1149.9399999999998s)]
*  You can't sign up our own people with your propaganda organ abroad because the point of authorizing this is that we get cheaper gas. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1160.02s)]
*  We get import export markets. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1168.3s)]
*  You know, we get a high standard of living because if a foreign government doesn't want to give up its resources or allow a US military base or allow joint partnerships or exports of goods or US multinational corporations operate there, then the American people suffer economically. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1170.3s)]
*  So it was always designed to say, listen, you can do this dirty stuff abroad, but it can't come home. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1189.3s)]
*  We have and even that protection, which which lasted for 70 years and only we only lost it a decade ago. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1195.54s)]
*  We're up against a much actually deeper, darker problem with this USAID scandal. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1206.26s)]
*  And as people will see increasingly, the scandals that will break open at the Pentagon and the State Department, which is that we have a Smith-Munt problem for [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1211.3799999999999s)]
*  funding and operations. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1219.22s)]
*  It's not just propaganda. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1220.66s)]
*  The blob, our foreign policy establishment, can fund groups that effectively work with prosecutors domestically or that or that work at media, you know, dual sort of dual use. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1222.5s)]
*  We give them foreign grants to do media propaganda abroad, but they operate here or social media censorship to coerce foreign countries to pass foreign censorship laws that explicitly and are intended to attack US social [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1236.5s)]
*  media companies and in US peer to peer speech. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1249.22s)]
*  So we need that protection. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1252.26s)]
*  If we're going to keep this function at all, we need a hard firewall and absolute grotesque penalties for any violation. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1255.1000000000001s)]
*  So when you're watching all this unfold, one of the things that I've been seeing is that there's been legal action to try to halt some of it. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1263.78s)]
*  They've been told to destroy any information that they got from certain databases. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1275.5400000000002s)]
*  Like, what's what's your take on this and whether any of that is going to hold up? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1280.66s)]
*  Oh, 100 percent. Well, 100. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1285.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to hold up. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1287.0600000000002s)]
*  I think it's going to be a legal dogfight. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1288.22s)]
*  This is, you know, it's funny because it's sort of a circular dragon eating its own tail because you're going after the primary soft power projection organ of the blob because it's been weaponized [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1290.66s)]
*  against Americans. But what is the blob authorized to do? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1304.58s)]
*  What is USAID authorized to do under statute? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1307.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, something they call judicial reform, which is USAID poaching funding financially the networks around judges, around around courts, around the legal system, around the governance [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1310.06s)]
*  structure of every country on planet Earth. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1324.78s)]
*  I mean, and Jamie, if you want to just go through a fun exercise right now, you can put on screen just a simple Google search so people can see just how [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1327.6599999999999s)]
*  open source this is. And I can walk through specific damning examples of this. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1334.46s)]
*  But if you just type in on Google the word USAID and then in a Boolean quotes judicial reform. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1338.6200000000001s)]
*  And what you're going to see are. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1348.9s)]
*  You know, basically a hundred countries that USAID is going after the judges, going after the legal system in order to rig the scales of justice in favor of [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1351.94s)]
*  the foreign policy establishment's interest there. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1364.8600000000001s)]
*  And this has this has fully come home. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1367.42s)]
*  And I can go through some examples of this. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1369.78s)]
*  For example, there's there's a group a group called the OCCRP, which you can think of as the corruption reporting project. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1371.66s)]
*  The this is a group that half of its funding comes from USAID and the U.S. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1381.46s)]
*  State Department. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1387.8600000000001s)]
*  The USAID and the State Department have a veto right over the staff that it can hire. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1388.9s)]
*  This is the largest consortium of investigative journalists on planet Earth. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1392.8600000000001s)]
*  This is this is the group that broke the Panama Papers. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1396.74s)]
*  You know, they got all these hacked documents. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1399.3400000000001s)]
*  They got special access to it. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1401.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't have any facts on this. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1404.22s)]
*  I'm simply noting that it's an oddity that a group funded by a major CIA funding conduit, USAID, has been a major funding conduit. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1406.18s)]
*  USAID, while the CIA has the ability to hack any target around the world that's authorized by the National Security Council. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1418.18s)]
*  You know, there's the getting these special access documents that are reportedly either hacked or leaked. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1426.94s)]
*  And they're being sponsored by, you know, the group that's connected to something with hacking power. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1432.74s)]
*  But I don't know that for a fact. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1438.22s)]
*  I'm simply noting that for investigative purposes, for oversight bodies who may want to ask questions. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1439.7s)]
*  But they so they they've won hundreds of awards. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1446.3799999999999s)]
*  They've their their name has been so pristine for so long. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1451.1399999999999s)]
*  They've been around for almost 20 years and they were sponsored in order to do they do investigative hit piece journalism about corruption. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1454.8999999999999s)]
*  And what they do is they go after all of the State Department and USAID and DOD's opponents in the region. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1462.82s)]
*  So, for example, Jamie, I text you this beforehand, but if the first thing you want to put on screen are the first two images that I texted you, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1469.3000000000002s)]
*  this is from the USAID dot gov website. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1476.8200000000002s)]
*  And I think this will shock people when they see this on with the USAID dot gov URL right there. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1478.9s)]
*  And so that you can you can see how. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1489.46s)]
*  Yeah. So if you go if you go to the first page that I texted that text to you, then we'll get to this one. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1492.14s)]
*  This is the first thing you said. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1497.0200000000002s)]
*  OK, I'm sorry. The second one. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1497.94s)]
*  Yeah. OK. So here it is. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1500.5800000000002s)]
*  This is USAID's strengthening transparency and accountability through investigative reporting program. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1502.5400000000002s)]
*  OK. What you'll see here is you'll see the life of activity. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1507.8200000000002s)]
*  This fund is they are still being funded through this grant. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1511.8200000000002s)]
*  And this is for Europe and Eurasia. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1515.22s)]
*  And you'll see the countries Eastern Partnership Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Western Balkans. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1517.6200000000001s)]
*  If you scroll down, you'll see USA spending USAID spending USAID funding is 20 million dollars, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1523.46s)]
*  20 million dollars that our taxpayers paid to every. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1530.66s)]
*  Listen, they don't report on kittens being saved from falling out of trees. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1535.7s)]
*  Everything they do is a hit piece about an instance of corruption that can be used by prosecutors in the area to arrest the political opponents of the State Department. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1541.34s)]
*  And what you'll see here is capacity. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1550.06s)]
*  Now, this is the phrase everybody has to know. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1551.6999999999998s)]
*  Capacity building is what this is all built under. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1553.22s)]
*  That means pumping up the blobs assets. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1555.86s)]
*  Whenever you see the word capacity or capacity building, it means this thing is useful to us. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1558.46s)]
*  The more money we give it, the more powerful they are to project our influence. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1563.46s)]
*  And so so if you if you scroll, if you go back to that that page, which is page two of this USAID, you think is we see. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1567.06s)]
*  So for 20 million dollars of of investment from from USAID, here are the and this is live. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1574.82s)]
*  On the website and find this in the way back machine right now because the USAID websites down. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1581.62s)]
*  This is this is USAID, the US government bragging about the achievements of what they achieved by spending 20 million dollars. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1586.1s)]
*  At least four point five billion in fines levied against targets of these hit pieces. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1594.34s)]
*  Now, by the way, I should note that the head of the OCCRP was busted in a major documentary that is very little distribution by encourage everyone to watch where he said, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1600.82s)]
*  because this was this was a this was a I think a year and a half ago or whatnot. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1611.46s)]
*  But it was there up to over 10 billion dollars now. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1615.26s)]
*  What's the documentary? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1617.62s)]
*  It's it's on the WikiLeaks X page right now. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1619.1s)]
*  It's by a group of German journalists who had one on one interviews with the head of this group OCCRP, as well as the USAID grant coordinator and others. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1622.3799999999999s)]
*  And so it's straight from the horse's mouth. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1633.6599999999999s)]
*  And they say he says in that interview, I believe his name is Drew Sullivan, that it's now over 10 billion dollars. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1635.42s)]
*  And he brags that that is a I think he said it was a 20,000 percent return on investment because all these dollars were, quote, returned to government coffers. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1642.74s)]
*  So for 20 million dollars of of mercenary media for the state, state sponsored hit pieces. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1653.22s)]
*  The government's got 10 billion dollars back. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1660.5800000000002s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1663.3s)]
*  That's a that's a 1995 Amazon level return on investment. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1664.74s)]
*  But now let's get into the darker stuff. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1669.78s)]
*  Five hundred and forty eight policy changes by the government or actions by civil society in the private sector. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1672.3s)]
*  Now, we don't know if these policy changes are good or bad. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1679.26s)]
*  Do you think USAID would would list them as accomplishments if they were not in furtherance of USAID's or the state's? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1681.74s)]
*  What they are are saying and in trying to sort of speak through their teeth, as they say it, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1688.78s)]
*  is that they proudly sponsored hit piece journalism to ruin people's lives and go after political targets in order to in order to change the policies of foreign governments from the inside. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1695.94s)]
*  Now goes on to say 21 resignations and sackings. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1710.14s)]
*  Including of a president prime minister. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1714.94s)]
*  Now, the head of OCCRP in this documentary openly says that that their reporting caused I think it was five or six different governments to topple and turn over and be transitioned. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1717.94s)]
*  So this is state sponsored media hit pieces so that prosecutors can arrest presidents and prime ministers to regime change their government and install a more [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1730.1s)]
*  pro US political vassal figure in the region. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1739.5s)]
*  And then the last one is four hundred and fifty six arrests and indictments. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1744.5s)]
*  And this again is listed as a USAID achievement. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1748.26s)]
*  We don't know what these people did. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1751.02s)]
*  We don't know whether they're whether they're guilty or innocent or whether or not these were political prosecutions like you see right now with the New York District Attorney's offices, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1752.66s)]
*  which is a whole nother USAID connected can of worms. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1761.9s)]
*  But these are state sponsored hit pieces for hire in order to get the give the justice departments, the prosecutors in a region, the ammunition to arrest the enemies of the state. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1765.54s)]
*  The prosecutors don't have the capacity to do a whole investigative journalism dig. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1776.94s)]
*  They might not have access to hacked documents that, for example, the CIA, the NSA or deeply connected political insiders might be able to give to a group like OCCRP. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1780.8600000000001s)]
*  Now, this is a very interesting one. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1789.98s)]
*  The NSAID gets a veto right over who they can hire. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1792.06s)]
*  OCCRP has to submit an annual work plan to to to be submitted to and reviewed for approval by the State Department and USAID. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1799.3s)]
*  And and here's the kicker of it all. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1808.94s)]
*  USAID dug up. I'm sorry. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1811.18s)]
*  OCCRP paid for by us, US taxpayers dug up dirt on Rudy Giuliani's work in Ukraine. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1813.74s)]
*  This is because this was part of the twenty nineteen impeachment and, you know, Rudy Giuliani and his work in Ukraine. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1821.58s)]
*  So they went and dug up dirt on Rudy Giuliani, a domestic US citizen, high profile political figure, actually attorney to the US president. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1827.94s)]
*  And then that dirt came home and was used as part of the basis for the twenty nineteen impeachment of the sitting president, Donald Trump. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1837.86s)]
*  That would have never happened unless USAID sponsored that those that hit piecework. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1846.1s)]
*  And then they did the same thing with Paul Manafort, because it's the same foreign policy blob that went after Trump in the first place because of his far his difference in foreign policy vision around Ukraine, Russia and other major. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1852.3799999999999s)]

*  But instead of focusing on the negative all the time, why don't we focus on the positive? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1874.74s)]

*  Now, once you're in a relationship, it's a whole different ballgame and things aren't always going to be perfect. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1894.66s)]

*  The lawfare against Giuliani is interesting. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1948.74s)]
*  Like, what is the case that he lost? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1951.6599999999999s)]
*  It was in Georgia and he was accusing these women who worked at this election facility of something, some improprietary. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1954.74s)]
*  Right. This is a different case than that because that this was related to the 2019 impeachment and all the Ukraine kerfuffle around the quid pro quo call allegedly that President Trump made to President Zelensky, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1965.7s)]
*  which, by the way, we should get to USAID's role in the process in the Joe Biden quid pro quo side of this in a second. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1980.66s)]
*  But that case, I believe, related to two workers in Georgia. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1986.5400000000002s)]
*  And it was related to the whole investigation of election fraud and and whether or not there may have been fraud perpetrated in the in the in the Georgia election. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=1991.5800000000002s)]
*  And I believe it was either twenty twenty one or it may have been. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2003.26s)]
*  I'm sorry. The twenty twenty. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2007.5s)]
*  I'm not that that case I have not. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2009.3s)]
*  I'm not deep in the weeds on. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2011.74s)]
*  But I I have to say this as well. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2013.3400000000001s)]
*  And Jamie, I don't know if the whole audience is familiar with this clip, but it's it's it's an incredible scandalous clip. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2017.18s)]
*  Do you remember when when Joe Biden was at the Council on Foreign Relations and and bragged that he got the top prosecutor in Ukraine? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2023.02s)]
*  Fired by the Ukrainian government because he explicitly conditioned the firing of the prosecutor who was investigating Burisma. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2035.74s)]
*  He expressly conditioned their receipt of a billion dollars in U.S. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2045.82s)]
*  financial assistance on the firing of Victor of Victor Shokin, the prosecutor. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2051.7s)]
*  And he said, well, son of a B, he was fired. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2057.1s)]
*  And it's so crazy watching him brag about that publicly. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2060.42s)]
*  It just shows you what an idiot he is. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2064.3s)]
*  You know what that billion dollars in financial assistance was? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2065.94s)]
*  It was a USAID grant. Yeah, it's the carrots and sticks. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2068.34s)]
*  And it's like that video, Jamie, because it's a shocking video and just the hubris that and the ego that someone has to have to speak of this publicly while it's being filmed, not just publicly, not just in a room, not even just saying it out loud, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2073.9s)]
*  but saying it in front of the council foreign relations backdrop. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2088.78s)]
*  And actually, before you play this, can I make one quick note for the audience that everyone can look up publicly? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2094.18s)]
*  The Council of Foreign Relations. I'm just about to text Jamie and another thing related to this. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2100.02s)]
*  That's that we're going to pull up the USAID grant so that everyone can see this billion dollar USAID grant that he's referring to here and what's in the grant details. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2104.06s)]
*  But when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state running the State Department, that USAID answers to it, right? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2113.1s)]
*  It's USAID is independent, but guided by the state director. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2118.06s)]
*  The State Department function has to advance U.S. interests. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2122.1s)]
*  Well, when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, Council of Foreign Relations had just opened up a D.C. office there, New York based. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2124.74s)]
*  And she went over to them and she made a speech and she said, thank you, foreign relations, for opening up your D.C. office. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2130.7s)]
*  That way, I don't need to travel all the way to New York to be told what to do. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2136.34s)]
*  I was the head of the State Department. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2144.14s)]
*  She said it like that. Yeah, everyone can look this up. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2145.86s)]
*  I might not be verbatim, but that was that was the it was it was as explicit as that effectively. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2149.74s)]
*  But if you want to play this, I remember going over convincing our team or others to convincing that we should be providing for loan guarantees. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2157.9399999999996s)]
*  And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Keefe. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2166.9799999999996s)]
*  And I was going supposed to announce that there is another billion dollar loan guarantee. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2172.3399999999997s)]
*  And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2177.42s)]
*  And they didn't. So they said they had they were walking out to press. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2185.58s)]
*  I said, no, I said, I'm not going to we're not going to give you the billion dollars. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2188.7000000000003s)]
*  They said, you have no authority. You're not the president. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2193.5s)]
*  The president said, I said, call him. I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting a billion dollars. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2195.7000000000003s)]
*  I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2201.46s)]
*  I think it was what, six hours. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2203.74s)]
*  I look at it and I said, we're leaving in six hours. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2205.06s)]
*  If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2207.1s)]
*  Well, son of a bitch. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2210.1s)]
*  You got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2212.5s)]
*  Solid. So they made some genuine, substantial changes institutionally and with people. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2217.98s)]
*  Yeah. So there's there's two things to immediately follow up on that. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2226.74s)]
*  So, Jamie, I just I just sent you two things over over text here. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2230.34s)]
*  The first one is the US is that billion dollar loan guarantee. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2237.42s)]
*  And then I sent you another one about securing commitments. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2242.3s)]
*  And then it's just wild that someone would be so brazen to talk about that so publicly. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2246.6600000000003s)]
*  It's that no one's going to look at someone that was solid. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2255.3s)]
*  What was wrong with the first guy? Let's go into depth. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2258.38s)]
*  The fact that you wouldn't think like maybe someone's going to investigate. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2261.2200000000003s)]
*  What was the first guy looking into? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2263.78s)]
*  Oh, why was my son running perisma? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2265.78s)]
*  Like, what is going? Why is he making 10 million dollars a year there? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2268.1400000000003s)]
*  What is going on? What is this? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2270.58s)]
*  Well, OK, so this was a billion. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2272.9s)]
*  OK, so this will actually go to the go to the other. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2274.58s)]
*  OK, we'll start with this. OK. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2276.9s)]
*  So here's from USAID. USAID announces. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2278.7000000000003s)]
*  Now, this is, again, the the basically the final months of the Obama administration. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2281.2200000000003s)]
*  Right. This is right before the November 2016 election. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2286.54s)]
*  USAID announces a billion dollar loan guarantee. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2289.42s)]
*  Remember, he referenced the loan. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2291.7799999999997s)]
*  By the way, do they pay these loans back? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2292.9s)]
*  Well, depends on if they play ball or not. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2295.58s)]
*  You know, this is this is this is another one of these things. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2298.8199999999997s)]
*  Right. If you're a good boy and you do what the blob tells you to do, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2301.3399999999997s)]
*  maybe we can be flexible on loan forgiveness. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2305.58s)]
*  You know, maybe we can allow you to punt punt the default. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2307.94s)]
*  But you'll see it's it's a bit. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2311.22s)]
*  But these are the carrots and sticks. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2312.94s)]
*  This is why we infiltrate and co-opt these institutions [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2314.34s)]
*  and why you have a 44 billion dollar annual slush fund around the world to do this. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2317.38s)]
*  But you'll see the issuance of the billion dollar loan guarantee to the governing [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2322.6600000000003s)]
*  and of government of Ukraine. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2325.6200000000003s)]
*  And it's to support the implementation of governance reforms. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2328.02s)]
*  So it's for it's it's for the the we condition it on you changing [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2332.2200000000003s)]
*  the policies of your government. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2337.1400000000003s)]
*  And this is already 2016 after we installed a coup. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2338.58s)]
*  Yes. In 2014. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2343.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes. Yes. And remember the last time I was here, we went over the 2019 [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2345.02s)]
*  Zelensky's first month in office, the Red Lines memo. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2349.58s)]
*  You know, talk about how do you how do you prove you're a good boy? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2352.74s)]
*  Well, when you get the Red Lines memo that you will suffer political instability [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2355.34s)]
*  unless you do the 25 below listed policy things with your government, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2359.1s)]
*  you know, that factors into what the U.S. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2363.74s)]
*  ambassador in the region will tell their Ukrainian or other government counterparts. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2366.58s)]
*  You know, loan guarantees and whatnot are conditioned on. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2371.9s)]
*  But so if you go to the you'll notice that Biden there used a very specific [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2375.58s)]
*  phrase there about securing commitments. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2379.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know if everyone caught that. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2382.02s)]
*  I want to note the the the similarity of that to if you go to the [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2383.38s)]
*  the other screenshot, Jamie, that text you hear. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2387.66s)]
*  I'm sorry that my my mug is on this. I just pulled this up. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2389.9s)]
*  What are you doing with your lips? Yeah, I know. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2392.66s)]
*  We'd been talking right before we started filming about [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2396.3399999999997s)]
*  about just throwing receipts up on screen. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2398.58s)]
*  This is just a live stream series that I do on X. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2400.02s)]
*  And so that's the culture mid words. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2402.42s)]
*  I know. I know. But this is one point five million dollars. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2404.5s)]
*  So so USAID is has given twenty seven million dollars [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2406.86s)]
*  in grants to the Tide Center, which is the five one C three [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2411.7s)]
*  is the fiscal sponsor that gives the five one C three stats [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2416.34s)]
*  to the Black Lives Matter Global Network and to a group called Fair [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2419.38s)]
*  and Just Prosecution, which is basically manages [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2423.34s)]
*  prosecutors who are simultaneously funded by the Open [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2427.66s)]
*  Open Society Foundation. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2430.66s)]
*  They work with Alvin Bragg and Letitia James and all these other other ones. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2431.74s)]
*  And so but you'll see here in this, this is a one point five million dollar [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2435.42s)]
*  grant, you'll see that exact phrase that Joe Biden used about [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2438.66s)]
*  securing commitments from governments. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2443.62s)]
*  To fight corruption. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2447.22s)]
*  So sometimes this diplomatic statecraft, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2449.46s)]
*  this strong arm pressure is done directly by the vice president. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2453.2999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes it's done by interlocutors like our state sponsored [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2456.8599999999997s)]
*  NGO swarm who allow our ambassadors and allow the White House [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2461.06s)]
*  to maintain a layer of plausible liability that it's [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2465.54s)]
*  it's an intermediary saying it. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2469.74s)]
*  And they can say much harsher things than what can be [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2471.4199999999996s)]
*  conveyed and may be used against you in a formal diplomatic channel. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2475.2999999999997s)]
*  And I said I said one more thing, Jamie, if you pull up, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2479.02s)]
*  if you go to my ex feed and you just type in the phrase USAID, Barisma, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2481.5s)]
*  because this is another element of this again. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2485.98s)]
*  How is this all weaponized at home and whatnot? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2487.66s)]
*  So Victor Shokin was investigating Barisma. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2490.14s)]
*  Joe Biden personally weaponized USAID in order to force [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2494.26s)]
*  a foreign country's prosecutor to be fired in order to get that billion. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2498.9s)]
*  Can I can I stop you for saying what was the investigation of Barisma? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2503.26s)]
*  What did it entail? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2507.02s)]
*  Well, I believe it was a similar corruption, you know, corruption probe [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2508.26s)]
*  that there was, you know, that there was misuse of funding. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2511.7s)]
*  All this stuff is is [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2514.46s)]
*  well documented in Miranda Devine's book, The Big Guy. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2517.34s)]
*  But if you if so, if you if you open those those four four screenshots [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2521.14s)]
*  and if you're able to center it or zoom out a little bit. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2528.2200000000003s)]
*  Western protection is a great fucking title. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2530.54s)]
*  USAID help young Biden. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2534.2200000000003s)]
*  This is in 2014. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2535.54s)]
*  Hey, remember when Hunter Biden's permanent [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2536.9s)]
*  blanket pardon goes back to it goes back to 2014. Right. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2540.34s)]
*  And so so this directs USAID to guarantee loans. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2544.46s)]
*  So it's loan guarantees for every phase of development of oil and gas [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2549.78s)]
*  in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2553.94s)]
*  Now, if you go to go to the next screenshot in this. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2555.06s)]
*  This is from this is a, you know, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2559.14s)]
*  a FOIA or legally obtained internal document at the State Department, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2565.5s)]
*  which says despite his ruin name in Ukraine, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2571.9s)]
*  so Chesky is actively campaigning for he's been sending letters to ambassadors. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2573.98s)]
*  You know, Yovanovitch and Piot. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2578.5s)]
*  They note that Hunter Biden and Devon Archer on the board. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2581.74s)]
*  And they say even internally at state USAID does have cooperation [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2584.86s)]
*  with with Burisma says preexisting small scale preexisting cooperation. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2590.38s)]
*  They're formally cooperating with Burisma in the region. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2594.74s)]
*  They're noting that. And then if you go to the next screenshot. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2598.38s)]
*  Now, now, this, again, is is State Department email traffic that's been on Earth. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2602.18s)]
*  OK, so they're talking about doing co branding with USAID and Burisma [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2607.38s)]
*  and the public private partnership around USAID and Burisma. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2614.98s)]
*  But then noting, quote, the very sticky wicket of the Hunter Biden [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2620.02s)]
*  connection on Burisma's board. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2623.7799999999997s)]
*  And then they go on to say that, you know, they want to create [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2627.46s)]
*  incentives for journalists to ensure responsible and unbiased coverage. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2631.18s)]
*  Very sticky wicket. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2634.74s)]
*  What a weird way to phrase that in an official email. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2636.4199999999996s)]
*  Right. What they're saying is it would be a major scandal [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2639.8999999999996s)]
*  if everyone knew the extent of it. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2642.58s)]
*  They know it looks unseemly. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2644.2599999999998s)]
*  They don't want they don't want the media to report on on the massive [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2645.7s)]
*  conflict of interest of Joe Biden going in and kicking out that prosecutor [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2649.7799999999997s)]
*  and conditioning USAID money on it while USAID is directly working with Burisma. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2653.8999999999996s)]
*  But then the State Department using its media [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2658.34s)]
*  mockingbird apparatus funded by your tax dollars, the swarm of NGOs, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2661.7s)]
*  you know, as reported publicly this week that 90 percent of Ukrainian [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2665.7400000000002s)]
*  media outlets are funded by the US government. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2668.82s)]
*  Ninety percent talk about a USAID Truman show. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2670.94s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2673.86s)]
*  And so who if they're funded by the State Department, guess what? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2674.98s)]
*  There's a State Department grant coordinator. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2678.06s)]
*  Guess what? If they want to keep keep getting their contributions, they are going to. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2679.86s)]
*  There's going to need to be review and approval by USAID and and by state [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2683.5s)]
*  because often these are these are co-grants. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2687.74s)]
*  And so they have the capacity to ensure that the incentives [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2689.8599999999997s)]
*  are aligned for the journalists to. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2694.8199999999997s)]
*  Be responsible with the way they report on the USAID, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2697.62s)]
*  Burisma connection, while Joe Biden is weaponizing. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2700.14s)]
*  Well, Joe is weaponizing USAID to to protect Burisma. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2704.54s)]
*  By the way, I should note, Hunter Biden's law firm actually pitched [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2708.22s)]
*  using Burisma as an instrument of statecraft to the State Department, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2710.8999999999996s)]
*  because the more you capacity build Burisma, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2715.34s)]
*  the more endogenous gas Ukraine is able to supply. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2718.98s)]
*  And so that's less gas being exported into Europe from Gazprom in Russia. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2722.78s)]
*  So they blend this. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2727.94s)]
*  It advances U.S. national interest, but hey, it makes us rich along the way. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2729.06s)]
*  So, you know, it's the same reason Pfizer gets to keep all the profits, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2732.06s)]
*  you know, for, you know, when when they have when there's a mandate, a vaccine mandate, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2735.94s)]
*  you know, they don't they say, well, we're just rewarding, you know, this [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2739.9s)]
*  we're doing such good work. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2743.26s)]
*  Well, if this is a charity, why aren't you giving the money back to the American people? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2744.5s)]
*  You know, of well, should we put some cap on this? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2748.66s)]
*  And I know we're incentivizing this, you know, pioneering approach [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2750.5s)]
*  and we're uniquely in the position to do it. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2753.78s)]
*  And what's important about this is this explains for a lot of people [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2755.66s)]
*  that are very baffled by obvious propaganda and misinformation [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2759.62s)]
*  that's being propagated by the mainstream media. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2764.02s)]
*  When you look at mainstream newspapers and television shows [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2767.18s)]
*  saying things that are just factually incorrect and you could research it. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2771.7s)]
*  It's not hard to find out. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2777.2999999999997s)]
*  And you see them propagate this stuff. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2779.3399999999997s)]
*  This is all the same sort of thing. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2781.62s)]
*  But this is happening on U.S. soil. Oh, exactly. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2783.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, actually, Jamie, if you pull that receipt back up, there's a there's a paragraph [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2786.3799999999997s)]
*  there we didn't read, but that's that's useful to this. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2789.14s)]
*  And then there's another topic related to this that I think makes this point even harder. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2791.42s)]
*  But look, look at that fourth paragraph there. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2795.42s)]
*  This is from the U.S. State Department, which is in control [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2797.5s)]
*  of managing all of the media assets, those 90 percent of media assets in Ukraine [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2800.7s)]
*  and the ones that simultaneously operate here. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2804.7799999999997s)]
*  I would offer that Burisma's incentive to support could possibly read [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2807.1s)]
*  the main objective of Burisma was to create incentives for journalists [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2810.1s)]
*  to offer sympathetic coverage. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2813.62s)]
*  Wow. Main objective of Burisma, the main objective. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2816.42s)]
*  It's an energy corporation. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2820.58s)]
*  Yes, yes. Humanitarian aid. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2821.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, this is a for profit company that's directly tied. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2824.94s)]
*  Such a wild statement. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2827.7799999999997s)]
*  The main objective of Burisma was to create incentives for journalists [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2829.1s)]
*  to offer sympathetic coverage of the company on energy issues. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2833.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes, yes. Wow. Right. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2837.1s)]
*  They want to pitch it as a sort of, you know, patriotic, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2839.74s)]
*  you know, pro pro-Western. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2844.02s)]
*  They bought the media. They bought the media. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2846.98s)]
*  They bought the media and they bought the media here. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2848.54s)]
*  On that topic, can we talk about a related [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2851.98s)]
*  scandal and frankly, monstrosity that the American people need [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2854.98s)]
*  to understand the full extent of its of its influence on American hearts and minds? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2859.42s)]
*  No, we can't talk about that. OK. All right. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2863.38s)]
*  Well, let's go on to the next thing. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2865.42s)]
*  OK. So, Jamie, if you if you go to X, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2867.7s)]
*  I think probably the best thread on this currently published [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2871.86s)]
*  is the WikiLeaks thread on on internews, which just reading some of the statistics [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2875.86s)]
*  and that will help make sense of some of the clips and screenshots [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2880.78s)]
*  that I'm going to show you about its operations [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2885.0600000000004s)]
*  that then impact domestic affairs and and [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2889.2200000000003s)]
*  international governments that are allied with this with the state [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2892.5s)]
*  with the State Department. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2895.6600000000003s)]
*  So if you just look up into just type in the word internews, one word, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2896.38s)]
*  I N T E R N E W S. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2899.6200000000003s)]
*  And and you go to search down the WikiLeaks profile, you'll see. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2903.26s)]
*  Yeah, here you go. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2908.7400000000002s)]
*  If you just top that that top one, you know, USAID is pushing really have to. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2909.9s)]
*  So this so internews I've been I've been talking about for a long time, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2913.5800000000004s)]
*  but now the stage is sort of set to really show the extent of this. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2917.38s)]
*  But. What we do is we create these pretty little predicates, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2921.5800000000004s)]
*  these pretty little lie words, weasel words to hide from the American people [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2927.3s)]
*  and especially from foreign governments, what we're really doing in the area. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2931.5400000000004s)]
*  So we have a catchphrase at at state and in state craft. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2934.78s)]
*  It's called independent media. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2938.34s)]
*  You can think of that as the State Department's word for good guy. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2940.78s)]
*  OK, doesn't mean independent. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2944.1s)]
*  They are funded by us. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2945.3s)]
*  They are not independent from the government. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2946.46s)]
*  They literally submit their work and approval plans for their work plans [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2948.3s)]
*  for what they cover for review and approval to the US State Department. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2952.54s)]
*  They are dog walked the whole way. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2955.58s)]
*  But we call them independent because they are said to be independent [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2958.1800000000003s)]
*  from foreign governments who influence. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2961.06s)]
*  So basically they're independent from the Chinese government [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2963.54s)]
*  or they're independent from the Russian government. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2967.1800000000003s)]
*  So there's just like with the word USAID itself that we talked about last time. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2968.98s)]
*  It's your mind playing tricks on you. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2973.2200000000003s)]
*  You're seeing aid, but it's agency for international development. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2974.6200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2977.6600000000003s)]
*  So nothing. But they do the same thing with independent media, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2978.6600000000003s)]
*  which is that internally to them, it means it's a good guy for us [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2982.06s)]
*  because it's independent from our enemies. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2986.86s)]
*  But when Americans see that, they think, well, independent, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2988.86s)]
*  that means it's a free actor who's not being sponsored by any government. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2991.78s)]
*  But under the banner of USAID's independent media and media sustainability branches, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=2996.1s)]
*  we fund half a billion dollars a year to this network of, again, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3001.62s)]
*  over 4000 media outlets. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3007.74s)]
*  It reaches 778 million people, 9000 journalists trained. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3011.34s)]
*  9000 journalists trained. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3015.42s)]
*  Remember last time we went over the Atlanta Council with seven CIA directors [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3017.1800000000003s)]
*  and annual funding from USAID, as well as the State Department of Pentagon, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3022.06s)]
*  how they were holding up I-Call BS placards [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3025.62s)]
*  and putting Trump tweets on screen to flag for disinformation. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3029.38s)]
*  If you remember, we went over that. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3033.82s)]
*  Well, this is what training journalists looks like. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3034.86s)]
*  Is they is is not only do they have the direct spawn of of of a media octopus [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3037.2599999999998s)]
*  under their direct subgrantee group, but they then go out and train [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3047.1s)]
*  the journalists who work at all the other ones who aren't directly sponsored. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3052.14s)]
*  So they reach everywhere. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3054.7799999999997s)]
*  And you'll see here, for example, it makes reference to to, you know, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3056.66s)]
*  Gene Burgo, who is, you know, making half a million dollars a year there. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3060.54s)]
*  And if you go now, I'm going to show this this domestic impact real quick [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3065.34s)]
*  and then a couple of screenshots. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3069.54s)]
*  So if you this is this has been going viral on X. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3070.46s)]
*  I've been talking about USAID's role in the censorship industry forever. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3073.7000000000003s)]
*  And if you look up, if you just look up internews and you just plug in the name, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3076.7400000000002s)]
*  you know, if you just copy paste that, you know, Gene Burgo phrase, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3081.02s)]
*  you'll see this in the video section because it's everywhere now. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3086.1400000000003s)]
*  So so she made speeches for a long time, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3089.38s)]
*  but this is a this is a big one. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3095.14s)]
*  Here you go. This one right here. OK. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3098.46s)]
*  So USAID funded internews CEO pushes for global advertising [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3100.7799999999997s)]
*  exclusion list to censor disinformation. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3104.42s)]
*  So the twenty second clip. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3107.58s)]
*  Like what they did to X. Yeah, exactly. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3110.22s)]
*  Disinformation makes money, and it's one of them. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3112.2599999999998s)]
*  We need to follow that money and we need to work with the [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3114.9s)]
*  and particularly the global advertising industry that a lot of those dollars [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3117.7s)]
*  go to pretty bad, bad content. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3121.18s)]
*  And so you can work really hard on exclusion lists or inclusion [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3124.2999999999997s)]
*  lists or really try to focus ad dollars and challenge [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3126.8999999999996s)]
*  the global advertising industry all around the world to focus their ad dollars [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3130.2999999999997s)]
*  towards the good, the good news and information, the good, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3134.14s)]
*  the accurate and relevant news and information. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3137.14s)]
*  So so this is USAID sponsoring both sides of this. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3140.18s)]
*  She runs a five hundred million dollar [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3144.06s)]
*  mercenary media for for hippies for hire empire sponsored by the by USAID. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3146.3799999999997s)]
*  USAID also gave sixty eight million dollars to the World Economic Forum itself. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3151.82s)]
*  And and USAID's own internal documents show the explicit [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3156.46s)]
*  political targeting of these advertiser networks. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3160.42s)]
*  And I can show you receipts on that if you just type in the word SEPS CEPPS [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3163.3s)]
*  and advertiser on my X timeline. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3168.86s)]
*  And I don't mean to just go receipt to receipt to receipt. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3171.1000000000004s)]
*  Actually, no, it's OK. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3173.5s)]
*  Actually, before we get to that, just so I can close the loop [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3174.86s)]
*  on something that's a little bit more accessible and less political. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3177.06s)]
*  Jamie, I texted you a screenshot of internews in in Brazil. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3180.1000000000004s)]
*  And if one of them has at the top of it, something called Rooted in Trust. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3186.94s)]
*  Yeah, if you keep going up. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3196.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. That one. Yeah. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3198.82s)]
*  OK, so this is internews with a worldwide media octopus [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3200.7400000000002s)]
*  sponsored a half a billion dollars a year. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3205.6200000000003s)]
*  You know, reaching nine thousand journalists, five thousand media outlets. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3208.98s)]
*  And here's what they were doing just in just on just on covid censorship. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3212.74s)]
*  So Rooted in Trust is a internews program. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3219.98s)]
*  It's a global pandemic information response program [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3223.74s)]
*  to counter the unprecedented scale and speed and spread of rumors and misinformation. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3226.5s)]
*  All which turned out to be true. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3231.3399999999997s)]
*  All of which turned out to be true. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3232.9s)]
*  Our own CIA says that our own house [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3234.1s)]
*  oversight committee says says that now every single step of the way. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3238.18s)]
*  There's not one thing they said that turned out to be accurate, not the death rate, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3241.66s)]
*  not the ability to stop infections and transmissions, not the side effects, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3245.78s)]
*  not the fact that natural immunity is far superior. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3252.14s)]
*  None of it. Not nothing. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3255.7000000000003s)]
*  Not one thing, not the lab leak theory. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3257.34s)]
*  Nothing. Not even the funding of the research. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3259.86s)]
*  And the actual lab, which is also USAID, right? Yes. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3264.1s)]
*  Yes. Fifty million dollars. Right. Right. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3267.02s)]
*  From UC Davis to EcoHealth directly into it. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3269.86s)]
*  Because I always say when it's too dirty for the CIA, you give it to USAID. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3273.3s)]
*  And that's and that's why, you know, that's why you have all this pandemic stuff. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3276.54s)]
*  Maybe we can get to that later. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3280.02s)]
*  But I want to show the scale of this. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3280.98s)]
*  You sponsored your own. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3282.94s)]
*  State censorship rooted in trust is tracked more than [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3285.86s)]
*  19000 rumors about the virus across 14 plus languages globally, over 81 million people. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3289.22s)]
*  In response to the unique rumors sourced from each country context, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3297.98s)]
*  this USAID sponsored project has produced a total of over 130 rumor bulletins, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3301.8599999999997s)]
*  500 radio broadcasts and 480 media stories [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3308.4199999999996s)]
*  through a series of training opportunities, events, peer to peer networks [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3312.5s)]
*  and small grants. Root and Trust has supported 550 local media organizations in order to [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3315.54s)]
*  scan and ban the Internet. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3323.54s)]
*  Or more importantly, to connect communities with directly with timely and accurate [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3325.86s)]
*  COVID-19 information, which all turned out to be lies. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3331.22s)]
*  I only had time before this to text one page of this. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3334.42s)]
*  I mean, this is everyone should go through this this document. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3336.94s)]
*  I'll post on my ex feed. And there's there's millions around this. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3339.78s)]
*  I mean, this the whole global coordination was done through this through USAID and the US State Department [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3342.66s)]
*  and its partners in the in the UK and in NATO. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3349.2999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, the fact that these very organs are implicated in it, these strange DARPA grants around creating [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3353.18s)]
*  the the great the gain of function, you know, the USAID, you know, grants that we're all jumping, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3358.74s)]
*  you know, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3367.78s)]
*  animal to human for these things, you know, the presence of folks like Avril Haines, the deputy director of the CIA, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3369.1800000000003s)]
*  and then head of director of the director of national intelligence, you know, at these censorship planning [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3375.78s)]
*  conferences for event 201, the fact that [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3381.46s)]
*  state and DOD and the UK Foreign Office all funded all of the censorship organs like the Atlantic Council and [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3384.5400000000004s)]
*  Grafica and these others that we went over last time, you know, they basically they're the prime suspect for the crime [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3392.5s)]
*  and they and they sponsored the entire white blood cell apparatus to swarm any [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3398.94s)]
*  kernel of truth penetrating the membrane in order to orchestrate the cover-up. So they're on both sides of it. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3405.1800000000003s)]
*  And we can talk about more about the you know, the inner news work there, but I want to but I want to [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3412.1400000000003s)]
*  This is the darkest of conspiracy theories the darkest of conspiracy theories was that the leak was intentional [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3419.14s)]
*  The darkest of conspiracy theories is that this was planned. They knew this is gonna be a financial windfall [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3426.3399999999997s)]
*  It is the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the United States by far from the working class to the elite [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3432.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like three plus what trillion dollars or something crazy like that. Yeah [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3440.22s)]
*  We've already established that it was created in a lab. We already established that USAID funded it [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3445.4s)]
*  We already established that Fauci at all lied about gain-of-function research what they were doing [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3452.04s)]
*  The worst theory possible is that this was released on purpose. Yeah, that would be the worst-case scenario. Yeah, have you ever [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3459.6800000000003s)]
*  danced that one around your head [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3467.12s)]
*  Because that's that's where you [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3469.72s)]
*  We know they're willing to do horrible evil shit, but like is there a ceiling on that? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3471.7599999999998s)]
*  Even now to this day having spent [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3481.4s)]
*  So much of my life in it [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3484.8399999999997s)]
*  I try I try to just pursue the leads that I have and then try to let the conclusions come to me [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3486.44s)]
*  Certainly the fact that they funded [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3494.24s)]
*  The capacity to do this [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3497.1200000000003s)]
*  They work directly with all the networks that were both doing it and censoring it is [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3499.32s)]
*  Puts you pretty much as you know, they created it and they covered up at least the leak [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3506.6800000000003s)]
*  In terms of the the intentionality for doing it [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3513.84s)]
*  That is a really dark scenario, you know, there are a lot of things in American history [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3519.6400000000003s)]
*  That that have that same, you know [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3523.88s)]
*  Me ha li ha distinction, you know [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3527.1200000000003s)]
*  Do they do they make it happen or do they let it happen? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3529.1200000000003s)]
*  Do they let it happen or do they make it happen and both of them are major scandals that completely change [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3532.32s)]
*  the the the legitimacy and credibility of policy changes in response to the crisis for example, like [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3538.96s)]
*  You know take something like Pearl Harbor, right? It's been declassified now the McCullum memo the eight action plan [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3545.44s)]
*  You know the eight action plan you familiar with with this the yeah, yeah [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3551.68s)]
*  You know and this was you know written [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3556.2s)]
*  Before the the the bombing and it was eight ways to get Japan to attack us [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3559.2s)]
*  because you know, we don't have diplomatic cover to declare war on them, but if [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3564.3599999999997s)]
*  If if we get them to attack us and we can then spiral that into a war predicate [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3568.52s)]
*  I mean the same thing for example with the you know, the Northwoods memo with you know [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3573.64s)]
*  Pretext to war with Cuba and cooking up all these, you know hijacking our own planes sinking our own ships [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3577.48s)]
*  Doing you know riots on the streets of Miami and then saying that it was the other Cuban government behind it [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3583.1600000000003s)]
*  You can same thing with Vietnam Gulf of Tonkin, you know same thing with the you know with the the weapons of mass destruction [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3589.36s)]
*  Predicate for invading Iraq. Did we know that that would do? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3597.96s)]
*  Did we were we duped and the crime was negligence for [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3601.24s)]
*  Letting our national security state believe the New York Times reporting on you know on chemical and you know and biological and weapons of mass destruction [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3605.92s)]
*  in Iraq or did we make that happen do we [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3614.3599999999997s)]
*  Did you was that he was that something that we knew was not true based on our own intelligence? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3619.12s)]
*  But because there was a useful thing there and [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3626.2799999999997s)]
*  you know a lot of people have the same thoughts about issues around of around 9-11 and any number of crisis events and I I [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3628.8s)]
*  Suppose I have my own thoughts on it [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3637.56s)]
*  They're not fully settled and because they are beyond the evidence. I currently have [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3639.6s)]
*  I I stay in the zone of this is what they did to create it. This is what they did to cover it up [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3645.72s)]
*  Here the stars in the sky draw your own constellation from there. Mm-hmm [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3652.52s)]
*  That's a good way to put it. Okay back to what you were just about to talk about. Yeah, so well, so [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3657.1600000000003s)]
*  Again, there's there's two simultaneous tasks that I have [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3664.1600000000003s)]
*  One is to burn down these these rogue institutions that have been weaponized [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3667.84s)]
*  Domestically and salt the earth behind them so that these kind of excesses can never come home again [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3672.88s)]
*  The other one is [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3678.8s)]
*  We do need us soft power projection in order to maintain the standard of living and prosperity that we have [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3680.8s)]
*  You know, I give the example all the time. No blob. No pencils [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3686.8s)]
*  you can't make pencils in this country unless you depend on governments in Malaysia and South America and [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3690.2400000000002s)]
*  you know parts of Africa and if that's the case in [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3696.6000000000004s)]
*  You know for pencils now do that exercise with petroleum now do that that exercise with cobalt. For example [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3701.1200000000003s)]
*  There's only one there was only one operational cobalt mine in all of the US and in 2022 that even that mine shut down [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3707.14s)]
*  So most of the cobalt's in the Congo if you if the if the Congolese government decides [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3714.98s)]
*  They don't want to allow you access to cobalt [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3720.1s)]
*  Well, there goes your capacity to to create any high technology or renewable battery or anything [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3721.98s)]
*  There is potentially a need for some modified and more honest [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3729.22s)]
*  Restrictions on our Department of dirty tricks, for example, the CIA used to be allowed to assassinate world leaders [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3733.88s)]
*  In the in the 40s and 50s, you know [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3739.16s)]
*  this is where we got in trouble in Congo with Lumumba or you know, I end there and any number of these and then [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3741.08s)]
*  when those scandals got revealed there were [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3747.04s)]
*  legislative reforms put in place and [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3750.44s)]
*  Executive branch now national security reforms put in place to say, okay, you can do dirty work, but not that dirty. You can't do that [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3752.88s)]
*  The same thing needs to be done now for all of these things, you know many categories of things for example [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3759.62s)]
*  We just played internews and the internews CEO [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3765.7s)]
*  campaigning to [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3770.18s)]
*  Governments and corporations and private sector civil society organizations around the world [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3772.98s)]
*  That they need to economically blacklist [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3779.1s)]
*  News sites that that operate on social media and those are US news sites [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3782.8599999999997s)]
*  That's this is the basis of lawsuits here in the US like daily wire in the Federalist suing the State Department [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3787.2999999999997s)]
*  for because US news sites are in these advertiser blacklists and [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3793.8999999999996s)]
*  To that end I want to I want to note two things first [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3798.74s)]
*  if you if you go to my ex feed and you type in the word advertiser or [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3801.3799999999997s)]
*  Advertisers and if you need to you can plug in the word USAID or CEPPS in this [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3804.9399999999996s)]
*  And I want to show you that that this is not [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3811.5400000000004s)]
*  Internews gone wrong. This is not a [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3814.82s)]
*  Half a billion dollar a year grantee of USAID going rogue and being ideological about this. This is top-down [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3817.46s)]
*  US government policy from the White House and I'll show you the documents on that [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3824.86s)]
*  To the White House executive branch agencies like USAID and state [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3829.5400000000004s)]
*  Okay [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3834.5s)]
*  If you go to search and you put in the word advertiser advertiser. Yeah [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3836.1000000000004s)]
*  And [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3841.6200000000003s)]
*  It could be advertiser or advertisers, okay, so you there you go, so click on that left the left image first [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3844.02s)]
*  This is now we talked about this group CEPPS last time [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3852.38s)]
*  you know in our in our hit a few months ago CEPPS is a program that is [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3855.82s)]
*  basically a joint baby of USAID and the State Department and is implemented by the by USAID's key operational arm the National Down for [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3861.6200000000003s)]
*  Democracy, but this is a USAID program on [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3869.8199999999997s)]
*  Countering disinformation internet censorship is what they do and we went over last time [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3873.62s)]
*  I remember we played that that two-minute video where they were [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3876.94s)]
*  openly saying that the plan is to get foreign governments to [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3879.74s)]
*  Pass legal reform pass laws and regulations to stop the spread of misinformation on US social media websites [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3883.42s)]
*  So USA USA would not be able to lobby the US government to do that because we have a First Amendment Europe doesn't [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3890.14s)]
*  Brazil doesn't but here is from an internal document February 2021 of USAID's program and [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3896.46s)]
*  Now this is a 97 page document. They reference the word advertiser and advertising in this document 31 times in 97 pages [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3904.06s)]
*  So this is that was three years before that clip [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3912.5s)]
*  We just saw how far back in motion this is and I can go back even further that in 2017 and share clips on that [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3914.2999999999997s)]
*  And how this network coordinated the very ad? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3919.54s)]
*  Boycotts that that Elon is subject to and that brought Facebook and Google to their knees when they folded to advertiser boycotts [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3922.9s)]
*  They go in order to disrupt the funding and financial incentive using the same phrases that the Internet CEO did to disinform [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3929.38s)]
*  Attention is is turned to the advertising industry particularly with online advertising [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3938.42s)]
*  So they so it goes on to say thus cutting the financial support in the ad tech space would obstruct [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3943.74s)]
*  Disinformation actors, they're not human beings [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3950.1s)]
*  They're not Americans with you know running mom-and-pop shops that depend on their Facebook page to be able to promote [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3952.02s)]
*  You know advertise their flower business. No, they're they're they're reduced to the inhuman disinformation actors from spreading messaging online [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3958.18s)]
*  So the efforts being made to inform advertisers of the risk such as the threat to brand safety. So this is USAID saying [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3966.94s)]
*  We got to talk to these advertisers and say hey, you know [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3974.46s)]
*  Brand safety is really important to all your little all your brands [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3978.02s)]
*  It would be a shame if you were known for putting ads next to misinformation websites like daily wire and the Federalist [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3981.06s)]
*  That goes on to say additionally with this data [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3988.06s)]
*  Organizations and these are partner organizations this group steps runs [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3991.46s)]
*  You know is together with USAID and and and the state part of their run network of hundreds of NGOs around the world that all jointly [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=3994.9s)]
*  Carry this out. This is what they're sponsored to do says the aim is to redirect funding to higher quality news domains and improve [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4001.58s)]
*  regulatory and market environments regulatory means laws laws laws about this like the EU Digital Services Act [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4010.2200000000003s)]
*  Redirect so this is a top-down US government plan to financially re-engineer the entire economics of [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4017.62s)]
*  The news industry in order to make it so that if you spread messaging against the state [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4026.1s)]
*  Or against a sensitive policy issue by the state you are put out of business [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4032.74s)]
*  You cannot professionalize you can't compete with CNN or New York Times or MSNBC [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4036.3399999999997s)]
*  You just like this is what happened to Breitbart for example, and they got caught up in this web [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4041.2999999999997s)]
*  They lost 99% of their advertising revenue. They were going up like this and however you feel about Breitbart [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4044.58s)]
*  This is these are the these are the plain facts of this inaction [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4049.1s)]
*  They were a rising star in the 2016 election Steve Bannon who was you know the head of that went on to be that [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4053.26s)]
*  Basically the top White House advisor directly [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4057.5s)]
*  They got crushed when 99% of their ad revenue they this is why everyone's having to switch to bilking [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4060.38s)]

*  Or implementers signatories to the eu's code of practice on disinformation [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4250.14s)]
*  Which if us tech companies don't comply with what the eu a foreign body calls disinformation [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4254.4s)]
*  The penalties for that are losing six percent of us social media companies global annual revenue [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4260.0s)]
*  Or get kicked out of the entire eu market, which is 550 million people [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4266.8s)]

*  Information integrity. This is one of these censorship weasel weasel phrases weasel words [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4309.12s)]

*  Redirecting ad revenue from high quality high quality news outlets to low quality news outlets [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4317.9s)]
*  They make that determination by determining high integrity news and low integrity news [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4323.36s)]
*  So basically if they like you they call you high integrity if they don't like you or you're publishing a scandal or you say [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4327.84s)]

*  But they call them researchers to make it look passive rather than active [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4446.0s)]
*  And I can go through a million examples of that to show how deep that lie goes with access to social media data [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4449.2s)]
*  Accessible under the 2022 EU code of practice on disinformation [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4454.54s)]

*  Inside web should be able to get access to this [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4489.5s)]
*  But what they're saying is the u.s. Government can't pry that out of facebook's hands. We have a first amendment [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4491.52s)]

*  Uh under covert action, but us aid has a couple of cute tricks that make it the the central warehouse for all this and this is why [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4630.66s)]
*  You know when we started this conversation [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4639.22s)]
*  I was saying, you know [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4641.22s)]
*  You ain't seen nothing yet. This thing is going to get so deep and it's going to connect to so many institutions that everybody thought [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4642.820000000001s)]
*  You know like like in the truman show they thought it was their best friend [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4649.54s)]
*  You know, they thought this thing was totally independent and these were authentic conversations you're having with the cashier and it turns out [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4652.820000000001s)]
*  oops, okay, actually you're a part of this, you know us aid sponsored network or the state or dod or [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4658.18s)]
*  intel sponsored network because [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4663.46s)]
*  This is fundamentally covert action that's being done [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4665.780000000001s)]
*  and when [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4668.9800000000005s)]
*  When the when the cia [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4670.74s)]
*  The cia is subject to restrictions on the kind of covert activity it can do every covert action [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4672.66s)]
*  The cia does which is our organ for organized political warfare [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4676.9s)]
*  You know george kennan himself as well as william casey and colby and [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4681.219999999999s)]
*  Everyone the express purpose of it was to carry out the subversive side of the political struggle [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4686.42s)]
*  You know, uh, so that we'd have a mechanism for influencing [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4691.7s)]
*  foreign, you know the [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4695.219999999999s)]
*  foreign affairs by [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4697.139999999999s)]
*  Creating an internal what looks to be an organic [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4698.66s)]
*  You know, uh [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4702.9s)]
*  grassroots authentic network within the country [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4704.5s)]
*  But we're actually funding and directing their actions their actions to be favorable to u.s. Interest [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4707.54s)]
*  but where i'm going with this is [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4713.46s)]
*  us aid [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4716.099999999999s)]
*  is [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4717.62s)]
*  has most of the worst scandals [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4718.58s)]
*  of us statecraft [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4722.0199999999995s)]
*  And covert action in the past two decades have actually been from us aid rather than the cia and there's there's a reason for this so [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4724.42s)]
*  after the [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4731.14s)]
*  Big scandals against the democrats and and liberals and anti-war groups in the in the 60s and 70s reforms are put in place [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4732.26s)]
*  Every co and and some of this goes back to the fours itself [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4739.620000000001s)]
*  But every covert action the cia does has to be has to be authorized by the president and what's called the presidential finding [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4742.5s)]
*  To take that covert action [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4749.46s)]
*  So [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4751.78s)]
*  If this if the cia senior leadership or or just a rogue cell that's not even at the top of leadership, but just a [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4752.74s)]
*  A rogue desk a rogue portfolio portfolio a rogue network [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4760.26s)]
*  Wants to run a covert action in a region, but they don't think the president will approve [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4764.5s)]
*  Or the president doesn't want to formally sign off on it in case it goes it goes wrong [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4769.14s)]
*  They can walk right over to us aid who can do the exact same thing the cia does [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4774.26s)]
*  Except they can call it discrete democracy promotion because it's not technically an intelligence agency [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4779.22s)]
*  So it's not technically covert action. So it doesn't require [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4785.54s)]
*  executive branch approval or for knowledge and they've gotten in trouble on in these cases in some pretty incredible ways can can I [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4789.5199999999995s)]
*  show that please so [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4797.94s)]
*  Let's start with with even the whitewashed version go to the wikipedia of zun zunio zun [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4800.5s)]
*  Zeneo just on the wikipedia and then we can go deeper on this if you want [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4806.66s)]
*  This was a scandal during obama the obama usaid [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4812.98s)]
*  uh era [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4818.099999999999s)]
*  Now we were running a number of of rogue usaid operations in cuba at the time, by the way [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4819.46s)]
*  I have to say for the record. I'm no fan of the cuban government [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4824.74s)]
*  I i'm i'm not even weighing in on whether it's the right or wrong thing to do [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4827.78s)]
*  You know in terms of regime change there or you know [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4832.9s)]
*  Liberating people there from autocratic excess by that government. I'm simply showing the american people [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4836.72s)]
*  Where your tax dollars are going? [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4842.82s)]
*  And how these things are structured in order to systematically fool you and to fool congress and to fool the white house [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4844.82s)]
*  so for example, so this is [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4852.58s)]
*  This is and i'll show a couple other things in a second here [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4854.42s)]
*  But so this is zun zunio if yes, if you just scroll for a second [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4857.06s)]
*  We'll start with this right? So it was an online social media. Just scroll up one second. Let's start at the top here [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4860.58s)]
*  It was an online social social networking microblogging service created by usaid and marketed to cuban users [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4865.0599999999995s)]
*  this was a a twitter knockoff see the background of this is [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4871.22s)]
*  this is [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4875.46s)]
*  2009 2014 that period the state department in usaid were gangbusters gung-ho on the promise of [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4876.74s)]
*  Arab spring style social media revolutions to topple other governments that the arab spring was a facebook revolution and a twitter revolution [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4884.9800000000005s)]
*  USAID pumped 1.2 billion dollars in you know [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4892.900000000001s)]
*  And we sponsored these activist groups and these civil society organizations to learn how to use facebook learn how to use twitter learn how to use [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4896.1s)]
*  hashtags learn how to [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4903.92s)]
*  Coordinate street protests so that everyone knows where to go what street to show up on you know, what kind of? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4906.34s)]
*  Slogans to you know to use in order to create the pro-democracy [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4912.660000000001s)]
*  You know predicate for it [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4916.9800000000005s)]
*  But the problem was at the time cuba did not allow us social media in so they said hmm [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4918.42s)]
*  So they're not allowing twitter in [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4923.3s)]
*  How can we get a twitter there but without calling it twitter without making it look like it's coming from the us [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4926.26s)]
*  So what they did is they took the exact same thing as twitter same user interface same like and retweet button [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4932.820000000001s)]
*  Zunzunio is is the cuban slang word for for hummingbird? So it means it's bird. It was the twitter bird the whole thing [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4939.46s)]
*  um, but the whole trick about it was you have to [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4948.099999999999s)]
*  Make it look like it's coming from the cubans if you're going to do this operation. So what you'll see is [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4952.259999999999s)]
*  um [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4957.54s)]
*  It began running. So this is 2010. This is right, you know during the arab spring [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4958.74s)]
*  And what you'll see is they took funds millions of dollars of funds that were concealed [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4963.219999999999s)]
*  as humanitarian funds designated for pakistan [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4968.82s)]
*  now, I don't know if [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4973.38s)]
*  joe or the audience if you looked at a map lately, but [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4974.98s)]
*  Pakistan is not exactly the next door neighbor of cuba [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4978.42s)]
*  Right, so and this is the this is the wikipedia whitewashing and we can get into the deeper layers of this but [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4982.0199999999995s)]
*  Contractors funded by us8. I should note the main contractor was creative associates international. Who's a frequent one. It's cai cai not cia. I promise [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4987.599999999999s)]
*  So they they concealed in the budget from [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=4997.06s)]
*  Senate from congress from the white house national security council [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5000.820000000001s)]
*  They said that that these were humanitarian funds for pakistan [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5005.46s)]
*  And then they ran that to their contractor cai [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5009.860000000001s)]
*  Uh to quote set up a byzantine system of front companies using cayman islands bank accounts and recruiting unsuspecting business executives [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5014.1s)]
*  Who would not be told of the company's ties to the u.s. Government according to the ap [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5022.34s)]
*  The private companies like creative associates international designed the network the idea [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5026.9800000000005s)]
*  Arose after uh, they were given 500 000 stolen cuban cell phones that were available in the black market [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5031.9400000000005s)]
*  And then you'll see if you scroll down is uh, okay [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5039.06s)]
*  The network dubbed the the cuban twitter reached about 60 000 cuban subscribers [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5042.26s)]
*  The initiative appears to also have had a surveillance dimension allowing a quote vast database of cuban zunzano subscribers [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5046.98s)]
*  Including gender age and receptiveness and political tendencies to be built [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5053.46s)]
*  With the associate press noting such data could be used in the future for political purposes [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5057.78s)]
*  By the way, these are all in quotes from the internal documents and we can go through that [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5061.86s)]
*  The data would then be used for micro targeting efforts towards anti and pro government users in cuba [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5065.62s)]
*  The developers aimed to at first used non-controversial content such as sports and music and hurricane updates, by the way [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5070.74s)]
*  They they used hurricane updates in the internal things, you know, basically a humanitarian front that if you sign up to this app [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5077.38s)]
*  You'll you'll know about natural disasters in the area. Meanwhile, what was the plan the whole time? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5083.62s)]
*  Once they built up enough subscribers, they would begin to introduce political messages through social bots and encourage dissent [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5088.74s)]
*  Uh in this in this astroturfing there's a great guardian write-up on this [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5095.38s)]

*  But the whole point is once they hit a critical mass [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5137.14s)]
*  They would create rental riots [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5139.700000000001s)]
*  And and they would use this the same way they used it in egypt and tunisia to topple those governments under the obama administration [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5141.700000000001s)]
*  They would organize smart mobs rental riots and if uh [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5147.54s)]
*  And if you if you scroll down there's some you know, this this is a fantastic article highly recommend [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5151.54s)]

*  Okay [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5160.98s)]
*  Documents show the u.s government plan to build a subscriber base through non-controversial news content news messages on soccer music and hurricane updates [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5161.78s)]
*  This is in the guardian [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5169.299999999999s)]
*  uh [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5170.66s)]
*  Later when the network reached a critical mass perhaps hundreds of thousands operators would introduce political content aimed at inspiring cubans to organize quote smart mobs [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5171.7s)]
*  mass gatherings called in a moment's notice that might trigger a cuban spring or as one usa document put it quote [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5180.98s)]
*  renegotiate the balance of power between state and society and [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5187.92s)]
*  you know, so [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5193.219999999999s)]
*  One more thing if you if you want to look up on this you see how they how they conceal it if you just type in [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5195.0599999999995s)]
*  uh us aid zenzeneo and the word and uh, discrete [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5199.139999999999s)]
*  Or or discrete action and you'll see how us aid when when this scandal popped off [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5203.0599999999995s)]
*  Everyone said what the hell how did this happen? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5207.7s)]
*  Uh, this is classic cia work. You're using cayman islands bank accounts [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5211.22s)]
*  You're saying it's your earmarking you for pakistan, you know pakistani aid [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5215.54s)]
*  This has clear implications for us statecraft if this gets busted. This is what the cia is why we task the cia to do this [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5219.3s)]
*  plausible liability [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5226.18s)]
*  If something has diplomatic blowback and we don't want us fingerprints on it [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5228.42s)]
*  we need a formal intelligence agency because there's diplomatic blowback if [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5231.54s)]
*  Us fingerprints are revealed. So, uh, no, yeah, uh just discrete. Um [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5235.780000000001s)]
*  Uh, yeah, yeah like discrete. Uh, let's see if you scroll down [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5241.22s)]
*  um [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5245.22s)]
*  That third one might do but if you scroll down [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5246.820000000001s)]
*  Uh, but but but but but but but but but if you you put discrete discrete action [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5249.62s)]
*  It may be put discrete action or discrete covert and action [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5255.06s)]
*  I [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5259.0599999999995s)]
*  Believe there's a huffpoh one on this that's yeah, there you go. Yeah, when is covert action not covert when it's discrete [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5261.94s)]
*  us aids so basically [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5268.9s)]
*  When this and if you scroll down to the bottom of this you'll see if you just control f for the word senate [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5271.0599999999995s)]
*  You'll see [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5276.66s)]
*  last week [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5278.42s)]
*  Elon musk held an x space directly with senator joanie urnst [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5279.7s)]
*  Who has been on this crusade to reform us aid excesses and there's a really scandalous moment there where senator urnst revealed [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5283.78s)]
*  That she was actually threatened by us aid when she tried to get insight into what they were actually doing. Well [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5290.5s)]
*  Um [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5296.9s)]
*  If you actually scored out if you just do the next the next one basically what us aid said is well [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5298.5s)]
*  It's discrete democracy promotion. So it's uh, you know, we don't need a presidential finding for it. Um, [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5302.66s)]
*  Okay, maybe this is not the error [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5309.7s)]
*  But basically if if you control f for the word staff that might help it too, but um [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5311.22s)]
*  Everyone can look this up independently all this uh, okay. Is that the only okay? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5316.740000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's a different article but basically senate staffers and everyone go on youtube [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5321.22s)]
*  This is there was a formal hearing on this to for oversight what happened and what the staffers said is [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5325.3s)]
*  This is the staffers on the senate foreign relations committee, which is supposed to be the thing that reigns in that gives the american people [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5331.46s)]
*  oversight and accountability for us aid gone rogue and [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5337.54s)]
*  What what this what the senate staffers overseeing us aid said is we had no visibility on this entire operation the entire time [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5341.3s)]
*  Because us aid told us if they had to if they had to tell us what we were doing people could die [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5348.26s)]
*  This is classic cia stuff [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5354.26s)]
*  But this the senate was blocked and I should note again when it's too dirty for the cia you give it to us aid [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5356.26s)]
*  This is why these drug operations and these terrorist operations run primarily through us aid rather than directly at the cia [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5361.780000000001s)]
*  The inspector general, um just just two weeks ago put out a report the first time this has been publicly reported [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5369.9400000000005s)]
*  There's been inspector general at us aid practically from the day. It was born. It's supposed to be [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5375.54s)]
*  This is what joni erinst was complaining about senator. Joni erinst was complaining about which was that [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5380.02s)]
*  How how can they get away with this and it's because the inspector general is supposed to hold the agency to account from from the inside [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5384.900000000001s)]
*  But it's an independent agency [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5390.42s)]
*  So there's limited oversight from the outside if you have a rogue inspector general [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5391.700000000001s)]
*  They keep the whole op in house don't need to tell the executive branch don't need to tell the senate congress [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5395.219999999999s)]
*  Run it just like an ollie north iran contra style [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5400.5s)]
*  Self-sustained standalone off the shelf private enterprise to run covert action on taxpayer dime [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5403.679999999999s)]
*  But uh not have it go through the formal approval channels. Well [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5409.62s)]
*  so basically [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5414.0199999999995s)]
*  You know what what they were doing here in um, you know in [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5416.419999999999s)]
*  What the oig report the inspector general report just published and ever the best article on this [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5420.18s)]
*  With the the link to it is john solomon's just the news [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5425.22s)]

*  We're just now learning this [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5433.3s)]
*  two weeks ago [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5435.3s)]
*  Despite them them doing this activity for 30 years. It turns out there's a there's a get out of [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5436.82s)]
*  Get out of sponsoring terrorism free card at us aid, which is that us aid cannot directly provide [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5443.06s)]
*  funding to terrorist groups [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5449.54s)]
*  But their contractors are not required under the grant agreements to go through those [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5452.58s)]
*  You know o fact style those counterterrorism financing if a bank did it you would go directly to jail [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5458.9s)]
*  Uh, do not pass go, uh, you know [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5464.34s)]
*  Do not have liberty again for the next 20 years of your life [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5467.3s)]
*  But if us aid does it it's completely legal right now [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5470.42s)]
*  And so this is how you have us aid giving you know, they just last week 122 million dollars to isis, you know [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5474.419999999999s)]

*  For for d.o.d special operations work as well as for political destabilization work. I'll give a great example [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=5497.46s)]

*  Factions of them just like they're doing today against the mega movement side of the republican party [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6285.56s)]

*  But so they couldn't get a legislative bill to do this. So what they did is they they restructured the [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6293.88s)]
*  The intelligence apparatus the covert action capacities and the way our statecraft is done through us aid [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6300.6s)]

*  The magga movement is fighting the the ghost of of ronald reagan past [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6333.0s)]
*  the the reason republicans loved usaid john bolton types liz cheney types love it is because [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6337.48s)]
*  This was our muscle for us chamber of commerce multinational companies [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6343.799999999999s)]

*  This is the the reaganite sort of reaganomics [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6381.5s)]

*  The problem was is as globalization [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6417.42s)]
*  Kept on kept a pace, you know through the 90s and 2000s [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6420.3s)]

*  They don't hire their labor here anymore they don't have their manufacturing facilities here anymore [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6438.96s)]
*  You know, we're not the primary export market for this [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6443.92s)]
*  So you have u.s state state department and usaid paying to help the corporate welfare of [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6446.56s)]
*  nominally u.s-based companies [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6453.68s)]

*  created effectively in part to [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6854.78s)]
*  Assist pentagon activity under humanitarian front and I talk about this a lot, but I feel that the point is under appreciated [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6858.08s)]
*  So this is sort of a good moment to go over it. Am I talking too much by the way? No, perfect. Okay [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6865.12s)]
*  So everyone, you know they say [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6870.24s)]

*  the new trove of documents and whatnot and trump's eo around uh, you [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6880.48s)]
*  The source of his assassination, but the fact that jfk created [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6885.36s)]
*  um [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6890.16s)]
*  Created us aid by executive order in 1961 and he is [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6891.5199999999995s)]
*  Known and loved as a as a martyred figure regardless of who in the end killed him [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6896.32s)]
*  Um has given us sort of public in in premature [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6900.879999999999s)]
*  on us aid [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6905.04s)]
*  as a or usaid as it used to be called and you know, uh, you know in order to [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6907.44s)]
*  try to [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6912.959999999999s)]
*  Make clear that it was not uh, you know an aid organization, but um now now almost you know [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6914.0s)]
*  even that parlance has dropped off as they need to defend it more and more but [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6920.24s)]
*  So they they think okay, you know jfk martyred deeply beloved figure [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6924.719999999999s)]
*  He created usaid it was sort of about the kindness of his heart. It was a charity, you know [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6928.0s)]
*  this was [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6932.56s)]
*  It was jfk who fundamentally [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6934.16s)]
*  supercharged america's [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6936.78s)]
*  The american military's small wars capacity. This is the the the terminology in the u.s army war college and special forces around [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6939.4400000000005s)]
*  You know sort of not full-scale conventional wars. They're either small small-scale paramilitary [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6947.76s)]
*  skirmishes [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6954.78s)]
*  Or um or insurgency counterinsurgency so it's [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6956.24s)]
*  And the problem was is jfk was was bogged down in vietnam bogged down in laos [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6961.12s)]
*  And the the problems that we were fighting against were not the kind of things that you know [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6967.28s)]
*  You'd have the other political predicate after a lot of the disasters of the career of the korean war in 1950 [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6971.84s)]
*  And uh and the international blowback to having formal dod boats on the grounds [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6977.84s)]
*  What what he believed was was vital and necessary to capacity build and supercharge [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6983.04s)]
*  was a [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6989.759999999999s)]
*  Cove a paramilitary covert capacity for dod in the war fighting space that the ci had had [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6991.2s)]
*  At that point in the political war space [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=6997.5199999999995s)]
*  And this is done through the u.s special forces [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7000.24s)]
*  and through some of its sub branches which are [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7004.4s)]
*  psychological operations civil military affairs [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7008.379999999999s)]
*  We can stick with that, but basically these are civil military is [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7012.799999999999s)]
*  When in order to achieve the military objective [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7017.92s)]
*  Uh the the thing that needs to be done is actually something of the civil layer like for example [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7020.639999999999s)]
*  In order to win the war in [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7026.08s)]
*  Against russia right now nato believes we need to build the single largest military base in all of nato [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7028.24s)]
*  on the black sea coast of romania [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7034.48s)]
*  Uh that points straight out in a line at crimia and move this this base that's under construction is 100 bigger [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7036.879999999999s)]
*  than the biggest current air force nato base in [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7044.16s)]
*  You know in europe the the ramstein base in in germany. We're now moving as we speak [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7048.08s)]
*  There are fighter jets and drones being moved from [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7052.879999999999s)]
*  germany to romania [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7055.759999999999s)]
*  As we are building this base that will be the point of source projection against [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7057.44s)]
*  The the black sea navy of russia against the you know against crimia in order to you know turn the tide [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7062.88s)]
*  well [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7070.719999999999s)]
*  That's a military operation right the the the military the nato military base against the russian forces in crimia [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7072.5599999999995s)]
*  But what is actually the most important strategic objective for the military? It's actually not a military one. It's a civil one [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7080.24s)]
*  See there's an election going on in romania right now [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7087.52s)]
*  You may have you may have heard about this the cancelled election in romania with the georgia skew this right wing populist figure [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7089.68s)]
*  Who has pledged neutrality in the war? [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7095.92s)]
*  He doesn't want to he's no he doesn't want to antagonize america, but he doesn't want to kill the russians [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7098.400000000001s)]
*  He doesn't want he wants to [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7103.12s)]
*  Basically back nato off and he doesn't want to allow this military base to be to be made [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7104.88s)]
*  Well, that is a civil decision [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7109.28s)]
*  by the elected government [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7111.76s)]
*  of romania [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7113.84s)]
*  Decided by the hearts and minds of the voters of the romanian people [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7115.2s)]
*  but that civil action [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7119.92s)]
*  will either [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7122.24s)]
*  in nato's eyes [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7123.76s)]
*  Win the war or lose the war [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7125.76s)]
*  so the problem is is [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7128.0s)]
*  It would kind of be something of a diplomatic incident shall we say if nato rolled in and did [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7130.0s)]
*  You know slobodan milosevic style air you know air striping of uh, you know air strifes against the romanian [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7135.76s)]
*  parliament building and rolled into uh, you know rolled into the capital with tanks and troops just because um, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7143.28s)]
*  You know the president was responding to the damn crack will of the people so you need another mechanism [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7150.72s)]
*  To influence the civil affairs enter civil military. This is where you get us aid in this as well as us aid for psychological operations [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7155.76s)]
*  For example, i've been i've been playing this, you know clip for for months now and showing this, you know [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7164.16s)]
*  us military document from the [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7170.08s)]
*  john f kennedy special warfare, uh, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7172.88s)]
*  Center, I mean the the special forces the psychological operations [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7176.32s)]
*  Um and civil military training and recruiting center at fort brag the center of our psychological operations is called the john f kennedy [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7180.0s)]
*  uh special warfare, uh, you know training center [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7188.0s)]
*  but [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7191.84s)]
*  you know [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7192.72s)]
*  Us aid does that work? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7195.4400000000005s)]
*  So for example, i've been showing a military document from the biden mark milley era published in 2021 [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7196.88s)]
*  About how to plan race riots in africa in order to uh in order to stop the construction [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7203.2s)]
*  Of a uh of a of a port by a foreign government that would allow their force projection into the atlantic ocean [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7209.28s)]
*  In a sample scenario where the u.s. Ambassador [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7215.2s)]
*  Tries to get this west african country on the you know on the atlantic coast there [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7217.92s)]
*  Uh to to cancel the port construction for the in partnership with the foreign government [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7223.04s)]
*  But that government doesn't want to do it and so they refuse the u.s. Ambassador they refuse the state department [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7227.2s)]
*  So this is literally in the planning guide and pitch book for the u.s. Special forces. It's available online right now [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7232.88s)]
*  Everyone can look this up. It's all over my ex x feed. I posted a link a million times and all the screenshots [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7238.72s)]
*  But they show the role of special forces [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7243.6s)]
*  They they're pitching this basically to you know to get more grant funding that [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7246.64s)]
*  That we can help a near-peer competition actually with these with foreign countries by having special forces [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7250.72s)]
*  destabilize the country inflame racial tensions between the africans who work in the factories [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7257.099999999999s)]
*  And the business owners of the foreign government in the local regional development [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7263.36s)]
*  Uh cause mass walkouts and strikes, but if you want to pull this on screen I can you know [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7268.5599999999995s)]
*  If you see you know, I can just show you these two these two things [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7273.679999999999s)]
*  um, if you just go to my x feed [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7276.48s)]
*  and um [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7279.04s)]
*  Uh, you can type in rent rights or you just type in uh, you know, just type in u.s. Aid [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7280.32s)]
*  Job fairs or us aid, you know job [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7286.0s)]
*  and you'll see in this scenario, uh, they [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7289.5199999999995s)]
*  They talk about the interagency coordination between defense diplomacy and development, you know [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7294.32s)]
*  All the the the roles yes, which is us aid job. You can pull it up [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7299.759999999999s)]
*  And what they propose is that as they are inflaming these racial tensions to cause these riots and boycotts of the local businesses [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7305.2s)]
*  that [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7313.599999999999s)]
*  Us aid would play the role of swooping in yeah, go ahead click those and I can show you the source documents and everything [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7314.88s)]
*  It's it's all over [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7320.24s)]
*  um [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7321.4400000000005s)]
*  So iwc for example is information warfare center at fort brag again. They're in west africa [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7322.24s)]
*  This now this is a sample scenario with a hypothetical african country [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7327.12s)]
*  And I don't want to belabor this i'm not trying to cause an international incident by saying this [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7330.16s)]
*  I'm just trying to get the american people insight into why you are going to find us aid fingerprints [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7333.52s)]
*  all over pentagon operations and no one's going to have known about it before because [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7339.2s)]
*  You park it at us aid [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7344.16s)]
*  The military doesn't have to tell the president what they're actually doing [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7346.48s)]
*  This is why for example you had the fight over isis and i'll but we can get to this right after this but you know [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7349.919999999999s)]
*  I'll we'll get to how [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7356.0s)]
*  How the u.s military duped trump through these these things constantly playing shell games with the numbers in syria, for example [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7358.16s)]
*  You'll see, you know what the information warfare center did is [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7364.5599999999995s)]
*  um, you know, they they saw a sign at the at along the road for this port construction [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7367.679999999999s)]
*  And they they say the plan is we need to buy the ambassador more time [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7372.72s)]
*  Because this port is going to be they're going to close on it [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=7377.04s)]

*  A country when you overthrow its government or you pump up your favorite political party to win the election it transitions from democracy [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8075.56s)]
*  from autocracy to democracy [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8084.12s)]
*  Or it transitions from illiberal democracy democracy to genuine democracy [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8086.76s)]
*  It's a turnover of government [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8092.52s)]
*  and uh and we have [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8094.76s)]
*  Doctrine we have a whole field of scholarship at the state department at us aid [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8097.64s)]
*  Uh, and that is carried out in covert ways, uh through civil military dod and at cia called transitional justice, which is [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8101.72s)]
*  weaponizing the justice department and creating the criminal predicate to eliminate your political adversaries you just [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8108.660000000001s)]

*  In order to stop them from ever rising to power again, and i'll show you some great receipts on this so that everyone can see [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8119.4800000000005s)]
*  This with their own eyes [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8125.400000000001s)]
*  Uh, but before I do let me just flesh this out for a second, which is that every regional desk at the state department [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8126.92s)]
*  Or or in the usaid portfolio has to compete every year on for their budget [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8133.16s)]
*  They have to fight for their lives because the people you know, uh who are the regional desks around kyrgyzstan and you know [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8137.56s)]
*  Georgia moldova latvia lithuania [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8146.76s)]
*  They're competing in the budget for what's going to western hemisphere [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8149.64s)]
*  What's going to argentina and brazil and columbia and they're competing against sub-ahead africa [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8153.08s)]
*  So the cheaper it is to manage the political vassalage of a country the better [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8157.4s)]
*  They may have had to to to ask for a lot more money in the budget one off in election year to run that money [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8161.72s)]
*  Through democracy international or through seps or any a number of usaid or ned programs to fund the political party [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8167.88s)]
*  They want they want to win [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8174.44s)]
*  But they can't keep that system [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8176.44s)]
*  They were only given that money because it was a special thing [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8178.68s)]
*  They're not necessarily going to be able to get that the next time around and they'll be able to spend money on other [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8181.0s)]
*  Soft power goals in the region if it's if they don't have to worry about the other party rising again [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8186.4400000000005s)]
*  Or doing what trump just did, you know winning then losing then winning again [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8191.64s)]
*  and so transitional justice is a whole field at state and in the ngoplex to [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8195.800000000001s)]
*  Uh to make it cheap to manage the course of and result of foreign elections [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8202.2s)]
*  By making sure anyone who's a serious challenger to you ends up in jail and i'm just going to show you something because it's now in [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8207.48s)]

*  Elon musk this week [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8213.16s)]
*  You know tweeted out about you know horrible situation where someone from the pis the law and justice party in poland [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8214.92s)]
*  I believe is now facing arrest for clicking the like button on a social media post [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8221.88s)]
*  Jesus and [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8226.2s)]
*  You know what was the post? I don't actually know what the post was. Is it one of coney's? [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8228.2s)]
*  I played the fifth. I don't know but [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8234.36s)]
*  but uh the fact is is [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8236.52s)]
*  You know poland plays and i've been saying this forever and this is maybe too far afield for for the [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8239.560000000001s)]
*  Narrow topic of discussion today, but poland plays an absolutely huge [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8244.36s)]
*  uh [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8247.640000000001s)]
*  Probably the lynchpin role in all of eastern europe with everything that's happening with ukraine because the whole play was to kill russian gas [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8248.76s)]
*  And and then you need an alternative gas supply into europe to offset that and there's only two ways to do that [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8256.12s)]
*  You know one is ukraine builds up its own gas [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8260.92s)]
*  Uh infrastructure and exploits its endogenous [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8263.72s)]
*  Uh, you know hydrocarbon supply which it has a lot of it's the third largest in europe, but it's unexploited [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8267.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, they can't do that right now because russia reconquered that exact territory in eastern ukraine that those sit on the only [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8273.4s)]
*  The other the only way to of the other way to do that is through exporting lng, you know liquefied natural gas [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8279.64s)]
*  From north america, you know from the permean basin or whatnot in houston [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8286.76s)]
*  Freezing it shipping it, you know [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8291.8s)]
*  7 000 miles across the atlantic up through the the baltic straits through these newly compo newly built [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8294.5s)]
*  Uh, you know routing terminals into poland and the terminals there and then routing it there into [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8300.28s)]
*  Slovakia and ukraine and central europe and on from there. So doesn't this bring us back to what mike johnson said that [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8306.1s)]
*  Biden had signed an executive order that he hadn't read [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8313.24s)]
*  About liquid natural gas [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8316.6s)]
*  Yeah, well that's interesting because that has to do also with the economics of of it [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8318.6s)]
*  You know, you don't want too much supply because then the profits of the corporations, you know, they're selling it [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8322.28s)]
*  they're selling it for less margin as the as the supply goes up, but yeah, the lng fight is is [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8326.92s)]
*  is [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8332.52s)]
*  The major one in in the energy space, but it's much more expensive for lng that process liquefaction transport [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8333.720000000001s)]
*  Deliquification transport back is way cheaper than just taking out the ground and putting in a pipeline, you know straight straight to the customer [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8340.9s)]
*  So the european countries don't want to do this they don't they or at least [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8347.32s)]
*  Until they were strong armed and you know what the state department and nato have done is they've selectively [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8351.48s)]
*  bred and financed and politically supported [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8357.48s)]
*  all of the european political parties and candidates who have vowed to basically go go forward with this plan and put their [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8361.24s)]
*  Put their country through an energy diversification policy and buy this expensive lng which is skyrocketed [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8367.72s)]
*  I should know the profits of you know, many of these these western exporters [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8372.76s)]
*  So again, there's an argument. Maybe that's in u.s. Interest [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8376.44s)]
*  If there was that trickle down, but we'll leave that aside [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8380.28s)]
*  But the point is is pulling basically as a veto right on this whole plan [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8382.52s)]
*  Because if if the poll if the poland government says hey, you know what? [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8385.560000000001s)]
*  We don't want to antagonize the russians the russians may actually attack us, you know [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8388.68s)]
*  This is this is provocative because this is in tandem with the plan to cut off gas prom [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8393.16s)]
*  Also, we don't want to become a political vassal state of the u.s. Or the uk or nato [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8397.640000000001s)]
*  And this is what was starting to happen with the law and order, you know [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8402.679999999998s)]
*  You know law and justice pis party in poland and so this whole network the atlantic council network was backing to the full hilt [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8407.16s)]
*  Donald tusk who became the prime minister of poland in i believe december 2023 [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8414.439999999999s)]
*  With that context jamie. Can you pull on screen? I just [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8420.679999999998s)]
*  Reupped these receipts i've been posting this for months, but this is very [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8424.519999999999s)]
*  Everyone should see this with their own eyes [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8428.119999999999s)]
*  Because this gets back to occrp and state-sponsored media to prosecute people this gets back to you know, the role of of the u.s [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8429.8s)]
*  aid [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8437.88s)]
*  Capacity building the networks around prosecutors here in the u.s [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8439.4s)]
*  Um the us aid capacity building the prosecutor networks and we should get to that on brazil, but let's can we start here with poland? [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8443.72s)]
*  There's kind of like bypass the whole music industry. Oh my god. No, wait. We've just we've just started on that. Okay, here's an easy one [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8452.279999999999s)]
*  Look up look at the u.s music diplomacy program [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8460.279999999999s)]
*  So this is the this is but this is all music overseas or music domestically as well [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8463.96s)]
*  Well, that's the issue is because there's this interplay first. So first of all came back to the dualipa. Yeah atlantic council thing. So [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8469.4s)]
*  Again, essentially, you know, she's calling out human rights abuses from you know, these balkan governments [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8475.24s)]
*  uh, you know with a with a family pedigree and popularity in kosovo and other places that are hugely [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8481.64s)]
*  In geo the geopolitical crosshairs right now [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8487.8s)]
*  and so [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8490.6s)]
*  And i'm not saying whether it's good or bad again [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8491.880000000001s)]
*  i'm not even weighing in on you know, the the humanitarian abuses or whatnot what i'm saying is is [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8493.56s)]
*  It's it's music as an instrument of statecraft dualipa is this is the the u.s military the state department u.s [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8499.32s)]
*  aid seven cia directors the barisma networks [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8506.2s)]

*  Tens of millions of social media followers people, you know who or diehard follower concert [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8511.64s)]
*  She's an international superstar and her public support [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=8516.279999999999s)]

*  Basically saying that you know taylor swift has worked in various things before that have been empirically shown to move the needle on government initiatives [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=9208.22s)]

*  We paid for this to be pitched now. Here's where some of the story got misreported [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=9237.92s)]
*  I don't know that anyone from nato [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=9242.96s)]
*  Directly reached out to taylor swift or her campaign to do that [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=9245.6s)]
*  I'd this and if they did this would not be formalized in a formal pentagon grant or quid pro quo [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=9249.439999999999s)]
*  But I should note look at who the biggest sponsor of south by southwest is in in texas now [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=9255.2s)]
*  It's the military go ahead and look up the scandal if you want about uh south by southwest [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=9260.640000000001s)]

*  Um from for the past couple years that I guess they're now they're now [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=9279.84s)]
*  Reforming this but if you if you run a bully and search for before 2024, you'll you'll see this [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=9283.52s)]

*  So, you know, he makes a very compelling case about the role of of the u.s [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11092.32s)]
*  Intelligence community and at the wholesale level in peru and bolivia and at the you know and at the actual processing [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11096.64s)]

*  You know these chicago and and miami and new york ones you have a culture of drug use that creates a market for [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11141.76s)]
*  For selling the proceeds so that drugs can be turned into cash which can then be used to purchase guns [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11150.72s)]

*  Of the of the destabilization. So your argument is essentially that this game plan is ubiquitous [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11210.16s)]
*  And that this game plan is done in the united states too to promote drug use and drug selling [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11216.48s)]
*  Which they profit off of i'm not even going that far. What i'm saying is is there's there's a useful role [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11222.56s)]
*  um around [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11229.44s)]

*  This is the major major [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11242.96s)]
*  scandal [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11244.88s)]
*  The head of the central intelligence agency [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11246.08s)]
*  Uh john deutche had to had to travel to compton in 1997 [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11248.08s)]
*  I believe that was the year in order to plead with the black population there [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11252.24s)]
*  That what had happened with the cis, you know role in in the drug trade was a sort of you know [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11256.88s)]
*  Occasional one-off accident wasn't authorized wasn't supposed to happen [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11262.539999999999s)]
*  Um, but the fact is is those narco networks supported the nicaraguan contra movement. You needed a market to sell it [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11266.32s)]
*  Uh, you know and and those were [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11275.039999999999s)]
*  Those were inner city urban populations in in los angeles that were [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11277.359999999999s)]
*  You know, they weren't the ones growing the cocaine that was grown in in peru and bolivia and then it was processed in colombia [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11282.64s)]
*  And then it was you know, that's all that stuff that michael rupert exposed [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11287.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's been there's been a million and it's everywhere you look and it's not just south and and then again [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11291.28s)]

*  This stuff is all [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11298.08s)]
*  To me just interesting. I don't have a hard opinion on it [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11299.6s)]
*  I I uh, I almost don't want to [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11303.36s)]

*  But what i'm saying is is you are going to see resistance from very strange pockets as you do this distinct entangling process [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11312.0s)]

*  It should be very concerning in mainstream media [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11893.72s)]
*  Complete absence the the all the dis all the discussion [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11897.8s)]
*  The negative anti-trump discussion about us aid shutting down is all the good that it does [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11902.76s)]
*  And then also you're going to get access to people's private data. That's all you're hearing [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11909.24s)]
*  You're hearing the the gaslighting spin is those two things [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11914.84s)]
*  Right, but every single one of those people need to understand the category [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11919.16s)]
*  They talk about public health and all the lives and how many more people are going to have [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11922.44s)]
*  You know aids and hiv in 2014 us aid was busted running a covert operation where according to their own [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11925.96s)]
*  You know, uh, you know people who are involved in the operation they set up an hiv [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11933.08s)]
*  prevention program [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11937.8s)]
*  In foreign countries in order because it would be the perfect excuse because counterintelligence would never think [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11939.72s)]
*  That that the hiv clinics were that were the place that they were using as you know as key nodes and the regime change network [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11945.0s)]
*  How many other facilities they were caught there? [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11951.4s)]
*  How many others but in every single one of those it's dual purpose because the fundamental reason you do this out of us aid [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11953.32s)]
*  Is to dupe people [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11959.48s)]
*  And this puts this puts our oversight bodies in a difficult spot [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11962.199999999999s)]
*  let's just say we're funding transgender dance festivals and in some country because [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11966.52s)]
*  Uh turns out they uh, they really dislike a government that we consider authoritarian [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11971.64s)]
*  and so you could actually see a sort of [[03:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11976.84s)]
*  I don't know the situation in venezuela, but let's just say that the trump administration has been at war with maduro and [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11979.0s)]
*  uh, you know wants to [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11984.6s)]
*  You know pursue a policy of turning over that government and it just so happens that that government is persecuting the transgender population [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11986.2s)]
*  And the transgender population if they could just be built up more, you know would be able to convert, you know [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=11994.36s)]
*  Convert more hearts and minds to vote against maduro. Well, you could see a sort of [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12000.12s)]
*  If I may say [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12005.0s)]
*  Again, i'm not saying this should be done. I'm just saying you could see a sort of mega foreign policy [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12006.68s)]
*  uh explanation for funding transgender dance festivals in venezuela if that's what the baseline assessment reveals the problem is is [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12011.56s)]
*  American people are never going to be allowed to know about it because imagine the senate oversight committee [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12019.800000000001s)]
*  Why are we funding these transgender dance festivals in venezuela? [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12023.720000000001s)]
*  Oh actually because we're running a uh a lie there by the way everyone in venezuela can watch this live hearing [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12026.84s)]
*  Uh, the whole thing is actually a carefully constructed lie because we're cynically exploiting the transgender people [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12033.0s)]
*  To serve as battering rams against the the head of state we want to overthrow, but we've not declared that publicly. I mean [[03:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12038.04s)]
*  you [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12045.64s)]
*  We're back to plausible deniability [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12046.68s)]
*  This is a lot [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12053.32s)]
*  I think it's probably good to end right here. Okay, but uh, thank you mike [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12054.6s)]
*  Thank you for everything thanks for being you like I don't think a lot of people would chase this down like this [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12058.68s)]
*  And I know this is a lot of weight. It's a quite a burden that you're carrying [[03:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12064.52s)]
*  But uh, I mean, I think you're being vindicated in like a scale that i've never seen before. It's pretty it's pretty impressive [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12069.080000000002s)]
*  And all the stuff that you were talking about before all these documents were exposed before they doge went into usa [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12076.76s)]
*  You were dead right about all of it [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12082.52s)]
*  Thank you and again [[03:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12084.44s)]
*  I don't want to get you in trouble with with this stuff [[03:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12086.04s)]
*  you know some of the topics that we talked about like the the drug stuff and the [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12087.960000000001s)]
*  Rap stuff and the you know, some of the the terrorism stuff is is not my primary focus [[03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12092.28s)]
*  I'm not making hard facial claims there. I don't care about the taylor swift thing. It's frankly it's it's just [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12097.560000000001s)]
*  Fascinating that you would see that on a native like this is [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12103.7s)]
*  What I care about is you know what we talked about with its control over media. It's control over prosecutors [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12107.560000000001s)]
*  It's control over social media and pushing, you know social media censorship and these sorts of things that [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12112.68s)]
*  You know that we have a once in a lifetime chance to reform and I want to thank you and express my personal gratitude [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12117.880000000001s)]
*  um for for having these [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12124.12s)]
*  Difficult and i'm sure taxing conversations to crack it all open my pleasure. Thank you. All right. Bye everybody [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12126.28s)]
*  You [[03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg&t=12142.52s)]
