# Joe Rogan Experience #2084 - Jim Breuer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6.0s)]
*  Jim Brewer. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10.0s)]
*  What's up baby, how are you? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=12.0s)]
*  It's good to see you man. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=14.0s)]
*  Good to see you too my friend. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=16.0s)]
*  You look all happy and refreshed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=18.0s)]
*  Well I was on vacation. Yeah, so I went to the British Virgin Islands for 10 days. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=20.0s)]
*  Just chilled, went to the beach, did some fishing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=24.0s)]
*  Wonderful time, just relaxing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=27.0s)]
*  Just relaxing. Did you scuba? Wonderful. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=29.0s)]
*  Do some little snorkeling, did some snorkeling. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=31.0s)]
*  Scuba kind of freaks me out. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=33.0s)]
*  I would do it, but the idea of relying on that tank of air, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=35.0s)]
*  and you're breathing underwater, and you slowly have to make your way to the surface. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=39.0s)]
*  Fuuuck! [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=43.0s)]
*  What if something goes sideways? How long can you hold your breath? Jesus! [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=45.0s)]
*  You don't go down that far. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=49.0s)]
*  I think, I'm shocked you don't like scuba diving. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=51.0s)]
*  It's not whether or not I would like it. I would absolutely love it, I'm sure. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=55.0s)]
*  It's a whole different, everybody I know that's done it loves it. It's a whole world. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=59.0s)]
*  See I'm more freaked out by what you do. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=63.0s)]
*  You go snorkeling, and you smack in your feet on the water. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=65.0s)]
*  I think sharks, oh my god he's fucking struggling. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=69.0s)]
*  I'm going to get him. That freaks me out more. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=73.0s)]
*  Totally possible. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=77.0s)]
*  And happened at a resort where Duncan was staying. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=79.0s)]
*  Was it the week before Duncan was there, or the week after he left? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=83.0s)]
*  I forget which one it was. But in Maui, this lady got eaten by a tiger shark. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=87.0s)]
*  Right out where Duncan was swimming. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=91.0s)]
*  He was out there at the same resort, swimming in the water. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=93.0s)]
*  And during the same time frame, somebody got got. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=97.0s)]
*  They're everywhere. But, yeah no. I'm not a snorkeling fan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=101.0s)]
*  I believe a woman just got killed recently, or a person got killed recently in Maui. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=107.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=112.0s)]
*  Last week a surfer did. But also the week before, well that's just 22. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=114.0s)]
*  Bro, they're out there. Imagine if every year people got killed by werewolves. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=118.0s)]
*  Would you ever go to the woods? When it was a full moon? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=122.0s)]
*  No. Especially at night time. During the day I would. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=126.0s)]
*  I would go. During the day. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=130.0s)]
*  During the day I'm not worried. I feel like werewolves ain't going to mess with you during the day. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=132.0s)]
*  Yeah they'll mess with you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=136.0s)]
*  You think so? Yeah they'll follow you until it gets dark. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=138.0s)]
*  Wouldn't they be more excited to freak you out? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=140.0s)]
*  It depends on what kind of a werewolf it is. If it's a dude who knows he's a werewolf and kind of enjoys it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=144.0s)]
*  That guy would pick people to turn in front of. Like come over to your house. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=150.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=154.0s)]
*  We always assume that the werewolf is this good guy and he gets bit and he's like, shit I can't believe this. No! [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=156.0s)]
*  And then he turns into this monster. But what if he's a piece of shit? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=162.0s)]
*  He knows he's going to be a werewolf and so he wants to make it easy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=166.0s)]
*  So he just becomes your friend and hangs out with you in the house until the moon turns full. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=170.0s)]
*  So this way he's got you in a closed environment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=174.0s)]
*  That's true and then he can start harvesting your whole damn family. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=176.0s)]
*  Yeah it's easy picking. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=179.0s)]
*  Where he brings you all in one at a time. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=181.0s)]
*  Yeah your family live here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=183.0s)]
*  He's already fucking scouted the house for silver bullets. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=184.0s)]
*  There's no silver bullets in this house. I'm good. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=187.0s)]
*  That's cynical. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=191.0s)]
*  But that's a werewolf. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=192.0s)]
*  Well that's human beings too right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=193.0s)]
*  Think about someone's decision. If someone makes a decision to go to war. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=195.0s)]
*  If someone makes a decision to go and think about it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=199.0s)]
*  They use propaganda. They'll use a false flag. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=202.0s)]
*  They'll use misinformation, control of the media and get a war going that isn't really necessary. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=206.0s)]
*  And how many people die from that? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=212.0s)]
*  So they just make this decision. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=215.0s)]
*  They make this decision knowing that a bunch of people are going to die that could be avoided. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=217.0s)]
*  But if they do do it it's going to be very profitable. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=221.0s)]
*  And you can justify doing it. And so they do it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=224.0s)]
*  That's werewolf shit right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=227.0s)]
*  That is werewolf shit. You know what? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=229.0s)]
*  That is werewolf shit. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=231.0s)]
*  Yeah that's the evil werewolf shit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=233.0s)]
*  That's the conniving manipulative all knowing exactly what they're doing werewolf. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=235.0s)]
*  That stuff. Now listen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=241.0s)]
*  I think about that a lot. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=243.0s)]
*  I do think about that a lot. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=247.0s)]
*  I do think about that a lot. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=249.0s)]
*  And I go that is the purest form of evil. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=251.0s)]
*  It's almost like when we were in school. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=254.0s)]
*  When we were messing around in school. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=256.0s)]
*  But on a whole fucked up level. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=258.0s)]
*  When we were messing around in school and you want two people to fight. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=260.0s)]
*  You can easily get...dude a guy called your mother whore. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=263.0s)]
*  Yeah easy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=267.0s)]
*  So you move stupid. And then you get these two to fight. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=269.0s)]
*  These guys are doing it on a fucked up level. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=271.0s)]
*  But here's what's weirder. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=274.0s)]
*  Even though you tell people that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=276.0s)]
*  And you explain that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=278.0s)]
*  They still won't react to it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=280.0s)]
*  But they'll react to like we got the gun law. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=283.0s)]
*  And you know what? My body is my choice. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=287.0s)]
*  They'll lose their mind like that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=291.0s)]
*  Which I'm not debating. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=293.0s)]
*  But it's amazing how much energy. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=296.0s)]
*  And how much planning will go into that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=299.0s)]
*  But when you realize werewolves. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=303.0s)]
*  I like the term werewolf. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=306.0s)]
*  Werewolves that sit and plot and think out how they're going to murder. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=308.0s)]
*  And not only murder. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=313.0s)]
*  But then like steal. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=316.0s)]
*  Steal the resources. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=318.0s)]
*  Steal and then take over and demonize. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=320.0s)]
*  And put little puppet dictators. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=323.0s)]
*  These guys deserved it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=325.0s)]
*  Look at them. They wear their sheets. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=327.0s)]
*  They're called democratically elected officials. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=329.0s)]
*  And they replace them with dictators that they support. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=333.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=336.0s)]
*  Dude, you know what? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=337.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=339.0s)]
*  This freaked me out. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=340.0s)]
*  This freaked me out a little bit. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=341.0s)]
*  So. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=343.0s)]
*  I used to do this bit with fucking Muammar Gaddafi. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=346.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=350.0s)]
*  Muammar Gaddafi. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=351.0s)]
*  And it was true. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=352.0s)]
*  It did this fake bomb thing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=353.0s)]
*  And everyone always say. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=355.0s)]
*  Ah Muammar Gaddafi. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=356.0s)]
*  And then. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=357.0s)]
*  I found out. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=358.0s)]
*  Because you remember growing up that whole thing with Libya. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=362.0s)]
*  You were like. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=363.0s)]
*  Muammar Gaddafi. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=364.0s)]
*  He's a werewolf. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=366.0s)]
*  We got to kill him. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=369.0s)]
*  He shot six missiles. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=371.0s)]
*  At a US plane. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=373.0s)]
*  And we fucking bombed him. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=375.0s)]
*  And then Clinton came in. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=377.0s)]
*  Killed him. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=379.0s)]
*  Took him out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=380.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=381.0s)]
*  Well it was during the Obama administration. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=382.0s)]
*  Wasn't it? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=385.0s)]
*  That he got killed? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=386.0s)]
*  I believe it was when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State that they overthrew Libya. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=387.0s)]
*  Is that the case? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=392.0s)]

*  Right. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=419.0s)]

*  We're talking about a lot of things going on in America. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=482.0s)]
*  But one of the things we hit is Libya. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=484.0s)]
*  Muammar Gaddafi. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=487.0s)]
*  What did you think of Muammar Gaddafi. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=488.0s)]
*  And all of them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=490.0s)]
*  They were like oh great African great African great African. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=492.0s)]
*  I'm like really. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=495.0s)]
*  Well we were told he was like this monster this terrorist. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=497.0s)]
*  Like we. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=500.0s)]
*  We bombed him. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=501.0s)]
*  We were like cheering that we bombed him. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=502.0s)]
*  And they were. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=505.0s)]
*  I said why were they. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=506.0s)]
*  Why was he so good. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=507.0s)]
*  He goes he's good to all the Africans. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=508.0s)]
*  He gave us. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=511.0s)]
*  He gave us education. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=512.0s)]
*  He gave us water. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=513.0s)]
*  He gave us all our needs and if we couldn't get it here and we went somewhere else we [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=515.0s)]
*  do it for him. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=519.0s)]
*  He was. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=520.0s)]
*  He's very good for Africa. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=521.0s)]
*  I said what happened since he left. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=523.0s)]
*  On my kids lives. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=527.0s)]
*  This guy goes. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=529.0s)]
*  Libya. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=531.0s)]
*  Worst sex trafficking. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=532.0s)]
*  The worst sex trafficking. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=534.0s)]
*  So that fucked me. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=537.0s)]
*  Now think about that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=538.0s)]
*  We demonize this place. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=540.0s)]
*  And we were told one thing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=544.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that's not what it was. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=546.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is like what really happened. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=548.0s)]
*  Well the first of all the state collapsed. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=550.0s)]
*  And when the state collapses criminals take over. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=552.0s)]
*  And one of the things you saw in Libya at one point in time. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=555.0s)]
*  Although I did get some messages through a friend of mine that some Libyan people wanted [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=558.0s)]
*  me to know that Libya like the cities in Libya have recovered. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=563.0s)]
*  They're not like as crazy as they were. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=568.0s)]
*  You know that might be national pride that they're saying this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=571.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=574.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=575.0s)]
*  I don't know what the story is. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=576.0s)]
*  Maybe they're much better. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=577.0s)]
*  Maybe they're judging it on a scale or whatever it was. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=578.0s)]
*  But there's there was YouTube videos of open air slavery. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=580.0s)]
*  So you'd watch people bid on people and you'd watch it on YouTube. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=584.0s)]
*  And that was in Libya. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=588.0s)]
*  That was after they killed Gaddafi. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=589.0s)]
*  Did you ever see the video footage of them killing him? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=591.0s)]
*  No. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=594.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=595.0s)]
*  Oh you have to see it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=596.0s)]
*  When the rebels grab hold of Gaddafi and they realize they have him. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=597.0s)]
*  And he realizes that they have him. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=602.0s)]
*  And there's high resolution cameras now because this was like 2012 I believe. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=604.0s)]
*  Someone it was. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=609.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=610.0s)]
*  Somewhere around then. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=611.0s)]
*  2011. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=612.0s)]
*  You know you could get like high resolution cameras. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=613.0s)]
*  And so they're filming this guy who was a dictator for years and they finally have captured him. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=616.0s)]
*  And who knows who's funding them. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=622.0s)]
*  How do they get the money? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=624.0s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=625.0s)]
*  How do they get the guns? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=626.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=627.0s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what the conflict is. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=628.0s)]
*  But I'm just saying the video of him getting killed is fucking terrifying. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=629.0s)]
*  Because there's a look in his face where he knows there's no way out of this. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=634.0s)]
*  He's trying to figure out a way out of this. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=638.0s)]
*  He knows there's no way out of this. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=640.0s)]
*  And one guy takes a bayonet like a big long knife and shoves it up his ass. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=641.0s)]
*  Just shoves it right up his ass while he's standing there. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=646.0s)]
*  And he barely reacts. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=651.0s)]
*  He barely reacts. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=652.0s)]
*  He's in such shock that he barely reacts to a knife getting shoved up his ass. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=654.0s)]
*  Dude I remember one time you said you would talk about chimpanzees. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=658.0s)]
*  Like we're just it was really funny but you go dude we're just chimpanzees that learn how to lie. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=664.0s)]
*  We're chimpanzees that learn how to talk and lie. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=670.0s)]
*  You said something like that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=672.0s)]
*  It was really fucking funny. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=674.0s)]
*  I said they learn how to talk and lie? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=676.0s)]
*  No like we're chimpanzees. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=678.0s)]
*  Who learned how to talk and lie. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=680.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=682.0s)]
*  Now I could be but the point of that was it really makes it because we think we're so far advanced. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=683.0s)]
*  We're much smarter than anything. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=692.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=694.0s)]
*  We're so much better. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=695.0s)]
*  We're better beings. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=696.0s)]
*  We're better souls. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=697.0s)]
*  We are. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=699.0s)]
*  We are. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=700.0s)]
*  We really are. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=701.0s)]
*  We have the capability. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=702.0s)]
*  No we really are. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=703.0s)]
*  We're way better than chimps. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=704.0s)]
*  Listen man if chimps had nuclear weapons it would have been over a long time ago. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=705.0s)]
*  No you're fair enough. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=710.0s)]
*  They would have thought about the future. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=711.0s)]
*  Fuck the future. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=714.0s)]
*  Let's nuke these cunts. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=716.0s)]
*  They would have just nuked everybody. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=717.0s)]
*  Chimps are so ruthless. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=719.0s)]
*  They're so ruthless man. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=721.0s)]
*  They don't give a fuck about you. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=723.0s)]
*  They have no bad feelings. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=725.0s)]
*  They don't have any like remorse for fucking people up. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=726.0s)]
*  They would be the worst. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=729.0s)]
*  But. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=731.0s)]
*  We're way way way way better. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=732.0s)]
*  We're just not good enough yet. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=733.0s)]
*  But you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=735.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=736.0s)]
*  I was just going to say that we're way better than we used to be. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=737.0s)]
*  We're way better than cave people. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=739.0s)]
*  We're way better than people from the 70s. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=741.0s)]
*  And we have to embrace the fact that like we're getting better at life. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=743.0s)]
*  That human beings are getting better at all these things. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=747.0s)]
*  It's just hard. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=750.0s)]
*  And the amount of chaos that's going on constantly now is like unprecedented. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=751.0s)]
*  Because you don't know what the fuck is true or not. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=756.0s)]
*  We're somehow or another you and I Jim Brewer and Joe Rogan two guys who've known each other. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=759.0s)]
*  We're friends for 35 years. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=764.0s)]
*  Somehow or another we have an investment in some fucking war that's happening in Russia and Ukraine. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=765.0s)]
*  We have to have a we have to have a side. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=771.0s)]
*  We have to pick. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=773.0s)]
*  We have to figure out what's true and what's not. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=774.0s)]
*  We have to wade through all the how much money we have to go. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=776.0s)]
*  What's how much money? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=779.0s)]
*  How much money? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=780.0s)]
*  There's no way that you know where all that money's going. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=781.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=786.0s)]
*  Well, neither is it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=787.0s)]
*  How crazy do you have to be at this point in your life? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=788.0s)]
*  Like is there anyone walking down the street going we really, really got to fucking stop Russia from killing you. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=794.0s)]
*  We got to like who the fuck is still thinking that way? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=803.0s)]
*  It's mind boggling to me. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=807.0s)]
*  Well, we we can't be the policemen of the world, but we should do what we can to stop people that are doing something that's horrific. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=809.0s)]
*  But we also shouldn't be involved in things that are violating agreements where we're like pushing arms closer and closer to Russia's border. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=816.0s)]
*  Like all these things are true. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=824.0s)]
*  So it's like all these things are true simultaneously and everybody wants only one side to be true. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=826.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's all they want. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=832.0s)]
*  They want their position to be correct. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=833.0s)]
*  And it's not no. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=835.0s)]
*  No, that's not that Russia thing is messy. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=836.0s)]
*  Of course, it's horrible that Russia attacked Ukraine. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=840.0s)]
*  But also it's kind of fucked that NATO kept fucking with these guys and trying to bring them in and moving arms closer to Russia. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=843.0s)]
*  Hey, man, I get you guys are got you toys and stuff. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=851.0s)]
*  Just do me a favor. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=855.0s)]
*  Let's have an agreement. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=856.0s)]
*  Don't go past here. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=858.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=859.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=860.0s)]
*  Promise? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=861.0s)]
*  We'll shake on it. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=862.0s)]
*  We'll shake on it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=863.0s)]
*  You want to sign? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=864.0s)]
*  Let's sign. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=865.0s)]
*  And then a month later, they're like, dude, why are you moving the fit? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=866.0s)]
*  Don't we greed? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=870.0s)]
*  Werewolves. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=871.0s)]
*  Werewolves. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=872.0s)]
*  Werewolves. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=873.0s)]
*  Werewolves. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=874.0s)]
*  Now, you just said we're not that far off from monkeys. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=875.0s)]
*  And then 10 minutes before that, you talked about the guy shoving a fucking dude that's [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=878.0s)]
*  born baric. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=883.0s)]
*  Chimps would have been way worse. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=884.0s)]
*  Chimps would have gone fingers first. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=886.0s)]
*  Just start chopping off fingers. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=888.0s)]
*  They would have bit his dick off. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=890.0s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=892.0s)]
*  Chimps would have been more worse. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=893.0s)]
*  The knife up the asshole is probably the best way for that guy to go. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=895.0s)]
*  Well, I think we're still way better than what we used to be. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=900.0s)]
*  We're way better than lower primates. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=904.0s)]
*  But I think is we're in the process of reaching another level. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=906.0s)]
*  And I think it's very messy and very complicated. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=910.0s)]
*  And that's where all this AI comes in. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=913.0s)]
*  And that's where the internet comes in. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=915.0s)]
*  That's where social media comes in. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=917.0s)]
*  That's where all this outrage culture comes in. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=918.0s)]
*  It comes in from an unprecedented amount of opinions. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=920.0s)]
*  There's so much that's fucking up the noise from the actual data. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=923.0s)]
*  Because there's so many human beings that can talk simultaneously now. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=928.0s)]
*  And the ones who want to talk the most generally are the fucking dumbest. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=932.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=936.0s)]
*  They're the ones that have the time to be spewing shit out on social media all day. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=938.0s)]
*  Because they're distracting themselves from whatever they really should be doing with their life. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=942.0s)]
*  It's a psychological thing. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=946.0s)]
*  The type of person that gets completely addicted to arguing with people on Twitter all day. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=949.0s)]
*  That person is for sure distracting themselves from something they should have been doing. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=954.0s)]
*  And you're arguing against something you have. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=959.0s)]
*  You don't even know who they are. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=961.0s)]
*  You don't know how old they are. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=962.0s)]
*  You don't know how they're dressed. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=964.0s)]
*  So many of them. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=966.0s)]
*  And they're the primary users of these angry, aggressive social media platforms. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=967.0s)]
*  And so you get a distorted perception of what's happening with human beings. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=974.0s)]
*  But it's colliding with people that are pushing back against that. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=978.0s)]
*  It's colliding with people that are opening their eyes to the amount of corruption, the amount of bullshit, the amount of lies you're being told. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=982.0s)]
*  The amount of money that's being made by these fucking people that are supposed to be making $170,000 a year. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=991.0s)]
*  It's just slavery. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=997.0s)]
*  It's different forms of slavery. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=999.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's... [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1001.0s)]
*  It's control. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1002.0s)]
*  In my opinion. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1003.0s)]
*  It's control. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1004.0s)]
*  It's control. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1005.0s)]
*  It's human beings controlling human beings. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1006.0s)]
*  And they can do it by tricking you. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1008.0s)]
*  And they can trick you into thinking they're with you, they're with trans kids, and they're woke, and they're this and that. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1010.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, they're werewolves. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1015.0s)]
*  That's a trick to get you to come fucking hang out in the cafeteria until the moon comes up. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1018.0s)]
*  That's what that is. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1024.0s)]
*  In the movies, where do they do the werewolves? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1025.0s)]
*  In the movies. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1028.0s)]
*  How do we get rid of werewolves, though? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1029.0s)]
*  They shoot them with silver bullets. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1031.0s)]
*  Except American Werewolf in London, I think they just use regular bullets, which makes more sense. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1032.0s)]
*  Because why should you need a silver bullet? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1036.0s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1038.0s)]
*  Yeah, we don't need some. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1039.0s)]
*  But we've clarified they are werewolves. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1040.0s)]
*  There's a kind of thing that's different than you. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1043.0s)]
*  If you're an architect and you're listening to this, you really love NPR, and you drive an electric car. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1046.0s)]
*  I bet you're a good guy. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1052.0s)]
*  You probably have low T. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1053.0s)]
*  But they can fix that now. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1054.0s)]
*  If you're listening to this, you could imagine a type of a person that exists at the same time that you do that's capable of being such a sociopath that they will just lie to the world in a well-formed out manner that they know is going to cause a war, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1056.0s)]
*  that they know is going to let public support be behind because they've been lied to behind a military campaign that's going to result in untold hundreds of thousands of deaths, possibly like Iraq. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1076.0s)]
*  So we know that wasn't that long ago. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1089.0s)]
*  We know that they lied about weapons of mass destruction. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1092.0s)]
*  They talked about it incessantly on television. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1096.0s)]
*  They lied and got everyone's support behind Iraq. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1099.0s)]
*  Which didn't even make any sense. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1104.0s)]
*  Zero cents. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1106.0s)]
*  It made zero cents. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1107.0s)]
*  But we were so riled up. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1109.0s)]
*  We were like a dog that someone's been fucking throwing rocks at the dog, and then they open the gate and another kid gets bit because he just happened to be there. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1110.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's also a guy in the corner like, oh my God, did you see what happened? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1120.0s)]
*  What the fuck happened? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1124.0s)]
*  What the fuck happened? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1126.0s)]
*  And if you just question, like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, why are we going, what are you talking about? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1127.0s)]
*  You're not American. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1132.0s)]
*  You don't want to fight the terrorists. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1133.0s)]
*  And he made the move. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1134.0s)]
*  That's where Bush came in. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1136.0s)]
*  He was like, make sure you let the world know how powerful we really are, George. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1138.0s)]
*  How did you become a... [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1143.0s)]
*  And you let them know that this is the beginning. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1144.0s)]
*  You don't trust the new world order, and we shall declare war now. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1147.0s)]
*  And he went, you're either with us or you're with them. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1152.0s)]
*  And what he was really saying, now, either with the werewolves or the non werewolves. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1156.0s)]
*  Get Mu'maq Addafi. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1163.0s)]
*  You want to be on this team? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1164.0s)]
*  Shut that shit in his ass. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1165.0s)]
*  Is this what you want? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1167.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1168.0s)]
*  Dude. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1169.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1170.0s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1171.0s)]
*  They had us back then. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1173.0s)]
*  That was mission accomplished. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1174.0s)]
*  That was when they thought they won. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1175.0s)]
*  You're the with us. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1176.0s)]
*  And we kept going on for like 10 more years. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1177.0s)]
*  You're the with us. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1179.0s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1181.0s)]
*  Oh, you're with them. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1182.0s)]
*  And the problem with that is what 9-11 exposed that was great was that there is real patriotism [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1183.0s)]
*  when things go sideways. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1192.0s)]
*  That people will come together. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1194.0s)]
*  And I swear to God to people that are listening to this, that weren't an adult during that [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1195.0s)]
*  time, I swear to God there was a noticeable more positive change in the way people interacted [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1201.0s)]
*  with people, especially the way people treated cops and firemen. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1206.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1210.0s)]
*  I remember when I was in New York City after 9-11 and these firemen were hanging out with [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1211.0s)]
*  us outside in front of this comedy club. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1216.0s)]
*  And it was like hanging out with stars. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1218.0s)]
*  Like, it was like these are like the local stars on the hockey team or something like [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1222.0s)]
*  that. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1227.0s)]
*  Everybody was like, wow, here's a fireman. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1228.0s)]
*  Like it was totally different, man. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1230.0s)]
*  Firemen were getting laid like crazy. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1231.0s)]
*  They were telling me. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1232.0s)]
*  Women wanted to fuck heroes. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1233.0s)]
*  They wanted to fuck real heroes because those are the people that really did risk their [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1234.0s)]
*  lives going in to save people when fucking buildings collapsed. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1239.0s)]
*  Sire, this is causing the opposite effect that we wanted. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1242.0s)]
*  Two, two, tell me. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1246.0s)]
*  They are uniting. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1248.0s)]
*  They're treating them as heroes. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1249.0s)]
*  Imagine what we're saying. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1251.0s)]
*  They're becoming dangerous with their pride and their patriotism. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1252.0s)]
*  What we're saying worst case scenario. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1255.0s)]
*  Demonize them. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1256.0s)]
*  What we're saying worst case scenario is that they not only knew that those planes are going [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1257.0s)]
*  to hit the towers, but that they planned for it. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1263.0s)]
*  And they planned the counterattack. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1266.0s)]
*  And they planned the counterattack. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1267.0s)]
*  And they allowed it to happen. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1268.0s)]
*  That's the scariest of all the conspiracy theories. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1269.0s)]
*  And I'm not saying that that's what happened. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1271.0s)]
*  I think much more likely there's a lot of things that happened that were incompetence. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1273.0s)]
*  I think getting that many people to keep their mouth shut about a plan where planes are going [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1279.0s)]
*  to slam into the World Trade Center. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1284.0s)]
*  Boy, that seems that seems sketchy. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1286.0s)]
*  That seems like people would come out. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1289.0s)]
*  But I think one thing they absolutely do do is when shit goes down, they take advantage of it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1291.0s)]
*  Well, to the point where you just said the media was so powerful. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1297.0s)]
*  Don't forget they were on all cylinders, all cylinders. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1304.0s)]
*  If you question those social media back then, if you write no social media, all you could do is go on. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1308.0s)]
*  I remember being in a pub. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1314.0s)]
*  I was in Chester, New Jersey. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1316.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1318.0s)]
*  Pub. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1319.0s)]
*  What the fuck did that come from? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1320.0s)]
*  I was in a pub. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1323.0s)]
*  Where did that come from? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1325.0s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1326.0s)]
*  So I was in a pub, Chester, New Jersey, and I was talking about the towers. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1327.0s)]
*  And I didn't want to say I didn't believe. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1332.0s)]
*  I said, man, I just got a lot of questions. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1335.0s)]
*  You don't think it was weird? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1337.0s)]
*  They just pancake straight down. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1339.0s)]
*  I thought that was a miracle. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1340.0s)]
*  And then the second one, I'm like, wait a minute. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1342.0s)]
*  Wait. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1344.0s)]
*  And the reaction from that person was, what are you fucking one of those anti-American? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1346.0s)]
*  He wanted to kill me. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1353.0s)]
*  So what I'm saying is you couldn't question anything at that time. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1355.0s)]
*  If you dared question, they immediately have you. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1359.0s)]
*  Even the most popular newscasters that people love today because they're on certain sides, they were selling it hard. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1362.0s)]
*  And to me, I never forgot that. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1372.0s)]
*  They were selling death. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1374.0s)]
*  They were selling murder. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1375.0s)]
*  They were selling war. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1376.0s)]
*  And, bro, you couldn't question anything. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1378.0s)]
*  They had that counterattack ready to go. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1382.0s)]
*  And so when people go, you tell me this was a secret? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1384.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1388.0s)]
*  When you control all that, that's pretty powerful when you want to make violence. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1389.0s)]
*  I questioned it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1394.0s)]
*  This guy wanted to fucking be violent against me. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1395.0s)]
*  And I was just like, I'm just. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1398.0s)]
*  It's crazy to be violent. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1400.0s)]
*  You don't think it's weird? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1401.0s)]
*  It's crazy to be violent about an opinion like that because it's not an offensive opinion. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1402.0s)]
*  It's not an offensive. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1406.0s)]
*  But first of all, it's slightly ignorant, right? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1407.0s)]
*  Because the thing about Tower One and Tower Two specifically is they didn't fall like a controlled demolition at all. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1410.0s)]
*  They fell like a building that was collapsing. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1416.0s)]
*  But Tower Seven fell like a building into its base. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1419.0s)]
*  That one's extraordinary. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1423.0s)]
*  That one's extraordinary. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1425.0s)]
*  And that one absolutely looks like a controlled demolition. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1426.0s)]
*  I am not saying it's a controlled demolition. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1430.0s)]
*  What I am saying is the way it collapsed, it went into its base just like a controlled demolition. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1432.0s)]
*  And if you don't agree with that, then you're talking nonsense. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1439.0s)]
*  If you don't agree with the fact that that looks like a controlled demolition, then we really can't talk because you're dealing in fantasy world. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1444.0s)]
*  Because it undeniably looks exactly like a controlled demolition. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1452.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean it was. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1458.0s)]
*  First of all, one thing that doesn't look like a controlled demolition is the top of it. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1460.0s)]
*  You see it cave in long before the whole building collapses. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1464.0s)]
*  So there was a structural collapse that you can see from the video that most people aren't aware of. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1468.0s)]
*  If you see the top of it before the whole building comes down, see that top? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1474.0s)]
*  See that dark thing in the top? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1478.0s)]
*  That thing goes first. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1480.0s)]
*  Now watch how that goes. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1482.0s)]
*  So, yeah, just play it. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1483.0s)]
*  So what apparently was going on, there's diesel generators in that building. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1485.0s)]
*  See if you could play... [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1490.0s)]
*  I want to see the thing. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1493.0s)]
*  I think it was even before that, Jamie. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1495.0s)]
*  I think it was a larger thing that went under first, that collapsed first. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1497.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1500.0s)]
*  So that's that thing. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1501.0s)]
*  See that? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1502.0s)]
*  Okay, there it goes. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1503.0s)]
*  So that collapses. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1504.0s)]
*  So there's obviously the internal structure's gone. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1505.0s)]
*  So this thing collapsing like that doesn't throw me off as much. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1508.0s)]
*  Having seen that, because I don't know jack shit about construction. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1514.0s)]
*  Who does? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1518.0s)]
*  But I do know that construction companies are shady as fuck upon occasion. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1519.0s)]
*  And if you're supposed to use X, but you can use W, it's going to be fine. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1525.0s)]
*  These fucking structural engineers, they all want extra thick steel. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1533.0s)]
*  We're good with this. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1536.0s)]
*  We've got five rivets instead of six. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1537.0s)]
*  And then you're saving millions and millions of dollars. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1539.0s)]
*  Look, man, I lived in Boston during the time of the Big Dig. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1543.0s)]
*  Do you remember the Big Dig? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1546.0s)]
*  What is the Big Dig? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1547.0s)]
*  The Big Dig was a fucking construction project that was the most corrupt construction project that's ever existed. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1548.0s)]
*  It was supposed to last a couple of years. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1556.0s)]
*  It went on for decades. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1558.0s)]
*  These guys milked it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1559.0s)]
*  They would be working like this. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1560.0s)]
*  It was like New York or Boston. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1562.0s)]
*  The Big Dig, it started in 1982 when I lived there. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1564.0s)]
*  It ended in 2007. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1568.0s)]
*  It was supposed to take like two years. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1570.0s)]
*  They just fucking milked it. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1572.0s)]
*  And a bunch of people went to jail. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1574.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of lawsuits. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1576.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1577.0s)]
*  Fucking full on corruption. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1578.0s)]
*  How come they don't look at the LIE on Long Island? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1580.0s)]
*  It's been under construction since I was a child. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1584.0s)]
*  Forever. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1587.0s)]
*  Forever. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1588.0s)]
*  Well, here's another thing. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1589.0s)]
*  When you pay tolls, the tolls on a bridge were supposed to be to compensate for the money that it took to build the bridge. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1591.0s)]
*  But once they have all the money to build the bridge, they're like, fuck you, pay me. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1600.0s)]
*  Just keep paying me. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1604.0s)]
*  And where's that money going? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1605.0s)]
*  Just keep paying me. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1606.0s)]
*  Well, it goes into the state. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1607.0s)]
*  And then the state can make the government bigger. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1608.0s)]
*  Wee! [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1610.0s)]
*  And we have more people that can go after you if you don't pay. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1611.0s)]
*  Here's another law. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1613.0s)]
*  Pay! [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1614.0s)]
*  Do you know that more government jobs have been created over the last, I forget what the time period was, than any other sector? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1615.0s)]
*  Any other things going on? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1622.0s)]
*  But, Cichot, little things like this, what drives me nuts too is, you know what it is? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1623.0s)]
*  I think people's emotions, it's just people's emotions are still with it. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1629.0s)]
*  They're either in denial or they don't want to face the dark or they picked a team and no matter what that team says, the other team is wrong. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1635.0s)]
*  It's, hey, I'm an Eagles fan. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1644.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, you have to have a lot of looking into things before you form a realistic perspective of what's happening. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1646.0s)]
*  It takes a long time, man. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1655.0s)]
*  And a lot of people don't have that time. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1656.0s)]
*  We're lucky that we're comics and we have a lot of time. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1658.0s)]
*  You know, being a stand-up, especially, you know, the podcast kind of gets in the way of that because I have to sit down and talk to people for a few hours. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1661.0s)]
*  But if you're a stand-up for the most part, you can do whatever the fuck you want during your day. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1667.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1671.0s)]
*  And if you want to freak out, you want to get online and freak out, you want to go full Dave Smith. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1672.0s)]
*  Dave Smith's out there reading studies and papers and fucking historical accounts of false flag events and what was really going on in Nicaragua. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1677.0s)]
*  Like, holy shit, man. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1686.0s)]
*  Like that rabbit hole is filled with werewolves. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1688.0s)]
*  It's a lot of werewolves and werewolves. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1691.0s)]
*  The human past. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1693.0s)]
*  I do this once in a while. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1694.0s)]
*  Once in a while I'll be like, OK, I'm going too deep in there. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1695.0s)]
*  And then I go, oh, I don't have that. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1699.0s)]
*  I don't care about me. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1700.0s)]
*  What am I talking about? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1702.0s)]
*  Of course they care about you. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1703.0s)]
*  You're funny. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1704.0s)]
*  You're funny and you make good points and you're against the narrative. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1705.0s)]
*  You know, but we should all be against the narrative. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1708.0s)]
*  We should figure out what the truth is and forget about the narrative. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1712.0s)]
*  Forget about your ideology. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1714.0s)]
*  You don't have to do it. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1716.0s)]
*  You don't have to do it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1717.0s)]
*  I know everybody thinks they have to do it because you got to be on a team and everybody wants to be on a team is supported by them. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1718.0s)]
*  And it's like we're progressive and we this and we that and we got to stop meat consumption. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1722.0s)]
*  We got to stop and you have all these things that you probably haven't looked at at all and you're married to them because you're committed to this fucking group of people. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1727.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, most people exist here. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1734.0s)]
*  They exist here in this beautiful swamp of both conservative and liberal, conservative on things that are important like taking care of your family and paying your taxes and getting your fucking being on time for work and getting your shit done. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1738.0s)]
*  But but liberal in terms of consideration for all people, whatever your sexual orientation is, whatever you like. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1754.0s)]
*  We're friends. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1761.0s)]
*  We're all just humans. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1762.0s)]
*  I want you to be happy. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1763.0s)]
*  I want everybody to be educated. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1764.0s)]
*  I want everybody to have good health care. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1766.0s)]
*  I want everybody to be in a position where they're not in a place that's filled with crime and murder. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1768.0s)]
*  I want all those things. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1773.0s)]
*  But I know that if you're going to want to have those things now, you got to support law enforcement and you got to train the shit out of them and you got to pay them more. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1774.0s)]
*  You got to make it a more respectable job and then you have to go to the inner cities. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1782.0s)]
*  You can't just allow it to stay the way it is forever. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1785.0s)]
*  You fucking like that's like a national. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1788.0s)]
*  That's a national security problem. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1791.0s)]
*  What is national security? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1794.0s)]
*  The security of the citizens. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1795.0s)]
*  If there's less crime, we're more secure. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1796.0s)]
*  The fact that you're not doing fucking jack shit about that, but you're sending hundreds of billions of dollars to deal with conflict on another part of the world. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1798.0s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1806.0s)]
*  That's insanity. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1808.0s)]
*  And it only works if you get on a team. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1809.0s)]
*  It only works if you support a team. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1812.0s)]
*  There's no reason to be on a team. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1814.0s)]
*  There's no reason to be on a team. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1816.0s)]
*  There's no reason to be on any team. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1817.0s)]
*  No reason. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1820.0s)]
*  No reason. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1821.0s)]
*  There's a way more powerful than that as individuals uniting with this incredible energy. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1822.0s)]
*  Also, you can learn things. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1827.0s)]
*  If you close your fucking head and you don't listen to anything that people on the other side say, you just say, oh, the fucking you're going to miss stuff. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1829.0s)]
*  You're going to miss a lot of stuff. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1837.0s)]
*  You're going to you're going to be wrong. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1838.0s)]
*  You're going to have a stupid egotistical perspective of things that's not necessary. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1839.0s)]
*  You're going to unfairly malign people's character because they have opposing philosophy or an opposing ideology. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1845.0s)]
*  And that's bad for everybody. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1854.0s)]
*  We have to if we're going to move forward as human beings and as a society and as a civilization, we have to be nice to each other. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1856.0s)]
*  We have to just accept the fact that your ideas are not you. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1863.0s)]
*  Do not be married to your ideas and debate them in an open way and talk about stuff in an open way where you're a good person. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1867.0s)]
*  You're talking to other and do it all in good faith. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1876.0s)]
*  And if we can all agree to do that, we'll find out that there's way more we have in common, way more we have in common. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1878.0s)]
*  And that's what we should be concentrating on. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1886.0s)]
*  And there's also some fucking undeniable problems with the way our society is run that have never been addressed in terms of crime and inner city [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1888.0s)]
*  problems and infrastructure. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1896.0s)]
*  There's corruption, at least in the form of incompetence. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1898.0s)]
*  And that's the thing that happens when you get government bigger and bigger and bigger. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1902.0s)]
*  And I hate to sound like a fucking libertarian, but if you get government, it's a business. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1906.0s)]
*  And if it's a business that doesn't have any competition, you can't even hire the public sector to compete and do a better job of all those things. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1911.0s)]
*  All those things have to be taken care of by the government. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1920.0s)]
*  Are we fucking sure? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1923.0s)]
*  Because in every other sector of life, when you allow people to compete, whether it is with art or with, you know, with fucking construction, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1925.0s)]
*  whether it's surgeons, the best ones are the ones that people want to go to. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1936.0s)]
*  And it forces people to get better at everything. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1940.0s)]
*  And you have a much more efficient system. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1943.0s)]
*  I mean, look, imagine if there was businesses out there that they failed their audit six years in a row. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1946.0s)]
*  Right. Money was just missing. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1955.0s)]
*  Sorry, money's missing. Don't know what happened. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1957.0s)]
*  A thousand bucks. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1959.0s)]
*  And we just accept it. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1960.0s)]
*  Hey, you know those guys over at Kellogg's? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1962.0s)]
*  They just, the fucking cereal's everywhere. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1964.0s)]
*  They don't know what's going on. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1966.0s)]
*  Some money's missing here and there. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1967.0s)]
*  Whatever. It's fucking cereal. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1969.0s)]
*  저희가 [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1971.0s)]
*  Our [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1973.5s)]
*  I said, no, I did not have a climate change denier. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1996.64s)]
*  He's an expert in... [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=1999.0s)]
*  A trained word, by the way. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2000.0s)]
*  He's an expert in asteroid impacts and the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, which is the [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2001.0s)]
*  impact theory that ended civilization, allegedly, 11th Earths, you know, the theory is that [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2006.4s)]
*  it did. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2012.32s)]
*  But the point is, like, he was telling me that we've had periods of global warming all [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2013.32s)]
*  throughout the history of the Earth. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2018.68s)]
*  The real fear, he said, is the periods of global cooling. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2020.88s)]
*  He said global cooling should terrify you. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2025.72s)]
*  And he was explaining to me the amount of carbon that is in the atmosphere and that [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2028.96s)]
*  it's a very delicate balance and that when the amount of carbon dips below a certain [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2036.24s)]
*  number, life can't survive. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2041.64s)]
*  Like there's no plant life. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2045.16s)]
*  So the plant life can't survive them and then the animals can't survive. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2046.82s)]
*  And we've gotten close to that in the past without any human intervention. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2050.2s)]
*  We've also gotten close to the point where during the Ice Age, there was so little oxygen [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2053.64s)]
*  on Earth. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2057.52s)]
*  Like the atmosphere was different. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2059.7999999999997s)]
*  It was getting to the point where it was almost like if it got a certain amount colder, it [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2061.04s)]
*  would not be able to support life on the planet. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2065.4s)]
*  But that's the scary one. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2068.56s)]
*  The scary one is the Ice Ages, kids. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2070.08s)]
*  That's the scary one. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2072.64s)]
*  The scary one is not you got to move north. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2073.64s)]
*  The scary one is there is no north to move to because everything's frozen. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2076.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but we're all here on borrowed time. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2081.2400000000002s)]
*  That's true too. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2083.84s)]
*  So who we just say, who's to prevent that? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2084.84s)]
*  If it happened before we existed as humans, it's going to happen no matter what. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2087.76s)]
*  So what are you going to prepare? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2091.6000000000004s)]
*  You spend your whole life preparing for something you don't know it's A, ever going to happen, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2093.2000000000003s)]
*  B, completely out of any human's control. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2097.04s)]
*  There's got to be some steps that you can make. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2101.08s)]
*  So one of the things you could do is I think during the Ice Age, there was parts of the [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2103.1600000000003s)]
*  earth that were not covered in ice. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2108.8s)]
*  And I think it was like all the equator. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2110.76s)]
*  And I think you would probably for human beings to survive, we'd have to go south, which totally [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2113.1200000000003s)]
*  makes sense. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2119.44s)]
*  If you think about the amount of insane stuff that came out of the Amazon, just think about [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2121.0s)]
*  that culture, the Amazon culture and all of the incredible structures that they're finding [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2126.52s)]
*  now deep in the jungle and that there's real evidence that the density of the forest, the [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2131.48s)]
*  amount of trees that are grown that are agriculture trees that are in the forest seems to indicate [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2137.16s)]
*  that that whole thing was manmade. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2141.16s)]
*  There's a type of soil called terra preta. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2143.7999999999997s)]
*  That's this soil that they developed that we don't know how to reproduce. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2147.2799999999997s)]
*  And it's a soil that replicates. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2150.52s)]
*  It's filled with like this biomass. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2152.24s)]
*  And it's like this incredibly rich soil that has like this certain ratio of carbon. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2154.88s)]
*  And they made it. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2159.48s)]
*  These people thousands and thousands of years ago made it. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2160.68s)]
*  And it supports the life of the Amazon. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2163.8399999999997s)]
*  Like that whole fucking place is wild, man. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2166.56s)]
*  I know. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2169.36s)]
*  And that you think about it when everything was frozen up here. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2170.36s)]
*  Like there was a fucking mile high sheet of ice over most of North America up until like [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2174.04s)]
*  10,000, 11,000 years ago. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2179.48s)]
*  So when all that stuff was like that down there, they were chilling down there. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2181.82s)]
*  They didn't have that problem. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2186.96s)]
*  There was like regular temperature for them. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2188.64s)]
*  What we are is like Antarctica is right now. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2190.44s)]
*  That's how we were at one point in time right here. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2192.88s)]
*  Well, I can't go that far back. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2195.96s)]
*  Anything I can't truly imagine, I start to go there and I'm like dinosaurs and all that [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2202.68s)]
*  stuff. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2208.52s)]
*  Yeah, $40 million. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2209.52s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2211.56s)]
*  This bugged me out. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2212.56s)]
*  And I started seeing how they did the World Fair. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2213.92s)]
*  How they just build the whole damn thing up. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2217.32s)]
*  Yeah, and they tore it down. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2219.6s)]
*  Now, in a very small concept. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2220.6s)]
*  I was sitting in this development that I live in now. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2223.2799999999997s)]
*  And I'm sitting and I'm looking because everyone said, oh, dude, we used to hunt down here [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2225.64s)]
*  and bring our four wheelers and blah, blah, blah. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2229.7999999999997s)]
*  And then I started just realizing this entire community, there's like a thousand houses, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2232.3199999999997s)]
*  the palm trees and the grass and blah, blah, blah. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2238.56s)]
*  And it was all just created like a movie set. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2241.52s)]
*  Just completely created. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2246.8799999999997s)]
*  And as crazy as, you know, and there's armadillos. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2247.8799999999997s)]
*  As crazy as that sounds, they're like, oh, so what? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2250.92s)]
*  I always go, well, if you can do that, why couldn't you do it 10 to a thousand times [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2254.1600000000003s)]
*  bigger and how long have you been doing that? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2261.36s)]
*  How long? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2263.44s)]
*  Dude, it started. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2264.44s)]
*  And I'm just sitting on a bench. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2265.44s)]
*  I was going far out there. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2267.04s)]
*  But yeah, it's simple if you really think about it. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2268.7200000000003s)]
*  That's the people who want to eliminate half the population, thinking. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2271.08s)]
*  They're thinking there's too many people. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2273.96s)]
*  Werewolves? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2276.1600000000003s)]
*  The werewolves. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2277.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of people that are, they're elitist as well. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2278.1600000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of elitists that have this perspective that we need to lessen the population, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2280.08s)]
*  including like brilliant people like that woman, the woman who works with the apes. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2285.68s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2292.16s)]
*  What is her name? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2293.16s)]
*  The one that was in Chimps. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2295.4s)]
*  She's amazing. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2296.4s)]
*  What is her name, man? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2297.4s)]
*  She had a great document. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2298.4s)]
*  Jane. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2299.4s)]
*  Jane Goodall. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2300.4s)]
*  Jane Goodall. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2301.4s)]
*  She had a great documentary. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2302.4s)]
*  And then I heard her say she brought up the population control. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2303.72s)]
*  Less people. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2308.52s)]
*  I think that's unfortunate. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2310.44s)]
*  But I think also she's saying that because she lives with monkeys. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2311.52s)]
*  She's out of her fucking mind. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2314.16s)]
*  Like this lady's lived with chimpanzees all day. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2315.4s)]
*  Also, as brilliant and as amazing as this woman is, she also believes in Bigfoot. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2317.6s)]
*  And she's convinced that it exists. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2322.24s)]
*  Come on. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2324.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, play that. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2325.08s)]
*  Play that clip. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2326.08s)]
*  Come on. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2327.08s)]
*  Is this saying that she had quotes that were mistaken? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2328.08s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2329.08s)]
*  I was just checking. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2330.08s)]
*  Well, she said without any suffering. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2331.08s)]
*  She said in a very kind way to reduce the world population. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2333.12s)]
*  I heard her say that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2336.24s)]
*  In context, this misrepresents Goodall's remarks and is not a real quote. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2338.96s)]
*  While she did say many of the world's environmental problems would be relieved if the population [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2342.2400000000002s)]
*  was that of 500 years ago, she did not advocate for depopulation efforts. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2345.7200000000003s)]
*  I didn't think she said she was advocating for depopulation efforts. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2349.44s)]
*  But what she was saying was that the world has too many people. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2352.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2355.56s)]
*  But she was not saying that people should die. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2356.56s)]
*  And she's saying like, but you know what I mean? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2359.08s)]
*  Like that is, but hold on. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2363.0s)]
*  That's a valid thought. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2364.7200000000003s)]
*  Even if you love people and you're not an evil person, that is a valid thought that [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2367.0s)]
*  without any pain and suffering, it would be better if there were less people. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2370.84s)]
*  That's a valid thought. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2375.08s)]
*  It really is. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2376.2799999999997s)]
*  If there was less people, there would be less congestion. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2378.04s)]
*  People would be more relaxed, there'd be more resources, it'd be easier to get along, it'd [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2381.62s)]
*  be more balanced on earth. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2384.84s)]
*  That is true. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2386.48s)]
*  She is right. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2387.6s)]
*  But the problem with that thought is if you start expressing it, then people start saying, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2389.4s)]
*  I think we can make that happen. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2395.36s)]
*  And then there's werewolves get involved. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2397.56s)]
*  The werewolves. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2398.92s)]
*  Werewolves get involved and go, you know, if we didn't do this and if we went along [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2399.92s)]
*  the way, we instituted a social credit score and tied up all the money in centralized digital [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2402.2000000000003s)]
*  currency and then attached a carbon tax to everything everybody does. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2406.52s)]
*  We basically limit their behavior. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2409.92s)]
*  We'd be in control of the entire thing. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2411.6800000000003s)]
*  And then people start dying. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2413.88s)]
*  You know, people die. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2416.36s)]
*  Hey man, things change. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2418.28s)]
*  Climate change is killing people. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2419.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you know, a lot of kids are having heart attacks due to climate change. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2420.6400000000003s)]
*  You could start finding more universities and start popping them up worldwide. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2424.04s)]
*  That's a worldwide situation. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2427.96s)]
*  When you see stories like that, like young people are going to have heart attacks due [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2429.32s)]
*  to climate change. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2432.72s)]
*  I've seen those. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2433.72s)]
*  Like yeah, yeah. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2435.48s)]
*  Anything else? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2437.2s)]
*  Anything else give kids heart attacks? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2438.8s)]
*  Thanks for writing that article. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2441.08s)]
*  I'll be sure to make sure that the kids get water when it gets hot after running. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2442.08s)]
*  Anything else give them heart attacks that you guys ever found? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2447.32s)]
*  Have you been looking around? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2449.72s)]
*  No, nothing. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2450.72s)]
*  Nothing over here. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2452.4399999999996s)]
*  Just climate change. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2453.4399999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2454.9199999999996s)]
*  So, like what is the uptick in the amount of kids having heart attacks? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2455.9199999999996s)]
*  And is it corresponding to a certain temperature rise? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2459.8799999999997s)]
*  It seems like that would be like scientifically you could measure that. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2462.12s)]
*  If there was an uptick and the temperature raised 1% and we saw a 10% increase in heart [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2465.7599999999998s)]
*  attacks amongst 18 year olds. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2470.2s)]
*  Which is happening, right? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2471.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't know what the number is, but I do know that the number of deaths is what's the [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2472.9199999999996s)]
*  spooky one because the all cause mortality spiked way up. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2480.36s)]
*  That's what's freaky. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2487.36s)]
*  That's a freaky one. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2488.84s)]
*  That's freaky one. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2489.92s)]
*  And you could attribute, and you have to be really fair about that. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2491.4s)]
*  You could attribute that to a bunch of different things. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2495.32s)]
*  First of all, you could attribute it to bad habits that people picked up during COVID. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2498.08s)]
*  That will take up a certain percentage of them. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2501.34s)]
*  A lot of people became alcoholics during COVID. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2503.1200000000003s)]
*  A lot of people did. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2505.44s)]
*  So that's a percentage. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2506.6800000000003s)]
*  Then you have to think about a percentage of people that got COVID and got fucking wrecked. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2508.8799999999997s)]
*  Because I know some people that got wrecked. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2514.0s)]
*  They got wrecked and they were compromised after that. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2516.3599999999997s)]
*  They got on different medications after that. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2520.52s)]
*  I know some of them that developed all sorts of lung problems and scarring in the lungs. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2523.3199999999997s)]
*  Some people got hit hard. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2529.3199999999997s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2530.3599999999997s)]
*  And this is not even vaccine talk. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2531.3599999999997s)]
*  Just COVID itself. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2533.3199999999997s)]
*  And then there's people that have adverse reactions to the vaccine. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2536.08s)]
*  There's people that unquestionably had autoimmune issues after they got it. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2541.7999999999997s)]
*  Now, what is that from? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2545.72s)]
*  Has that been fully discussed? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2548.24s)]
*  Or is it climate change? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2550.16s)]
*  It could be climate change. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2551.16s)]
*  Are we just going to go climate change on everything? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2552.52s)]
*  Too much breathing. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2554.72s)]
*  I'm willing to go climate change with you. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2555.72s)]
*  I'm totally interested in hearing what everybody has to say about climate change. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2557.4s)]
*  I think it's capable of giving heart attacks. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2560.72s)]
*  But I want a full conversation. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2563.08s)]
*  And if there's a part of the ... If you're looking at all the variables and there's one [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2565.8s)]
*  that you're ignoring specifically, one that's a novel medical intervention, never been tried [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2570.5600000000004s)]
*  before and it was done to hundreds of millions of people, you won't look at that one? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2578.5600000000004s)]
*  That's a fair assessment. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2584.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2585.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, like ... You're putting it out there. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2586.6000000000004s)]
*  I think all humans should do that. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2588.26s)]
*  And I think the problem is during the pandemic, a couple of things happened. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2590.1800000000003s)]
*  People looked at the people that were unwilling to get vaccinated as people that are going [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2594.2799999999997s)]
*  to fuck it up for all of us. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2597.24s)]
*  And the people that got vaccinated, they probably were a little nervous about it, but they took [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2599.6s)]
*  the risk and they felt like they did the right thing. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2603.7599999999998s)]
*  And you didn't do the right thing. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2605.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's valid. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2606.92s)]
*  That's a totally valid position to take. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2608.4s)]
*  But the problem with that position is you're being trapped into ... You got corralled into [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2614.4s)]
*  a very clear pathway. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2622.26s)]
*  There's one solution to this problem and we all have to do this thing to get to that one [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2624.1s)]
*  solution. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2628.78s)]
*  And once we do, we're going to be fine. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2629.78s)]
*  But somewhere along the way, if you're paying attention, you would realize that A, it doesn't [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2631.54s)]
*  work as advertised. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2636.86s)]
*  B, the studies they did never indicated any of the things that they were promoting, like [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2638.66s)]
*  that it prevents you from getting it or it stops infection or that it stops transmission. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2643.42s)]
*  No, nothing. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2647.98s)]
*  There's nothing on that. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2648.98s)]
*  There's zero on that. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2649.98s)]
*  So along the way, they lowered the expectations. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2651.82s)]
*  They lowered what you would get from it. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2656.3s)]
*  It's just going to keep you out of the hospital. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2657.9s)]
*  There's this clip of Joy Behar arguing with this lady from a long time ago when the lady [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2659.38s)]
*  said she had natural immunity because she already had COVID and she got over it before [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2664.78s)]
*  the vaccine came out and she's not going to take the vaccine. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2668.24s)]
*  And they're berating her. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2671.1s)]
*  Joy Behar? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2672.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2673.54s)]
*  Werewolf. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2674.54s)]
*  Berating her. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2675.54s)]
*  No, she just doesn't know. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2676.54s)]
*  You're very ideologically locked into a position. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2680.3s)]
*  It's a women's talk show. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2683.5s)]
*  It's in front of the public. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2684.5s)]
*  It's on a television network. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2685.86s)]
*  There's so many variables that would lead to not being able to not only not express [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2687.0600000000004s)]
*  yourself in a clear and objective way, but not even be able to look at the world through [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2692.04s)]
*  a clear objective way because it jeopardizes your income. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2695.78s)]
*  It jeopardizes your position as one of those people. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2698.94s)]
*  You get locked into a certain kind of thinking even if you're already inclined to think that [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2701.3s)]
*  way. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2705.98s)]
*  We're a thousand percent, but we all cross that path and it's easier for some than others. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2706.98s)]
*  And I understand the whole world of being there. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2712.9s)]
*  And I'm not saying I'm better, anyone's better, but you can't tell me at one moment in your [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2717.02s)]
*  life when you're saying the things you're saying, whether it's on a certain television [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2723.06s)]
*  show or whatever, and you know, you know. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2727.5s)]
*  Do you still want to be able to call that restaurant when it's busy season? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2731.54s)]
*  While it's packed? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2744.66s)]
*  You know. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2748.14s)]
*  So I get it. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2749.7s)]
*  And yeah, the money's beautiful, the fans feel we all love what we're doing. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2751.9s)]
*  The thing is that people's opinions are very pliable. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2756.14s)]
*  Whether you believe it or not, that's how cults get started. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2761.46s)]
*  They trick you into thinking a very specific way. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2764.62s)]
*  That's how cults get started. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2768.26s)]
*  The human beings were pliable. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2769.58s)]
*  And the best way to resist that is to not be married to your ideas. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2772.58s)]
*  Don't be married to them. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2777.9s)]
*  Be you. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2778.9s)]
*  Like you should have a core set of values. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2779.9s)]
*  You love your family, you love your friends, try to be a good person. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2781.92s)]
*  Do your best at whatever it is that you do. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2785.2s)]
*  That's the core. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2787.5s)]
*  All that other stuff, these ideas, you got to look at them for what they really are. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2788.54s)]
*  And sometimes you get the wrong one stuck in your head and then you identify with it [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2793.5s)]
*  and you defend it, even when it's wrong. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2797.46s)]
*  And I've seen brilliant people fall down that path, especially during the pandemic, especially [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2799.74s)]
*  in regards to the vaccines or the lockdowns or the severity of the virus for people that [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2805.02s)]
*  are healthy. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2810.42s)]
*  There's a lot of variables that were ignored that shouldn't have been ignored if we're [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2811.58s)]
*  going to be honest with each other. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2814.7s)]
*  The problem is you were one side or the other. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2816.96s)]
*  You were team vaccine or you were team pure blood. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2819.6400000000003s)]
*  And the pure bloods got locked into like MAGA and fucking hillbillies. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2822.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2827.1600000000003s)]
*  Dude, I keep going around in circles and I hang out with every gang. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2828.1600000000003s)]
*  I love every gang. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2834.8s)]
*  Everybody's got something to offer, which is why I think that's how we'll grow. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2836.76s)]
*  You don't have to join here, you know what you're here for. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2841.36s)]
*  The more I see, the more groups that are formed, you know, I remember being a kid. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2844.44s)]
*  You know what the greatest time was? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2852.32s)]
*  And my mom and dad were both working. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2854.96s)]
*  I'd be in the kitchen like a little kid. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2856.7200000000003s)]
*  And I remember Mary, Mary's the lady watching me. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2859.28s)]
*  And all the neighbors would come over and this one's talking about divorce. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2862.04s)]
*  I don't know what they were talking about. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2865.08s)]
*  And this one had whatever. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2867.28s)]
*  And everyone would get together and they're like they'd have cake and they'd help each [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2868.82s)]
*  other and they'd give advice. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2872.96s)]
*  You know, years ago, therapists would call friends and family and look after each other. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2873.96s)]
*  You didn't have you didn't have people. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2878.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, you had people nursing homes. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2881.28s)]
*  But I remember going over my friend's house like, listen, we're going to house my grandma [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2882.96s)]
*  in the basement. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2886.6800000000003s)]
*  She, you know, she dribbles and talks weird shit. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2887.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's like she was she had dementia. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2890.92s)]
*  But that's what we've lost. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2893.4s)]
*  And for me, what COVID did was it was the way the werewolves. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2897.0s)]
*  I say it's the werewolves. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2903.16s)]
*  The werewolves went, this is how we really ripped the families apart. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2906.0s)]
*  And because everybody has fear in them and everyone, your family has every human being [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2910.84s)]
*  has fear in them. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2917.7200000000003s)]
*  And they're testing the more the werewolves get to test your fear factor, the stronger [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2919.86s)]
*  they become because they see who buckles. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2927.06s)]
*  They see who's going to call. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2929.7000000000003s)]
*  They see how many people they see who's lashing out. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2931.58s)]
*  They see how many people wearing a mask at the airport. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2934.42s)]
*  They so they're measuring the fear. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2937.38s)]
*  And you know, man, I just I pray to God it's time. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2941.1s)]
*  It just becomes time for the fearless. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2946.9s)]
*  And what the fearless is, it's not a violent fight. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2948.54s)]
*  It's just you said some brilliant things. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2951.1s)]
*  I remember years ago you talk about this, the time of the truth. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2953.9s)]
*  And it really resonated like, yes, that's what we need in life. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2957.2200000000003s)]
*  Just just truth, just honesty. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2961.58s)]
*  Just looking after each other. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2964.82s)]
*  I think we're going to get there. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2966.14s)]
*  Oh, I know we're getting there. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2967.3s)]
*  We're getting there. We've got to be aware of the werewolves. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2968.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Well, we've got to be aware of the werewolves are trying to close the gate. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2971.7000000000003s)]
*  They're trying to close the gate before human beings without these enormous institutions. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2974.74s)]
*  Human beings have the power over the narrative and that human beings that you trust are real. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2979.58s)]
*  They do exist. They just don't exist in those systems. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2985.58s)]
*  They exist independently for the most part. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2988.7799999999997s)]
*  And they're they're real and they can tell you what's actually going on. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2991.2599999999998s)]
*  It'll shock you. But it shouldn't. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2994.66s)]
*  If you understand history, do you know what the number one group of people [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=2996.4199999999996s)]
*  in the beginning of the pandemic when they rolled out the vaccines, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3000.46s)]
*  number one group that had vaccine hesitancy, PhDs. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3003.1s)]
*  Find that. Find that. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3009.7799999999997s)]
*  There was an article that was reading. I hope it's true that in the beginning, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3011.38s)]
*  there's a lot of PhDs that were like, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3015.22s)]
*  because these are people that understand how these studies are funded, probably, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3018.7s)]
*  or at least understand how research is done and how research is done through the pharmaceutical drug companies. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3023.06s)]
*  So the pharmaceutical drug companies, they do their own research. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3028.7s)]
*  And then they don't when when something's peer reviewed, it doesn't even get they don't even get access to the raw data. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3031.5s)]
*  They get access to the assessment of the data by the pharmaceutical companies. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3037.3s)]
*  And the pharmaceutical companies can do 10 studies and they rig their studies in a way they get the most biased results. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3040.46s)]
*  And if eight of them show no benefit, but one or two of them shows a little bit of a benefit, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3046.46s)]
*  then they can roll out and then they start making. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3050.5s)]
*  So I think PhDs were very aware of that system and aware of the also if you're if you understand human psychology, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3052.94s)]
*  you're aware of what happens to people in a time of great angst and pressure that they panic. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3066.2200000000003s)]
*  And in every horror movie, you see this. People fall apart. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3071.26s)]
*  And the weaker you can make society, the more corrupted you can make society, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3074.78s)]
*  the more decadent you can make society, the more society that doesn't value discipline, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3080.66s)]
*  that doesn't value free will, that doesn't value people's independence and strength and health. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3086.22s)]
*  Well, then you'll be able to find more suckers when the shit goes sideways. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3094.3399999999997s)]
*  You're going to get more pussies. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3098.5s)]
*  You're going to get more people that are willing to sell out their neighbors because they were having a party and they weren't socially distancing. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3099.98s)]
*  You get a lot of fucking suckers because it's too easy to live today. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3105.7s)]
*  And it's too easy to develop into a fully formed adult that is made out of mush, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3112.3799999999997s)]
*  not just mush with your body, but mush with your mind, mush with your opinions, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3120.7s)]
*  mush with your will, your will to get things done, your will to work, your discipline to get up and get things done. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3125.62s)]
*  Those aren't frivolous things. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3133.1s)]
*  Those aren't things that you should ever equate to toxic masculinity or toxic feminine energy. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3135.14s)]
*  Those are powerful human traits. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3141.7799999999997s)]
*  And you've been tricked. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3144.14s)]
*  You've been tricked into thinking that weakness is a virtue. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3145.62s)]
*  It's not. Kindness is a virtue. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3148.2599999999998s)]
*  And kindness through strength is the most honest kindness. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3150.58s)]
*  When Francis Ngannou is being nice to you, it's because he wants to be nice to you. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3153.86s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3157.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3159.14s)]
*  That's a real when he's kind, it's real kindness. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3159.5s)]
*  They found 23.9% of the people who said they hold PhD degrees express hesitancy, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3162.7s)]
*  the highest rate amongst the various levels of education. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3168.2999999999997s)]
*  So the brightest people were like, yeah. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3172.14s)]
*  Think about what you said before, like with, OK, where the view or whoever was saying points, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3175.58s)]
*  it's in due defense. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3182.7799999999997s)]
*  This is a very addictive system they created that the werewolves created and that they, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3185.8999999999996s)]

*  So not a whole lot of people have time to break out of that, in my opinion. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3196.5s)]
*  Also, the people who watch them are all boomers and they grew up with all their information [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3202.2999999999997s)]

*  You know what I call it? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3208.66s)]
*  Someone taught me this. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3209.8999999999996s)]
*  Hold on a second. What does this say? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3211.2599999999998s)]
*  A sensitivity analysis found some people answered in the extreme ends of the demographic categories [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3212.78s)]

*  PhD group look higher than it really is. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3224.94s)]
*  So what kind of concerted effort would it be? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3227.78s)]
*  Are they saying that they asked them in a way that was deceptive? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3229.9s)]
*  If they either expressed hesitancy or they didn't. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3235.3s)]
*  It was an early study in 2021 that there wasn't a lot of studies going on yet. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3238.74s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you how you could get a study like that. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3244.3399999999997s)]
*  This is how you do it. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3246.3799999999997s)]
*  You do it while Trump's president. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3247.3799999999997s)]
*  If you did that shit while Trump's president, you know how many people were hesitant, including [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3250.02s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, everyone. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3253.2999999999997s)]

*  They were all saying that. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3259.1s)]
*  Every single one of them. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3260.3799999999997s)]
*  See if you can find a video of that. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3261.3799999999997s)]

*  I wouldn't trust the government. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3265.14s)]
*  The Trump. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3266.14s)]
*  This guy? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3267.14s)]
*  This guy? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3268.54s)]
*  This devil of a human being? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3269.54s)]
*  Trump's got a fucking, he's got a hair net on and a fucking lab coat and he's fixing [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3272.54s)]
*  up vaccines. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3278.18s)]
*  And maybe we could have hydrochloroquine. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3279.18s)]
*  Don't kill anyone related to hydrochloroquine, I mean it! [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3281.18s)]
*  There was a recent study that they just released that said that as many as 17,000 people worldwide [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3285.66s)]
*  died of hydroxychloroquine. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3290.8199999999997s)]
*  So I asked Robert Kennedy Jr. about this. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3293.8399999999997s)]
*  He sent me the actual study and he sent me what the results were and here's what was [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3296.78s)]
*  wrong with them. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3300.14s)]
*  First of all, they administered it to people that were already in the hospital for COVID. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3301.2000000000003s)]
*  You're supposed to give it to people within the first 10 to 14 days. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3304.5s)]
*  That's when it's effective. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3307.6600000000003s)]
*  After that, it's not effective. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3308.6600000000003s)]
*  After the infections reach a certain level. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3310.06s)]
*  Second of all, there is a level that you would give these people and this was far above that [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3312.1800000000003s)]
*  level and they were giving it to people who were already dying. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3317.34s)]
*  He was like, they're essentially overdosing them while they're already dying with hydroxychloroquine [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3320.06s)]
*  This contributed to 17,000 deaths. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3325.6600000000003s)]
*  Maybe it did. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3328.6600000000003s)]
*  Maybe people actually did do that and maybe they did that out of ignorance. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3329.6600000000003s)]
*  Maybe they did that because a protocol wasn't established. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3332.9s)]
*  Maybe they did that because they were just wrong. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3335.46s)]
*  But also, how many people would have been saved if they used it? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3338.1000000000004s)]
*  If you looked into that, you can't ignore that. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3344.34s)]
*  Hydroxychloroquine is a widely used medication that's been used for malaria forever, for [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3347.0200000000004s)]
*  a long ass time. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3352.5400000000004s)]
*  It became political, which is insane because it's a drug. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3354.06s)]
*  A lot of times, drugs have an initial reason why they created them and then they find that [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3358.98s)]
*  it works with something else and it works even better with something else that happens [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3365.2599999999998s)]
*  by accident all the time. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3369.42s)]
*  But the fact that they couldn't have it happen with hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin, that [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3371.7s)]
*  should tell you what's going on, especially with ivermectin because it had surpassed the [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3376.9s)]
*  amount of time so you could just get it generic. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3381.54s)]
*  So no one had a patent on it. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3385.14s)]
*  So it's very cheap. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3386.54s)]
*  Two things that I would tell people. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3388.98s)]
*  Just your example, if it's such a bit, before we even get into that, people still trust [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3392.3s)]
*  100% just because you say you're a PhD and it's on television. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3399.58s)]
*  Now that whole scenario is very much like 9-11, meaning, and even within their own department. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3406.74s)]
*  So if PhDs and in their whole thing, people were afraid to lose their jobs, they're like, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3412.62s)]
*  this is what the answer is when they ask the question, otherwise we'll take your license [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3419.2999999999997s)]
*  away. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3424.8599999999997s)]
*  You're like, having that reservation, Dr. Clancy. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3425.8599999999997s)]
*  That we do this appeal to authority is valid in certain ways. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3429.7799999999997s)]
*  So if I was going to ask an astrophysicist questions and I had a choice of either asking [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3433.82s)]
*  Jamie or Neil deGrasse Tyson, I'm going to go with Neil deGrasse Tyson. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3440.2200000000003s)]

*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3452.3s)]
*  Let's test it. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3453.3s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3454.3s)]

*  He's a fucking legitimate expert. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3457.38s)]

*  PhDs are like comics. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3461.9s)]

*  Absolutely it is. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3750.08s)]
*  When someone starts telling you, hey, you got to kill food because the food is making [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3751.88s)]

*  I'm not saying you should ignore that problem, but I'm saying you should look at all the [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3791.16s)]
*  ways to fix that problem and none of them should involve people starving. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3794.96s)]

*  One thousand one hundred and forty two operational coal mines, more than anyone on earth. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3802.18s)]

*  change the nuclear power. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3817.78s)]
*  Change the nuclear power and do it with new nuclear powered plants that have a bunch of [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3819.3s)]
*  safeguards set in that they they didn't have when they built Fukushima. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3823.68s)]
*  They didn't have when they built Three Mile Island. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3827.04s)]
*  The technology has evolved just like cell phone technology and television technology [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3828.72s)]
*  and computer nuclear power plant technology has also evolved and they can do it safe now. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3833.04s)]
*  And it's the cleanest form of energy. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3837.7599999999998s)]
*  All of the experts that are unbiased that I have talked to have convinced me of this. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3839.68s)]
*  It's a fascinating thing because in our mind we connect nuclear power to destroying the [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3844.4s)]
*  environment, danger, Chernobyl ruin forever, which is true in those areas. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3848.94s)]
*  It is absolutely true. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3854.82s)]
*  It's also true that it doesn't have to be that way. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3856.02s)]
*  It's also true that they know how to do it better now. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3858.42s)]
*  It's also true that they have better methods of containing these plants and they can actually [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3860.54s)]
*  shut them down now. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3864.7000000000003s)]
*  Unlike the Fukushima one that's still they have still fucking cool that thing down. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3865.9s)]
*  That that whole thing is a disaster. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3869.66s)]
*  The Fukushima thing is crazy. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3871.5s)]
*  They're all crazy. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3873.34s)]
*  They had a backup generator that got whacked to by the tsunami. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3874.58s)]
*  So they got nothing, no power. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3877.3599999999997s)]
*  So the fucking thing melts down and it's going to be like that for 100,000 years. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3878.8399999999997s)]
*  But that that's just that local thing. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3882.52s)]
*  You got to get the fuck out of that area and they have to learn and make better power plants. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3885.52s)]
*  If you let people if you think you have a carbon problem and you you have thousands [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3889.6s)]
*  of coal power plants that are just pumping into the actual air that we all breathe, that's [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3894.64s)]
*  way worse kids. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3900.72s)]
*  And that can be fixed with nuclear power. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3902.68s)]
*  That's what we should be concentrating on, not killing fucking 2000 cows in Ireland or [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3905.74s)]

*  There's going to be people that starve to death. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=3949.4s)]

*  I can see that. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4326.2s)]
*  Shitting outside is fun. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4327.679999999999s)]
*  I think so. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4328.679999999999s)]
*  It's the natural way to shit. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4330.5s)]
*  It comes out so easy. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4331.5s)]
*  It's like wee. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4332.5s)]
*  Yeah, because you're squatted down. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4333.5s)]
*  That's why they make those squatty potty things. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4334.5s)]
*  You know those? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4336.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4337.54s)]
*  Do you have one of those? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4338.54s)]
*  I don't. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4339.54s)]
*  I have one. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4340.54s)]
*  It helps. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4341.54s)]
*  I'm sure it does. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4342.54s)]
*  You shit easier. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4343.54s)]
*  I shit good, man. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4344.54s)]
*  I wake up, pang, then I have espresso, pang again. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4345.54s)]
*  Double pang. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4348.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4349.860000000001s)]
*  And then I'm good the rest of the day. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4350.860000000001s)]
*  And as soon as I wake up, it's weird. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4351.860000000001s)]
*  I think it's good. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4353.700000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4356.700000000001s)]

*  It's supposed to be regular. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4358.72s)]
*  I'm regular. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4359.72s)]
*  My friend Larry got backed up once for a long, he used to be one of the producers on Fear [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4360.72s)]
*  Factor. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4364.84s)]
*  He tells a story. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4365.84s)]

*  Oh my God. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4367.84s)]
*  He had to go to a doctor and they had to chip it out. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4368.84s)]
*  Oh. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4371.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4372.92s)]
*  It dried up and it got compacted in there. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4373.92s)]
*  And he literally had to get it removed. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4376.24s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4377.5199999999995s)]
*  Like get solid? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4378.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4379.5199999999995s)]
*  It got hard as a rock. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4380.5199999999995s)]
*  So they had to break it up. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4381.5199999999995s)]
*  In his intestines or down? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4382.5199999999995s)]
*  It's his butthole. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4383.5199999999995s)]
*  At the door, turtling. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4384.5199999999995s)]

*  It's too warm in there. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4389.34s)]
*  I don't know what happens. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4390.34s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4391.34s)]
*  I don't know what he was eating. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4392.34s)]
*  A lot of cheese. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4393.34s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4394.34s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4395.34s)]
*  But he got stuck. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4396.34s)]
*  It's some Greek cheese. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4397.34s)]
*  That's that flaming Greek cheese. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4398.34s)]
*  The great horse manure crisis of 1894. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4401.740000000001s)]
*  By the late 1800s, large cities all over the world were drowning in horse manure. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4403.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, makes sense. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4408.46s)]
*  The London Times predicted in 1894 that in 50 years time, every street in London would [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4409.580000000001s)]
*  be buried under nine feet of manure. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4414.1s)]
*  Makes sense. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4416.660000000001s)]
*  In New York City, they had at one point 175 foot pile of shit that created in the range [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4417.8s)]
*  of 16 billion flies. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4426.32s)]
*  Tell me that didn't cause the plague. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4429.32s)]
*  No, it did. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4431.599999999999s)]
*  It's 100%. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4432.599999999999s)]
*  This is what the roads looked like. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4433.599999999999s)]
*  Oh my god, that's insane. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4434.92s)]
*  That's all horse shit? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4436.48s)]
*  There's also each horse makes about a gallon of or a liter of piss every day. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4437.48s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4443.24s)]
*  So the ammonia smell on the streets. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4444.24s)]
*  And then what happens when it rains? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4447.24s)]
*  Oh god, it gets into the water. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4448.66s)]
*  See, I root for nature. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4451.0599999999995s)]
*  What did George Caron say? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4453.179999999999s)]
*  Well that's just people with poor planning. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4454.66s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4456.58s)]
*  Because when they built these wild west towns, they're like, okay, put a fucking house here. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4458.139999999999s)]
*  There's the road. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4461.38s)]
*  And then next thing you know, it's paved because you have cars now. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4462.38s)]
*  Then the horses are shitting on the pavement. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4466.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4467.7s)]
*  What? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4468.7s)]
*  What is this? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4469.7s)]
*  I love when that happens. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4470.7s)]
*  And they bite people. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4471.7s)]
*  They bite people. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4472.7s)]
*  They kick people. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4473.7s)]
*  They hurt little kids all the time. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4474.7s)]
*  They don't want to be ridden. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4475.7s)]
*  And then they would die. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4477.16s)]
*  A certain amount would die every day. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4478.16s)]
*  So they had to get like removing dead horses every day from New York City was a whole fucking [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4479.16s)]
*  problem. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4483.76s)]
*  Whoa, drag them off. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4484.76s)]
*  Where are you going to put them? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4485.76s)]
*  I'd be pissed if I was a horse. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4486.76s)]
*  Yeah, they should be pissed. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4487.76s)]
*  Hang out in the city. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4488.76s)]
*  You know, there's a sizable amount of wild horses in this country. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4489.76s)]
*  I've been to Carolinas and see them. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4492.639999999999s)]
*  There's a sizable amount in this country and there's a lot of debate on what to do with [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4494.5599999999995s)]
*  them. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4497.5599999999995s)]
*  What's the debate? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4498.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, because if they get out of control and they get overpopulated, the thing is they [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4499.5599999999995s)]
*  could like certain farmers have land that's their land for grazing for their cattle. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4504.5s)]
*  And if the horses eat up all the resources, that could be a problem. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4510.54s)]
*  There are instances of animals cross contaminating like brucellosis is a real issue with buffalo. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4514.58s)]
*  When the buffalo roam onto cattle ranchers land, they give them brucellosis and the cows [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4521.66s)]
*  start dying off. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4526.179999999999s)]
*  That's a real issue. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4527.5s)]
*  So that's one reason to contain them. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4528.82s)]
*  But it's also like every wildlife biologist when they're objective, they look at a balance [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4532.1s)]
*  of nature. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4538.72s)]
*  They don't look at it in terms of like, you know, what would the people like to happen? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4540.400000000001s)]
*  They look at it like how many mountain lions can exist in this area and how many deer can [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4545.56s)]
*  exist in this area. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4550.1s)]
*  And if the mountain lions population exceeds a certain number, what impact does it have [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4551.64s)]
*  on the deer? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4557.18s)]
*  And then what impact does that have on ranchers and people that lose their pets? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4558.18s)]
*  And then joggers, because those things are happening next if you don't take it. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4563.0599999999995s)]
*  So that's how a real wildlife biologist would look at it. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4565.36s)]
*  So when wildlife biologists look at horses, they go, well, this is a real fucking problem. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4568.68s)]
*  Because first of all, people do not want you shooting horses. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4573.66s)]
*  Like I don't, that is the one animal that I would never fucking shoot. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4576.28s)]
*  I can't even imagine shooting unless I was dying of starvation. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4579.8s)]
*  The idea of shooting a horse, horses to me, that's like shooting a golden retriever. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4584.0s)]
*  Maybe even more beautiful because they're connected with people in a weird way. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4588.360000000001s)]
*  You ride them like you're very intimate with that animal. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4593.6s)]
*  Those animals are amazing pets. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4597.280000000001s)]
*  And then not just like, pet is a wrong word because they're a traveling companion that [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4599.8s)]
*  you feed and ride on. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4605.0s)]
*  So it is a pet sort of, but when they're well trained and well taken care of, they're amazing [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4607.280000000001s)]
*  animals. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4612.240000000001s)]
*  They come up to people. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4613.240000000001s)]
*  I've seen people that have pet horses and the horse puts their nose in the guy's face. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4614.240000000001s)]
*  The guy strokes the horse's head. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4618.44s)]
*  They have a beautiful, intimate relationship. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4619.44s)]
*  The idea of shooting those things, that's like shooting wild dogs. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4622.1s)]
*  The only way to shoot a wild dog is if it's attacking. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4627.26s)]
*  Wild pets, like horses in particular, we know what kind of relationship you could have with [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4632.32s)]
*  horses. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4638.26s)]
*  That's like going out and shooting wild people. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4639.26s)]
*  You found wild people, like just too many wild people. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4640.26s)]
*  We just started shooting them. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4643.42s)]
*  Like what? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4644.78s)]
*  It's almost like that with people with horses. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4646.299999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4648.099999999999s)]
*  When I think about that, it's like, see, I always go back to the question of when, let's [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4649.099999999999s)]
*  take a rancher. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4655.259999999999s)]
*  Did ranchers, and nothing, I'm just saying in general, this whole society, and I'm all [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4658.5s)]
*  over the place, I'll get to it. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4663.099999999999s)]
*  Did ranchers, they ranch for other people or just themselves, most of them? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4664.7s)]
*  It totally depends on the rancher, right? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4669.82s)]
*  There's some ranchers that what they do is they lease land. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4672.54s)]
*  They'll roam their cattle, and then some of them, they put them on public land. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4675.38s)]
*  I was hunting in Nevada on public land with my friend Steve Rinella. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4680.9400000000005s)]
*  We were bow hunting mule deer. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4685.66s)]
*  We're in this area, and there's cows all over this area. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4688.14s)]
*  These cows are all privately owned, and so they pay a grazing fee, I guess. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4690.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the fee is. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4696.22s)]
*  I don't know how that works. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4697.78s)]
*  I don't even know if they have to pay a fee. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4698.78s)]
*  I don't know how that works. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4700.58s)]
*  The point is they have the rights to let their animals graze in a specific area, and then [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4701.82s)]
*  when it comes time to harvest them or whatever the fuck they do, they round them all up, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4707.46s)]
*  and the cowboys come in there. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4711.5s)]
*  Real cowboys, guys on horses. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4713.219999999999s)]
*  It's fucking cool to watch. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4714.7s)]
*  They're all over the place, so there's those kind of ranchers, and then there's ranchers [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4718.219999999999s)]
*  that have a contained ranch. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4721.66s)]
*  There's a lot of these out here in Texas, or like the guys at White Oaks Pastures, where [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4722.86s)]
*  have a fully contained managed ecosystem, and they have their cows out there. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4727.22s)]
*  They roam around. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4732.22s)]
*  They use the manure. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4733.22s)]
*  They use the manure for fertilizer. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4734.22s)]
*  They recycle everything. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4736.540000000001s)]
*  It all goes back into nature, including the dead bodies of the animals and the things [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4737.540000000001s)]

*  I always go, but you can't go back. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4749.46s)]
*  When did it change, and why did it change? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4756.22s)]
*  Money. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4758.58s)]
*  It changed with money. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4759.58s)]
*  No, but I'm saying, like me and you, we're sitting there, you got your little tribe there, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4760.58s)]
*  and I got my tribe there, and you're like, yeah, man, you go hunting, you come back, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4763.42s)]

*  If the meteor hits, if the meteor hits and we go back, we go back again, because we've [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4823.299999999999s)]
*  done it before. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4828.299999999999s)]

*  I guarantee you, at least in parts of the world, society has crumbled because of natural [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4830.299999999999s)]
*  disasters and people resorted to barbarism. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4835.179999999999s)]
*  And I think that's the reason why, if you go further back in history, people were the [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4838.0199999999995s)]
*  most ruthless. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4841.82s)]
*  If people really did exist in a very sophisticated way, which is what I believe, that it did [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4844.42s)]
*  exist somewhere around 11,800 years ago and then before that. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4848.18s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4853.5s)]
*  I think particularly in Africa. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4854.5s)]
*  I think if you look at the structures that exist in Egypt, there's no doubt about it. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4855.5s)]
*  Some of those are old as fuck, and I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4859.34s)]
*  that they're older than they think they are, especially when you have geologists that are [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4862.62s)]
*  observing these deep water fissures. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4865.42s)]
*  Like Robert Schock, who's done this work on thousands of years of rainfall, must have [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4867.860000000001s)]
*  created this, which is that pushes it back way to the point where there used to be rain [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4871.38s)]
*  in that area, which was like 9,000 years ago. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4876.1s)]
*  So now we're in this area. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4878.78s)]
*  How old are these fucking things, man? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4880.3s)]
*  And I think if something happens and the world falls apart, I think only the monsters live. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4882.900000000001s)]
*  Only the monsters. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4889.54s)]

*  Only the most evil dog-eat-dog people, because they're probably cannibalizing. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4893.78s)]
*  At a certain point in time, I bet people are cannibalizing. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4899.18s)]
*  At a certain point of starvation, if there's like a nuclear winter, when those things impact [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4902.62s)]
*  and the fucking sky is covered with volcanic dust for two years and nothing grows. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4908.38s)]
*  The UAE had no guns and nothing. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4914.22s)]
*  I guarantee people started eating people. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4916.06s)]
*  I guarantee we are the ancestors of people who ate people. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4917.42s)]
*  I think so. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4922.3s)]
*  I would buy that. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4923.38s)]
*  Dude, the Comanche did it. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4924.38s)]
*  Well, the Comanche didn't do it as much as some of the other Indians did it. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4925.740000000001s)]

*  They would eat their enemies. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4931.14s)]

*  They would do wild shit right here, the Nez Perce. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4934.54s)]
*  They would catch people and cook them and eat them in front of their friends. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4938.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah man. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4943.14s)]
*  They did wild shit. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4944.14s)]
*  And they did it for fun. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4946.42s)]
*  They did it to torture people. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4947.740000000001s)]
*  They would torture people. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4949.740000000001s)]
*  That's why Native Americans had no concept of surrender. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4950.820000000001s)]
*  Like, surrender. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4953.860000000001s)]
*  They're going to torture you and kill you 100%. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4954.860000000001s)]
*  You got to fight to the death. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4957.02s)]
*  You can't surrender. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4958.06s)]
*  Yeah, but don't you... [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4959.06s)]
*  Would you... [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4960.06s)]
*  I think about this too. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4961.06s)]
*  Would you, if you knew your entire existence was going to come to... [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4962.780000000001s)]
*  If you felt like, you know what? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4966.540000000001s)]
*  These guys, they've crushed it everywhere. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4970.3s)]
*  There's no winning this. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4974.14s)]
*  We fight to die or we become them. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4976.02s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4978.780000000001s)]
*  I always think about that with certain societies. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4979.780000000001s)]
*  Even ours. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4983.38s)]
*  We've never ever... [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4984.5s)]
*  Well, I can't say that. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4985.98s)]
*  But have we come at a time where you're willing to go, dude, we're not getting out of this [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4988.26s)]
*  one. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4992.94s)]
*  We're not getting out of this one. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4993.94s)]
*  So in the meantime, do we start taking out as, you know, doing as much as we can? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=4995.7s)]
*  Like, how do you... [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5001.78s)]
*  I could see that. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5002.94s)]
*  Well, think about what the Native Americans went through in this country. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5003.94s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5005.7s)]
*  I could see it. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5006.7s)]
*  Their plight was even more dire because we removed their food. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5007.7s)]
*  We removed the food. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5010.58s)]
*  We killed the buffalo. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5011.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5012.66s)]
*  So there was no independence anymore. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5013.66s)]
*  They couldn't exist out there by themselves. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5014.82s)]
*  Make them sick. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5016.5s)]
*  Yeah, make them sick. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5017.5s)]
*  Get them sick and take that food. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5018.5s)]
*  Make them starve. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5019.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5020.5s)]
*  And then when the winter comes and you got no food, what the fuck are you going to do? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5021.5s)]
*  And they offer you the reservation. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5023.54s)]
*  They did that. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5025.58s)]
*  They did that in this country. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5026.58s)]
*  So there's your answer. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5028.42s)]
*  And the way they treated those people is beyond evil. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5030.86s)]
*  The way they converted them in those schools. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5034.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's also detailed in 1923, that show. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5036.0599999999995s)]
*  I went to St. Augustine and there's this fort down there. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5039.74s)]
*  And as I'm walking through the fort, you know, people, you know, tourists just always walk [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5045.42s)]
*  by and look at all the pictures and the things like, wow, this fort is cool. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5048.38s)]
*  And on the wall is all these little Native American, little Indian kids just like traumatized [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5052.5s)]
*  but in school outfits. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5062.34s)]
*  And you see like, you know, the soldiers behind them. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5063.82s)]
*  And I'm just, I sat there and watched it and went, bro, can you imagine, can you imagine, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5066.98s)]
*  can you imagine how many kids you got? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5075.139999999999s)]
*  Three. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5079.339999999999s)]
*  Can you imagine seeing your children like completely indifferent, completely hostages [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5080.339999999999s)]
*  for the rest of their life? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5087.9s)]
*  And they watched their parents get taken out in front. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5089.28s)]
*  They watched their mom's throat get slit or raped or burning them while they're alive. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5094.22s)]
*  And now they're going to, dude, can you imagine seeing that or living that as a child? [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5102.9400000000005s)]
*  And now that's what's going to control you the rest of your life? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5109.780000000001s)]
*  That's heavy, man. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5112.820000000001s)]
*  And it's also heavy what the government did when they took gullible people and they gave [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5113.820000000001s)]
*  them land where the Comanche were. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5119.02s)]
*  They let them move in. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5121.740000000001s)]
*  That's S.C. Gwen's book, The Empire of the Summer Moon. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5123.38s)]
*  They just let these people build these homesteads. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5125.78s)]
*  And then one day the Comanche came and just slaughtered everybody and they kidnapped people. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5128.62s)]
*  The last Comanche chief was Quana Parker and his mother was Cynthia Ann Parker and his [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5132.179999999999s)]
*  mother was kidnapped but she was seven years old by the Comanche. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5137.0599999999995s)]
*  And she wound up marrying the Comanche chief and she had a son that was Quana Parker and [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5140.86s)]
*  he was the last Comanche chief. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5146.26s)]
*  And then they rescued her when she was in her thirties. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5148.099999999999s)]
*  And she kept trying to escape, go back to the Comanche. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5152.139999999999s)]
*  She had become a Comanche, like a full-on Comanche. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5155.299999999999s)]
*  I just saw that. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5157.86s)]
*  Did you talk about this recently? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5158.86s)]
*  Yeah, I talked about it many times. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5159.86s)]
*  I can't stop talking about it. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5160.86s)]
*  Because that's where we are. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5164.339999999999s)]
*  That's this spot where we're at right now. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5165.62s)]
*  If you drive like 10 minutes from here you'll find like Quana Parker Road. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5167.46s)]
*  Yeah, like they named the streets after Comanches up here. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5171.54s)]
*  I have a friend who has a ranch up here. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5175.139999999999s)]
*  He finds thousands of arrowheads. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5177.54s)]
*  And I'm not exaggerating. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5179.62s)]
*  It's nuts how many he finds. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5181.42s)]
*  He documents them all. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5183.22s)]
*  Go to JM Whitworth's Instagram. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5184.42s)]
*  It's fucking wild, dude. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5188.06s)]
*  This guy finds thousands of them. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5189.42s)]
*  He just sifts through the ground in his property. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5192.1s)]
*  This is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years of the Comanche riding horses, killing [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5194.740000000001s)]
*  deer, living off the land, living right here. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5201.5s)]
*  I saw a meme and it was a native and he said, we breathe the fresh air, we live in the nature, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5204.42s)]
*  our food is grown, we have everything at our resources, free water, we love each other, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5215.1s)]
*  we constantly are tearing it up all day. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5221.46s)]
*  They came along and thought they could do something better. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5225.96s)]
*  Look at this guy's page. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5228.22s)]
*  He finds these. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5229.22s)]
*  That's one of the ones that he found. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5230.22s)]
*  Did you find his Instagram, Jamie? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5232.7s)]
*  Wow, look at that. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5234.9800000000005s)]
*  You didn't find it? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5235.9800000000005s)]
*  It's private. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5236.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, it's private. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5237.9800000000005s)]
*  So these are just some of the ones that he's posted up. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5238.9800000000005s)]
*  He sent me some. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5240.900000000001s)]
*  I have one right here. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5241.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5243.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's legit. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5245.820000000001s)]
*  Good dude. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5247.780000000001s)]
*  So when they do that, what do they make that out of? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5249.9400000000005s)]
*  Different kinds of rock that they can chip depending on the place. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5255.18s)]
*  Some points are like obsidian. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5259.58s)]
*  Some points are different kinds of stone, flint, whatever they can shape into a point [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5261.3s)]
*  like this. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5268.26s)]
*  There's amazing craftsmanship involved in this too. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5269.26s)]
*  And you got to get it kind of in the same size every time because the whole idea is [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5271.780000000001s)]
*  you're judging, just like when you throw a rock, like the way they would shoot arrows [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5276.62s)]
*  is you know how you throw a rock and after a while when you're a kid, you know how hard [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5281.22s)]
*  to throw it to hit a specific spot, you know how to aim. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5285.9800000000005s)]
*  That's essentially what you're doing with a bow and arrow. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5288.9800000000005s)]
*  So you have to practice all the time and you have to have the weight kind of semi-consistent [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5290.46s)]
*  so you know where that arrow's going. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5295.06s)]
*  So you know this thing is that far away and in your mind I have to aim up here and the [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5297.14s)]
*  arrow's going to drop down and hit it in the vitals. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5301.58s)]
*  The whole thing of archery is it's an arc. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5304.06s)]
*  From the time it gets released, it arcs up and then drops down. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5306.26s)]
*  And the whole idea is try to figure out how far that is and how far it's going to drop. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5309.02s)]
*  So it's a very intuitive form of hunting and it's a very spiritual thing if you're doing [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5313.82s)]
*  this. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5319.02s)]
*  You're making your own stones, you're making your own arrows, you're chipping the stones [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5320.700000000001s)]
*  and creating these arrowheads out of them, you're tying it all together with sinew and [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5323.580000000001s)]
*  then you're making this and then you've got to practice and you've got to get really good [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5328.22s)]
*  at this thing and then you've got to figure out how to sneak up on animals and just launch [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5331.02s)]
*  these fucking feather covered darts of death. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5334.84s)]
*  And it's one of the greatest technological advantages of hunting that humans had ever [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5341.22s)]
*  created. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5345.9800000000005s)]
*  They created the ability to kill something that's really far away. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5346.9800000000005s)]
*  A good archer can shoot something with a traditional bow 40, 50, 60 yards away. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5350.14s)]
*  And a chimp can never figure that out. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5354.34s)]
*  But if they did we'd be fucked. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5356.14s)]
*  We'd be fucked hard. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5357.14s)]
*  We'd be fucked. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5358.14s)]
*  They would just storm cities just shooting people for fun. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5359.14s)]
*  They would 100% shoot you for fun. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5363.34s)]
*  And oh by the way they'd eat your babies. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5365.58s)]
*  There's been a lot of documented cases of chimpanzees eating human babies, stealing [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5367.74s)]
*  human babies and eating them. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5372.46s)]
*  Really? [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5373.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, baboons too. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5374.98s)]
*  Baboons have stolen babies and eaten them. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5376.46s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5378.38s)]
*  Have you ever seen that video of this little kid just wearing a diaper and they're out [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5379.38s)]
*  in the street and this fucking monkey comes and tries to steal them? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5384.42s)]
*  Tries to steal the baby. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5387.38s)]
*  Yeah, tries to steal the baby. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5388.38s)]
*  Yeah, this monkey pulls up in like a motor scooter. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5389.38s)]
*  That's right. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5393.14s)]
*  Yeah and grabs the baby and tries to drag it off. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5394.14s)]
*  Like in a little alleyway. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5396.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5397.1s)]
*  They have to chase the monkey to get the baby back. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5398.1s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5399.1s)]
*  Yo. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5400.1s)]
*  That's pretty sick. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5401.1s)]
*  That's Plan the Apes right there. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5402.1s)]
*  Imagine if he had a gun. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5403.1s)]
*  He'd just bang, bang, bang. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5405.1s)]
*  Here it is, here it is. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5408.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5409.9400000000005s)]
*  If that monkey had a gun, 100%. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5410.9400000000005s)]
*  In front of his parents. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5411.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, rag dolls it and then tries to drag it off. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5412.9400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5416.42s)]
*  And it's moving pretty fast too, man. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5417.42s)]
*  With something that's way bigger than him. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5418.820000000001s)]
*  And this guy is even, he is, and he's used to it because look at this guy. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5420.22s)]
*  He's not even running. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5424.54s)]
*  He's just like, what country are they in? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5425.54s)]
*  It kind of looks like the monkey's actually being yanked back on a. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5427.46s)]
*  Oh, you're right. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5429.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5430.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5431.820000000001s)]
*  Play that again. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5432.820000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5433.820000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5434.820000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, it's a stunt. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5435.820000000001s)]
*  That's right here. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5438.42s)]
*  Right there, he's barely got leverage to do that. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5439.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5440.9s)]
*  Well, how's he moving so fast? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5441.9s)]
*  And knowing that one arm. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5442.9s)]
*  That guy starts pointing at, well. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5443.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you're right. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5444.9s)]
*  But where, so there would be someone behind him with a cable attached to him? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5445.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5450.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5451.62s)]
*  That's crazy if that's true. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5452.62s)]
*  I mean, what was that? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5453.62s)]
*  Is there a harness on that monkey? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5454.62s)]
*  Do you see a harness or anything? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5456.179999999999s)]
*  Not really. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5457.78s)]
*  Boy, it does look like something's pulling him. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5458.78s)]
*  But, you know, around his neck, right there, around his neck you can see something. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5459.78s)]
*  Yeah, boy, it does seem like something. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5461.78s)]
*  His neck goes this way. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5462.98s)]
*  Did you see that somewhere? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5463.98s)]
*  Or did you just see that right now? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5464.98s)]
*  I vaguely remembered seeing something about it, but like I'm just seeing it right now. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5466.5s)]
*  Like, well, that's weird. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5469.3s)]
*  Yeah, look at, look at, look at. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5470.3s)]
*  How's it moving? [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5471.94s)]
*  Where's it getting the leverage to move that way? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5472.94s)]
*  Look how fast, look, it's getting dragged. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5474.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5476.3s)]
*  Because otherwise, how would it have the leverage to move that fast? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5477.3s)]
*  Look at the line. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5479.78s)]
*  You could, you could sort of see. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5480.78s)]
*  Oh, you could see it. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5481.78s)]
*  Yes, you could see it. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5482.78s)]
*  Oh my God, it is. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5483.78s)]
*  It's a cable. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5484.78s)]
*  I fell for that too. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5485.78s)]
*  Maybe that's how monkeys steal babies. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5486.78s)]
*  Maybe they use monkeys to steal kids. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5488.74s)]
*  Oh. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5490.74s)]
*  That's even scarier, dude. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5491.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5492.74s)]
*  Maybe they've trained monkeys to steal kids. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5493.74s)]
*  Maybe that's what it is. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5496.22s)]
*  And then we just watched it. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5497.22s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5498.22s)]
*  Nah, the guys were there. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5499.22s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5500.22s)]
*  Or they're showing everyone how to do it. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5501.22s)]
*  This is how we do it here. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5503.780000000001s)]
*  Listen, that's totally possible. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5505.02s)]
*  We're just going to show you how you do it, or you should do it. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5506.02s)]
*  Well, can we agree that people steal kids? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5508.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, 100%. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5509.740000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5510.740000000001s)]
*  So if that's true. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5511.740000000001s)]
*  Dude, I almost. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5512.740000000001s)]

*  I think it almost happened to me. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5514.740000000001s)]
*  If people are so evil that they would steal kids, which is real. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5515.740000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5518.06s)]
*  Then you don't think they would train monkeys to help them? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5519.06s)]
*  What, are you crazy? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5520.780000000001s)]
*  Of course they would. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5521.780000000001s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5522.780000000001s)]
*  Not only did your kid get stolen, your kid gets stolen by a monkey. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5524.42s)]

*  That's real right there. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5539.139999999999s)]
*  Why did they run away? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5540.139999999999s)]
*  They ran away from that baby? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5542.139999999999s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5543.86s)]
*  Is he trying to help her? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5544.86s)]
*  And then the mom came by and the mom got the baby back. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5546.94s)]
*  Look, he ain't letting go. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5549.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh my God, he didn't want to let go of the baby. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5550.0599999999995s)]

*  Oh my God, that's crazy. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5553.34s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5556.1s)]
*  Maybe it was a bunch of kids. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5557.1s)]
*  Wait, now watch. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5559.3s)]
*  It's little kids. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5560.3s)]
*  Little kids. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5561.3s)]
*  Steal that boy. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5562.3s)]
*  Run around. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5563.3s)]
*  Run back, fella. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5564.3s)]
*  Save that fucking baby, pussy. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5565.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's your sister. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5566.3s)]
*  Ew. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5567.3s)]
*  Ew. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5568.3s)]
*  Don't show me that again. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5569.3s)]
*  All right, so but isn't that society? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5570.3s)]
*  What do you think, how do you think you'd do if a monkey was trying to steal a baby? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5571.3s)]
*  You think you'd fuck up a monkey? [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5574.3s)]
*  Oh, dude, I'd go for him. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5575.3s)]
*  I'd start kicking hard. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5577.860000000001s)]
*  I know he'd come after me, though, but I wouldn't. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5580.14s)]
*  I'd be in it too late. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5582.1s)]
*  He might tear my ass apart, but I'm, no, if it was a chimp, I don't know. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5583.860000000001s)]
*  No, you can never, if it was a chimp, I'd do a lot of this. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5587.42s)]
*  You'd have no chance against a chimp. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5590.740000000001s)]
*  And then I'd lie. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5591.740000000001s)]
*  But I wonder how much chance you'd have against a monkey. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5592.740000000001s)]
*  I'd lie and say, hey man, I tried to help, but I couldn't get in there. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5594.9400000000005s)]
*  Look, I was looking at that monkey, I was like, what would my strategy be? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5598.1s)]
*  Well play it back. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5601.54s)]
*  Can you play it back? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5602.54s)]
*  Yeah, let me see that again. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5603.54s)]
*  I think I'd go straight for him. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5604.54s)]
*  If I had a face. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5605.54s)]
*  Try to kick him in the head. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5606.54s)]
*  The monkey that's on the stairs? [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5607.54s)]
*  I think I'm punting that monkey. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5608.700000000001s)]
*  I think I'm going to let that monkey feel it. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5610.96s)]
*  Yeah, I see, kick him really hard in the head. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5612.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to shin him. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5615.6s)]
*  You can kick him good, right in his head. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5617.08s)]
*  Or in his gut. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5621.16s)]
*  Bam! [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5622.16s)]
*  I'm going to power kick that monkey into another dimension. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5623.16s)]
*  But I'm going to be ready for that thing to bite my dick. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5626.96s)]
*  That's not like a little thing. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5630.28s)]
*  That 35 pound animal or whatever the fuck it is has insane power. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5632.52s)]
*  And it's fearless. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5636.32s)]
*  It's fearless. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5637.32s)]
*  Of these. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5638.32s)]
*  Right there you've got to smash that monkey. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5639.719999999999s)]
*  You've got to smash that monkey. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5641.2s)]
*  You've got to really put the boots to him. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5642.84s)]
*  And he also knows you don't have the power to fight. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5644.5599999999995s)]
*  What you've got to do really is grab him by his back legs if you can. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5648.36s)]
*  Or his tail. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5653.04s)]
*  You grab him, first of all you kick him as hard as you can. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5654.04s)]
*  But if you do get a scramble with him, you try to pile drive him into the ground. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5655.96s)]
*  That's what you try to do. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5659.36s)]
*  You try to smash him into the ground as hard as you can. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5660.36s)]
*  That might be your only way out. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5663.599999999999s)]
*  It's going to be hard to do because he's going to recognize what you're doing. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5665.08s)]
*  He's probably going to be able to twist and turn and stop a lot of the force. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5667.28s)]
*  But if you could figure out a way to slam that monkey into the ground over and over [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5670.48s)]
*  again repeatedly, I think you'd break it eventually. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5674.16s)]
*  But he'd be biting the fuck out of you. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5676.24s)]
*  That's a tough task. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5678.24s)]
*  I'd go for the tail. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5679.24s)]
*  He'd be biting the fuck out of you. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5680.24s)]
*  He would be jumping for your face. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5681.8s)]
*  But you've got to beat the shit out of that monkey. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5683.84s)]
*  What about the tail? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5687.96s)]
*  The tail. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5689.28s)]
*  The thing is he's going to turn around and bite you. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5690.28s)]
*  It's going to grab you. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5692.12s)]
*  The way they can move. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5693.679999999999s)]
*  They move so much better than us. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5695.24s)]
*  So you have to accept that this little thing is probably as strong as you. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5697.14s)]
*  See, I'm cocky right now. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5700.58s)]
*  I'm coughing. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5702.5s)]
*  I'm going to twirl him. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5703.5s)]
*  I think those 35 pound monkeys are as strong as you and me. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5704.58s)]
*  I'll double hand him. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5707.54s)]
*  How strong is that? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5710.54s)]
*  What is that? [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5711.54s)]
*  A rhesus monkey? [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5712.54s)]
*  What kind of monkey is that? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5713.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5714.54s)]
*  I think I'd get fucked up. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5716.900000000001s)]
*  I think I might be able to kill it, but I think I'm getting fucked up along the way. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5718.780000000001s)]
*  I'm getting clawed at. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5722.46s)]
*  It's clawing at my eyes. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5723.46s)]
*  It's trying to bite my face. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5724.46s)]
*  I don't think it would get to your face though. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5725.98s)]
*  That monkey I don't think would get to Joe Rogan's face, I'm being honest with you. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5727.66s)]
*  You could be shocked at how fast and how strong a monkey is. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5730.66s)]
*  If you don't fucking move accordingly, if you don't stop it while it's happening, if [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5735.219999999999s)]
*  you allow it to get a grip on you, you might be really fucked. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5738.9s)]
*  It might get your jugular. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5741.5s)]
*  There's a video of this guy. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5742.5s)]
*  There's this old man and he's sitting there on the ground and this monkey climbs on him [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5744.94s)]
*  and he's sort of accepting that this monkey is on him. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5749.0599999999995s)]
*  This monkey decides to scalp him. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5752.7s)]
*  This monkey just clamps down on his head and peels an enormous slice of skin off this [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5754.94s)]
*  guy's head. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5761.22s)]
*  What size monkey is this? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5762.22s)]
*  A small monkey. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5763.3s)]
*  A monkey like that monkey. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5764.7s)]
*  Like what we just saw? [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5765.7s)]
*  Exactly like that monkey. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5766.7s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is I think in your head you're thinking, you see this guy. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5767.7s)]
*  It's like a plane up in the sky. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5772.82s)]
*  This is the same kind of monkey, right? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5774.18s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5775.66s)]
*  This guy's sitting there and watching this monkey. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5776.66s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5778.62s)]
*  Dude. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5784.62s)]
*  Oh. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5785.62s)]
*  It just bit him and took a giant chunk of his head off. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5786.62s)]
*  So that's what I'm saying. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5790.54s)]
*  This is what you're dealing with. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5791.54s)]
*  Oh damn. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5792.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5793.54s)]
*  You are not dealing with. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5794.54s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5796.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5797.38s)]
*  That's his head, bro. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5798.38s)]
*  Just bit into his head and took an enormous chunk of his scalp off. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5799.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5802.62s)]
*  And you just saw it. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5803.62s)]
*  This is the thing. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5806.62s)]
*  I think you need to reassess where you are with this monkey. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5808.82s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5814.219999999999s)]
*  It just bites him. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5815.219999999999s)]
*  Dude, it could do that to your face. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5816.219999999999s)]
*  It could grab your nose and you wouldn't be able to get it off your nose. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5817.219999999999s)]
*  Why isn't his head bleeding? [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5820.099999999999s)]
*  It would rip your fucking nose clean up. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5821.099999999999s)]
*  Why isn't his head bleeding? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5822.099999999999s)]
*  His head's not bleeding because that's what happens, dude. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5823.099999999999s)]
*  It bleeds out of the part where there's skin left, Jim Brewer. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5825.46s)]
*  There's no skin. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5828.9s)]
*  You're looking at skull. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5829.9s)]
*  You're looking at skull. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5830.9s)]
*  So all the things that bleed are now gone. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5831.9s)]
*  That's the stuff that bleeds skin. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5836.259999999999s)]
*  So all the skin that is bleeding is the skin that's around it. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5838.32s)]
*  He's bleeding into the fucking cracks where his scalp's been removed to his head. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5840.98s)]
*  That's real as fuck. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5846.0199999999995s)]
*  All right. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5847.0199999999995s)]
*  Maybe that's a new... [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5848.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm thinking that monkey might fuck you up. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5849.0199999999995s)]
*  I think you have to really reassess what you think a monkey is. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5851.179999999999s)]
*  You can't treat a monkey like it's a little person. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5854.0199999999995s)]
*  That's a way more ferocious, powerful thing. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5856.5s)]
*  You're looking at it proportionately because we think we're pretty big in compare to that [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5859.78s)]
*  monkey so we're stronger, but we're not. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5863.5s)]
*  We're just bigger. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5866.0599999999995s)]
*  All right. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5867.18s)]
*  So when I go for this fight for $40 million, you're going to be my trainer. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5868.18s)]
*  I'm not training you for you to get killed. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5872.780000000001s)]
*  You're going to get killed. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5874.820000000001s)]
*  You need years and you need to get on steroids immediately. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5876.620000000001s)]
*  What is the monkey type that bite that guy's head off? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5879.740000000001s)]
*  I think that's the same kind of monkey. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5882.700000000001s)]
*  End this corner! [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5884.18s)]
*  We got to get you on the full USADA protocol. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5885.18s)]
*  I got coming cocky. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5887.34s)]
*  Whatever USADA says you can't take, we're going to put you on it. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5888.34s)]
*  I'm going to have a cape with a big monkey head on it. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5890.46s)]
*  You're going to lose that Vitor Belfort in his prime. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5893.5s)]
*  Just all trapped. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5895.94s)]
*  Fucking jacked. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5897.94s)]
*  And here comes the monkey! [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5898.94s)]
*  And you still might get killed by that monkey. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5900.94s)]
*  We might have to train you for a decade. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5902.82s)]
*  Does the monkey come in a leash? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5903.82s)]
*  No, no, the monkey's free. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5904.82s)]
*  The monkey's running it. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5907.3s)]
*  You're in a circular room. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5908.3s)]
*  Train for a decade? [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5909.3s)]
*  Yeah, I would have to train you for a decade. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5910.3s)]
*  A full decade. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5912.38s)]
*  We have to just to give you a chance, just a chance to live. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5913.38s)]
*  Really? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5917.54s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5918.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5919.54s)]
*  I think you're dealing with a totally different thing. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5920.54s)]
*  I think you think of it like it's like a little person. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5922.540000000001s)]
*  But it's not. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5925.02s)]
*  It's not. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5926.02s)]
*  It's way stronger. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5927.02s)]
*  It's way stronger than a person. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5928.02s)]
*  I would way rather fight a 150 pound man than a 35 pound monkey. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5929.900000000001s)]
*  Well yeah, you crushed it. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5936.26s)]
*  You took him out of well-trained man. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5940.620000000001s)]
*  50 pounds less man than me. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5942.620000000001s)]
*  I like my odds way more than I like my odds against a fucking monkey. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5944.700000000001s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5948.540000000001s)]
*  Those are serious fangs. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5949.540000000001s)]
*  Dude, it's too strong. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5950.540000000001s)]
*  You don't understand how strong it is. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5952.46s)]
*  You think it's little so it can't be as strong as you. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5953.46s)]
*  But it's as strong as you end, man, stone to death by monkeys in India. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5956.219999999999s)]
*  They threw rocks at him. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5961.62s)]
*  They hit him on the head, chest, and legs. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5963.3s)]
*  They beat him to death with rocks. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5964.86s)]
*  I'm a good pitcher Joe. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5966.34s)]
*  I bet you are. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5969.62s)]
*  Look, if you had a weapon, I like you. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5970.62s)]
*  If you got something you could really fucking crack it with a baseball bat. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5972.78s)]
*  I like you. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5975.98s)]

*  You're taking me out. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5979.98s)]
*  If you got shorts on, good luck son. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5981.219999999999s)]
*  It's going to rip a giant chunk of your thigh out. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5982.94s)]
*  Well these are all rules we'll have to hash out. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5985.66s)]
*  There's no rules with chimps, bro. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5987.219999999999s)]
*  There's no rules with monkeys. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5988.58s)]
*  What am I allowed to wear? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5989.58s)]
*  Shorts or am I allowed to wear little armor? [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5991.58s)]
*  I'd be dressed like a knight. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5994.62s)]
*  Am I allowed to wear a helmet? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=5995.62s)]

*  Okay. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6033.34s)]

*  In comparison to what we think. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6039.620000000001s)]
*  Even strong people. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6041.46s)]
*  What is this? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6042.46s)]
*  A six-month-old girl was being breastfed in her mother's lap in a courtyard room in her [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6043.46s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6072.38s)]
*  I'm telling you, man, you don't want to fuck with a monkey. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6073.38s)]
*  All right. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6076.98s)]
*  I think it would shock you. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6078.98s)]
*  I had a chimp on news radio once. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6080.94s)]
*  And I don't even think that, I think that scene got cut from the final episode. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6083.22s)]
*  Because something had to do with animals. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6087.98s)]
*  So we had animals. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6089.98s)]
*  And so we had this chimp on set. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6090.98s)]
*  And I did not have a scene with the chimp, but I was there, so I got to like hold on [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6093.46s)]
*  to the chimp and like hang out with it. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6097.46s)]
*  Maybe I did have a scene with it. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6099.62s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6100.86s)]
*  Whatever it was, this chimp was a baby in a diaper. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6102.38s)]
*  And it was so strong, dude. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6106.02s)]
*  It was hitting my back, just playing, you know, just tapping me. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6108.5s)]
*  And I was like, whoa. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6112.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6113.74s)]
*  There was one on SNL and I got to go in the room, baby, and he kept saying, don't let [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6114.74s)]
*  him, don't let him nip at you. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6120.34s)]
*  Don't let him. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6122.54s)]
*  And he left me alone for like 30 seconds. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6123.54s)]
*  And all I remember is the skull. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6125.42s)]
*  Skull is really hard. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6127.42s)]
*  It was like a coconut. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6129.42s)]
*  That thing was very powerful. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6132.02s)]
*  And they were babies, like you said. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6134.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's a baby. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6136.02s)]
*  But it doesn't feel like you think a baby should feel like. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6137.02s)]
*  It feels like a super athlete. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6140.18s)]
*  Like when you touch their muscles, even though they're a baby, they're so jacked. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6142.12s)]
*  Like you feel their little muscles. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6146.7s)]
*  You're like, holy fuck, man. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6147.7s)]
*  You saw the no hair one, right? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6149.66s)]
*  That I mean, that is what it is. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6151.900000000001s)]
*  It's just pure. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6154.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6155.3s)]
*  And the no hair one that you see, like that one, if you think about the amount of muscle [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6156.3s)]
*  that thing has, it's probably like 180 pounds. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6161.7s)]
*  You got to multiply that times like four. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6164.46s)]
*  And that's how strong it is in terms of people. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6168.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6170.66s)]
*  It's a different thing, even though it looks so, like if it was a dude, if it was a dude [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6171.66s)]
*  that was. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6176.14s)]
*  But you wouldn't fear it. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6177.14s)]
*  But you would fear it. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6178.14s)]
*  No, what I'm saying is. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6179.14s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6180.14s)]
*  I would fear it, but they wouldn't rip you off. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6181.14s)]
*  That guy's fucking jacked. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6182.14s)]
*  I bet he's strong. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6183.3s)]
*  Well, take what you think about a guy that looks like that and multiply it times four. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6184.54s)]
*  And that's how strong a chimp is. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6189.3s)]
*  That's what's scary. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6191.14s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's frightening. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6192.14s)]
*  All right. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6193.14s)]
*  You convinced me. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6194.14s)]
*  I'm not going to fight the monkey. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6195.14s)]
*  No one can fight a chimp, but a monkey, you might have a chance if you're a bad motherfucker. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6196.280000000001s)]
*  You know, if you're a good kickbox, like Khalil Roundtree, he might fuck up a little monkey. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6201.46s)]
*  You know, get him with some leg kicks. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6207.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6209.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6210.54s)]
*  If a monkey doesn't understand defense, whap, whap. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6211.94s)]
*  As long as you can keep it from biting your face, as long as you can keep it from just [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6213.94s)]
*  getting a hold of you and biting a chunk out of you. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6218.42s)]
*  They will bite a fucking chunk out of you, son. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6221.38s)]
*  You got to have Kevlar clothes on. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6223.5s)]
*  You got to wear Kevlar clothes. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6226.14s)]
*  Kevlar gloves. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6227.94s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6229.1s)]
*  But then your face, what are you going to do about your face? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6230.1s)]
*  Your face is a real problem with a monkey. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6232.26s)]
*  They're going to go right for your eyeballs. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6233.9s)]
*  They know what you see out of. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6235.76s)]
*  They're going to rip your fucking eyeballs out. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6236.76s)]
*  Because if your leg game isn't working and he's able to immediately jump up like a grab. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6238.0599999999995s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6242.0599999999995s)]
*  If you just leap through the air and grab a hold of you and you can't get him off of [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6243.0599999999995s)]
*  you, you're fucked, man. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6244.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6246.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6247.5s)]
*  Although it would be great. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6252.5s)]
*  I'm sure, I wonder if they had stuff like that in the Roman Empire. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6255.94s)]
*  They did. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6258.98s)]
*  I'm sure they had people fight. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6259.98s)]
*  I bet they had everything. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6260.98s)]
*  And we're not that far away from doing that right now, man. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6262.98s)]
*  Watch slap fight. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6265.259999999999s)]
*  We're not that far away. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6266.259999999999s)]
*  No, you're right. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6267.66s)]
*  We're not that far away of people just having, I mean there's these organizations that have [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6268.66s)]
*  sword fights now. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6272.900000000001s)]
*  Why? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6274.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6275.06s)]
*  People dress up like knights. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6276.06s)]
*  They put full knight armor on. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6277.06s)]
*  Wayne, I feel like I've seen this and I didn't know if it was real or not. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6278.06s)]
*  It's real, man. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6280.9400000000005s)]
*  It looks like they really get hurt. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6281.9400000000005s)]
*  They really get hurt. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6283.860000000001s)]
*  They beat each other with their shields. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6284.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6286.18s)]
*  They fuck each other up. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6287.18s)]
*  And they're using axes too, no? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6288.820000000001s)]
*  They're using all kinds of weapons. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6290.46s)]
*  They're just using weapons while they're actually wearing armor. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6291.860000000001s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6294.06s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6295.06s)]
*  No, this is swords. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6296.06s)]
*  They fight and they fucking knee each other and kick each other and throw each other and [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6297.860000000001s)]
*  get on top of each other and beat the shit out of each other. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6301.3s)]
*  And they're doing it with armor on. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6303.660000000001s)]
*  It's wild, man. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6304.9400000000005s)]
*  It's wild shit. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6306.900000000001s)]
*  So we're slowly, slowly, slowly getting back until the Roman Empire. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6307.900000000001s)]
*  Look at this guy's hitting this guy in the head over and over with the shield. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6311.46s)]

*  Wow. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6323.06s)]
*  He basically beat him to death with a shield. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6324.06s)]
*  I mean, that's what we're saying. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6326.94s)]
*  If the guy lives, he's going to live barely. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6327.94s)]
*  Look, he's still down. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6330.0199999999995s)]

*  I'm like, wait, come on. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6341.58s)]
*  This is so insane. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6342.58s)]
*  This is so insane. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6343.58s)]
*  People are fighting with axes. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6344.58s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6345.58s)]
*  How about their fucking hands? [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6346.58s)]
*  What if the gloves come off? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6349.339999999999s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6351.0599999999995s)]
*  You get your fucking glove hacked, your hand hacked off. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6352.0599999999995s)]
*  Why'd he go from there to there? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6353.5s)]
*  I guess they got honor. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6355.0599999999995s)]
*  I skipped ahead. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6356.22s)]
*  I was trying to find... [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6357.22s)]
*  They got honor. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6358.22s)]
*  They start again. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6359.22s)]
*  Let me see some of this. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6360.22s)]
*  This is so crazy, dude. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6361.22s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6362.22s)]
*  Slashing at each other with axes. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6363.22s)]
*  Oh. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6364.22s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6365.22s)]
*  So they let you go once you're down. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6366.22s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6371.22s)]
*  They just stuck in him right there? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6372.22s)]
*  Still, all you need is one guy who cheats. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6375.22s)]
*  Yeah, got stuck in him. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6377.22s)]
*  Or just like, whoops, sorry. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6378.22s)]
*  They got stuck in him, man. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6379.22s)]
*  I didn't mean to juggle-y-er you. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6380.22s)]
*  Like the hockey dude. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6381.22s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6382.22s)]
*  Did you see that one? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6383.38s)]
*  Which one? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6384.38s)]
*  The hockey? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6385.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6386.38s)]
*  His neck got cut. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6387.38s)]
*  I did see that one. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6388.38s)]
*  That one's horrifying. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6389.38s)]
*  Horrifying. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6390.38s)]
*  Horrifying. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6391.38s)]
*  Yeah, we'll find that too far away from us. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6392.38s)]
*  Don't show me that one. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6393.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6394.38s)]
*  That's a bad one. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6395.38s)]
*  Yeah, but we're not that far. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6396.38s)]
*  If people are doing that, how long before people do it with samurai outfits on, fight [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6397.38s)]
*  with samurai swords, and slice each other up? [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6402.38s)]
*  You know, that was one of those things that would distinguish Nazis. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6405.38s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6409.38s)]
*  When the Nazis, through Operation Paperclip, when the United States acquired a bunch of [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6410.54s)]
*  Nazi scientists and brought them over here to work in NASA. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6415.18s)]
*  What, you're a conspiracy theorist? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6418.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6420.18s)]
*  And one of the things we distinguished, you could know they were Nazis, is they all had [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6422.18s)]
*  these distinctive facial scars, because they did dueling. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6426.18s)]
*  It was a big thing with the Nazis. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6430.18s)]
*  So they would put these goggles on. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6432.58s)]
*  See the scars they have on their face? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6434.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6436.18s)]
*  These guys would put on these, and they would put on these, and they would put on these [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6437.18s)]
*  goggles on, and they would sword fight each other with these very thin razor sharp swords. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6440.9800000000005s)]
*  Wow, look at the gut. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6446.9800000000005s)]
*  It was like a badge of honor to have these facial scars. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6448.9800000000005s)]
*  It made you look like a bad motherfucker. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6452.9800000000005s)]
*  So all these guys had these massive facial scars. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6454.9800000000005s)]
*  And that was one way where you could tell that someone was a Nazi. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6457.9800000000005s)]
*  Look at that guy with the goggles on. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6460.9800000000005s)]
*  So that's what they would look like after the fights. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6462.9800000000005s)]
*  They would just get their face sliced up. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6464.9800000000005s)]
*  And then what did they become after this? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6466.9800000000005s)]
*  They became our scientists. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6469.78s)]
*  They worked for NASA. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6471.78s)]
*  But these were Nazis, and this was something that Nazis did when they were younger. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6473.78s)]
*  They would have these sword fights with goggles on. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6476.78s)]
*  And it was like a sign that you were the real deal. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6479.78s)]
*  You were the real deal. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6483.78s)]
*  You got the big face scar. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6484.78s)]
*  You fucking fought with a sword. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6485.78s)]
*  It's a different level of commitment. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6487.78s)]
*  Correct. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6489.78s)]
*  It's like a gang, another gang. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6490.78s)]
*  You got to kill a guy on a Wednesday and bring me his ear back. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6492.78s)]
*  Google NASA scientists with Nazi dueling scars. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6499.58s)]
*  We're going to open. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6505.58s)]
*  We're going to... [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6506.58s)]
*  We're going to slice our face. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6507.58s)]
*  Imagine you're trying to get to the moon. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6509.58s)]
*  You're like, I think it would be an amazing thing for mankind. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6511.58s)]
*  And then you go, I'd like to introduce you to Dr. Hevenstein. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6514.58s)]
*  Dr. Hevenstein, this is Marty. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6518.58s)]
*  He's going to help you with all your needs with rocketry. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6521.58s)]
*  And you look at this big ass scar on this dude's face. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6524.58s)]
*  Did you just bring a Nazi to help me? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6528.38s)]
*  Is this a fucking Nazi? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6530.38s)]
*  How bad do you want to be on science? [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6532.38s)]
*  Is this a real Nazi? [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6535.38s)]
*  Yeah, look at this dude. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6538.38s)]
*  Are you really? [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6539.38s)]
*  Look at the scars on that guy's face. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6540.38s)]
*  The first director of NASA's Cape Canaveral was Nazi scientist Kurt Heinrich de Boos. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6541.38s)]
*  Also a participant in Operation Paperclip. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6546.38s)]
*  So what happened was the war was over. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6549.38s)]
*  And for whatever reason, Germany had some of the most incredible scientists, man. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6552.38s)]
*  Can I just say, if you look at, look at, go from Kennedy's, Kenny, the guy with the Nazi, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6558.18s)]
*  his face almost looks like this is not what I was promised. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6567.18s)]
*  The other guy is like, don't, I guess that's a way. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6571.18s)]
*  Kennedy's like, what the fuck is going on? [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6577.18s)]
*  The guy with the shades on? [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6580.18s)]
*  Yeah, the guy behind him going. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6582.18s)]
*  That's the guy that's in the grassy knoll. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6584.18s)]
*  He is doing it. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6585.18s)]
*  That's the dude that killed Kennedy. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6586.9800000000005s)]
*  100%. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6587.9800000000005s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6588.9800000000005s)]
*  Look at Kenny's going. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6589.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6590.9800000000005s)]
*  Look at his body language. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6591.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6592.9800000000005s)]
*  Look at his body language. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6593.9800000000005s)]
*  He's the only one with the body language going, wait, what's going on right now? [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6594.9800000000005s)]
*  And then the other guy's like, yeah, this is my bitch. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6598.58s)]
*  The man with the face, I slit his face. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6600.58s)]
*  What are they even talking about? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6602.58s)]
*  Yeah, what are they talking about? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6604.58s)]
*  Is this Apollo 1? [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6605.58s)]
*  This might be when it exploded or something. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6606.58s)]
*  No, did Apollo 1 explode? [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6608.58s)]
*  Or is it the one that exploded on the fire on the launch pad? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6610.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6613.58s)]
*  I just saw the video of it. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6614.58s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6615.98s)]
*  Was that Apollo 1? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6617.98s)]
*  No, I don't believe Apollo 1 was in 63, was it? [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6618.98s)]
*  I'm just going to check, but when I was looking around for this guy, it said he was also the [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6621.98s)]
*  leader of Apollo 1. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6626.78s)]
*  Okay, but I don't think that was later. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6628.78s)]
*  I think Apollo 1 was long after Kennedy had been assassinated, I believe. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6632.58s)]
*  So the moon landing was 69. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6638.78s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6640.88s)]
*  So Apollo 1 was 67? [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6642.1s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6644.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah, that's what it just said. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6645.379999999999s)]
*  So this wouldn't have been that. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6646.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6647.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it would have been something else. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6648.379999999999s)]
*  But at the end of the day, there were Nazis. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6649.379999999999s)]
*  62 is what this is. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6651.379999999999s)]
*  They hired a gang of Nazis to figure out how to get to the moon, including Werner von Braun, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6653.379999999999s)]
*  the head guy of NASA. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6659.379999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6661.379999999999s)]
*  The Simon Wiesenthal Center. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6662.379999999999s)]
*  But a lot of people, you can say it a million times and they can look it up and they absorb [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6663.379999999999s)]
*  it. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6673.78s)]
*  But a lot of people still don't comprehend it, which is mind boggling. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6674.78s)]
*  But then you have to start questioning, okay, so if we started back then, when did it really, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6681.78s)]
*  really start? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6689.78s)]
*  And then how involved? [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6690.78s)]
*  I think a lot of people are afraid to put that much time and thought into, whoa, maybe [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6692.78s)]
*  there's a lot of things that have happened that we've been told and that we've been educated [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6699.78s)]
*  on by the very great professors and all the information and time is not exactly what you [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6705.38s)]
*  may thought it had been. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6714.5s)]
*  And for some reason, I feel like so much of the population is, they just don't even want [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6715.66s)]
*  to hear it or take the time because for whatever reason, it's too much. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6722.259999999999s)]
*  There's a lot to sift through. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6726.98s)]
*  It's a lot to sift through. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6728.86s)]
*  Especially, there's so many different things to sift through. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6729.86s)]
*  Like if you want to get into the Federal Reserve, like what is it? [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6732.86s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6735.9s)]
*  It's not a federal institution? [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6736.9s)]
*  When you want to go into that, it takes so long just to get into the Federal Reserve, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6738.66s)]
*  just to try to figure out how money works. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6743.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6745.38s)]
*  And what is the federal reserve? [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6746.38s)]
*  How many people still think the Federal Reserve is federal? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6747.94s)]
*  Most people. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6751.9s)]
*  It says federal in the name. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6752.9s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6753.9s)]
*  It's genius. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6754.9s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6755.9s)]
*  It's genius. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6756.9s)]
*  It's genius. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6757.98s)]
*  Because it works. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6758.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6759.98s)]
*  But it's also like one of those things. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6760.98s)]
*  It's kind of grandfathered in because it's always been there since Nixon, right? [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6761.98s)]
*  When did they institute the Federal Reserve? [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6766.339999999999s)]
*  Before that. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6768.179999999999s)]
*  I feel like it was a long time ago. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6769.179999999999s)]
*  Nixon took off the gold standard, right? [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6770.179999999999s)]
*  Was it Nixon? [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6771.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6772.5s)]
*  Who took us off the gold standard? [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6773.5s)]
*  Was it Nixon or was it Reagan? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6775.0199999999995s)]
*  I think it was Nixon because I think it was in the 70s. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6776.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6779.0199999999995s)]
*  It was like 1971, I believe. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6780.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6781.0199999999995s)]
*  So when did the Federal Reserve get started? [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6782.0199999999995s)]
*  1913. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6783.42s)]
*  So the Federal Reserve is quite a bit before that. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6784.42s)]
*  Woodrow Wilson. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6785.98s)]
*  It's all nuts, man. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6787.0599999999995s)]
*  It's just so nuts. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6788.0599999999995s)]
*  This just at the end. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6789.0599999999995s)]
*  Right? [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6790.0599999999995s)]
*  Here's the nutty thing, the fucking crypto thing. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6791.0599999999995s)]
*  The crypto thing is so wild. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6793.0599999999995s)]
*  I can't wrap my head around it. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6796.86s)]
*  There's going to be an amazing movie, I guarantee you, with Sam Bankman, Free Story. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6798.419999999999s)]
*  I mean, how do you not make an amazing movie about a guy who is worth fucking billions [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6801.62s)]
*  of dollars, lived in the Bahamas in a house with nine of his friends, and they all fucked [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6807.7s)]
*  each other and they all did drugs constantly. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6813.339999999999s)]
*  And they openly talked about taking amphetamines on Twitter. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6815.82s)]
*  One of the ladies that is testifying against him now, Caroline, whatever her name is, his [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6820.179999999999s)]
*  girlfriend at the time, she tweeted about how when you're on amphetamines, regular life, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6825.42s)]
*  she seems so stupid. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6832.259999999999s)]
*  Something along those lines. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6833.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6834.5s)]
*  About not being on amphetamines, regular life, seems so stupid. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6835.5s)]
*  She was there getting whacked out all the time. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6838.139999999999s)]
*  Find that quote because I know I butchered it. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6840.86s)]
*  And what is it? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6841.86s)]
*  This is a movie? [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6842.86s)]
*  I understand. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6843.86s)]
*  I'm just kidding about it. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6844.9s)]
*  These people, this is a crypto exchange, and these people were making billions of dollars. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6845.9s)]
*  But here's where it gets crazy. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6849.94s)]
*  They were the number two donor to the Democratic Party. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6851.179999999999s)]
*  So they're getting away with this nonsense. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6855.78s)]
*  They're doing it in a place where they're not subject to the same regulations. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6859.82s)]
*  That's why they go to the Bahamas. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6863.259999999999s)]
*  And then they're just saying, listen, everybody can have a piece of this pie. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6865.099999999999s)]

*  They're giving out pie. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6872.139999999999s)]
*  Everybody's like, this pie is amazing. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6873.42s)]
*  And meanwhile, everybody's going, where the fuck is my money? [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6874.42s)]
*  Nothing like regular amphetamine used to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal, non-medicated [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6879.02s)]
*  human experience is. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6883.18s)]

*  Wow. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6886.18s)]
*  It's definitely, but that's room for introspection. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6887.18s)]
*  Maybe I shouldn't be ripping people off. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6889.18s)]
*  If you're on amphetamines all the time, you don't have time for normal introspection. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6892.820000000001s)]

*  It's nuts. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6921.34s)]

*  Do you spend a lot of time going, all right, where is this all going to go? [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6923.34s)]
*  Is it going to go really beautiful? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6926.86s)]

*  human being, you're only going to have a certain amount of control. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6931.42s)]

*  was terrified that we were going to have a nuclear war with Russia. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6966.14s)]
*  100%. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6968.74s)]
*  100%. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6969.74s)]
*  It was a thing that was like in the air. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6970.74s)]
*  And I remember when the Soviet Union collapsed, I was like, oh. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6972.18s)]
*  I know. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6975.9400000000005s)]
*  Like a sigh. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6976.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6977.9400000000005s)]
*  We got less anxious in this country. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6978.9400000000005s)]
*  People don't know that. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6981.06s)]
*  These kids today don't know what it was like to experience that every day when we were [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6982.06s)]
*  in high school. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6987.42s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6988.42s)]
*  Even grammar school. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6989.42s)]
*  That started kindergarten. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6990.5s)]
*  All throughout our high school. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6991.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6992.5s)]
*  Go to the hallway. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6993.5s)]
*  All throughout our schoolings. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6994.5s)]
*  It was all, we were always worried about Russia. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6995.5s)]
*  Everybody I know that I talked to, people that grew up in Colorado, people that grew [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=6998.06s)]
*  up in California, everybody has the same stories. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7001.38s)]
*  So when that dropped off, man, that shows that things can get better. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7005.38s)]
*  Even it was only better for a short period of time. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7010.34s)]
*  And it's not even a short period of time. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7012.02s)]
*  This is how things go. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7013.9400000000005s)]
*  They go like this and then they go like this and then we push back and they go like this [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7015.18s)]
*  and they go up and they go down and you got to constantly be trying to like move it in [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7018.5199999999995s)]
*  a direction where there's the least amount of corruption possible. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7022.36s)]
*  And that's fucking hard when people have control over things. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7026.2s)]
*  And that's why you should fight against control because control is never good. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7029.08s)]
*  It's never good when they can just decide what you do and where you go. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7034.74s)]
*  This is the fucking end point is always communism. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7038.48s)]
*  If you just keep going, like Jordan Peterson said, keep going down that line, you get to [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7041.98s)]
*  a communist dictatorship. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7045.62s)]
*  And when you hear all that kind of talk and it's easy for people who don't have anything [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7047.92s)]
*  to go, yeah, the people who have it, they should give it to the people who don't have it. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7050.76s)]
*  Okay, who's telling you this? [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7054.360000000001s)]
*  The government is telling you this. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7056.24s)]
*  Why? [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7057.52s)]
*  Because they want you to fight against each other. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7058.52s)]
*  This is all crazy talk. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7059.68s)]
*  The billionaire is telling you and telling the masses like, no, you should share it for [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7061.52s)]
*  everyone. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7066.360000000001s)]
*  The guy with the four houses. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7067.360000000001s)]
*  That guy, how do you not, half his face is starting to hang now. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7071.96s)]
*  It's a fascinating exercise that he's chosen to engage in. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7075.62s)]
*  Yes. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7081.34s)]
*  If you, there's, that's a big one. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7082.34s)]
*  Well, that's a big, but it's getting fuzzy. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7088.7s)]
*  If you're playing that game, right? [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7090.94s)]
*  And if you're in that, like that's what, when you have those guys, the speculators, the [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7092.82s)]
*  guys who are involved in betting on businesses collapsing. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7098.18s)]
*  You know, there's like a lot of people that are invested in destroying things, hostile [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7102.740000000001s)]
*  takeovers. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7107.34s)]
*  They enjoy those things. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7108.34s)]
*  I had a friend who started a company as his own company and hired this guy. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7109.34s)]
*  I think I don't forget what his job was, but a high level executive. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7115.34s)]
*  And then they tried to start a coup to get him kicked out of his own company that he [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7119.34s)]
*  started. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7122.540000000001s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7123.540000000001s)]
*  And again, it's happening there. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7124.540000000001s)]
*  He had a battle it for a long time. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7126.740000000001s)]
*  It took a long time to get out from under it. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7128.660000000001s)]
*  I was like, whoa, this is a company that he started, but that's what people do. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7130.94s)]
*  Do you think that's what people do? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7137.219999999999s)]
*  They try to always get more and more power. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7138.7s)]
*  It's just what people do. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7140.98s)]
*  I feel there may come a time, I don't know, where, it's going to take a lot, where we [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7142.5s)]
*  have a game show where like we start, you start uniting people. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7157.02s)]
*  I always say, put a game show together, unite the people, right? [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7161.46s)]
*  And you put the left on one side or right side and you're allowed to talk. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7165.740000000001s)]
*  You have to talk and you have to connect before the end of the day. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7171.22s)]
*  You got to come out as best friend. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7174.660000000001s)]
*  But anytime you mention politics or something you think you know, but you clearly learned [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7176.42s)]
*  it from, you're emotionally involved, you get zapped, electrocuted. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7182.580000000001s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7185.98s)]
*  And it's just the whole game is like, for instance, for instance, if you bring up politics [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7186.98s)]
*  and get zapped. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7193.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7194.179999999999s)]
*  Like for instance, cause we need to unite. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7195.179999999999s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7196.179999999999s)]
*  We need to unite. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7197.98s)]
*  So like when we had no, when we had no supplies, okay, man, we got no supplies, but you'd have [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7199.879999999999s)]
*  a billion Trump boating parades. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7208.219999999999s)]
*  You tell me at that time how to put the two sides together. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7211.66s)]
*  You could have took the Trump boat parades and you had to put on everyone that hates [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7215.22s)]
*  Trump and you get like, you know, you put, and you go get the supplies and you've, but [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7218.820000000001s)]
*  any time you have to connect, get the supplies without fighting about politics. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7225.1s)]
*  The point of the story is, I'm all over the place. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7229.7s)]
*  The point of the story is it doesn't matter how much you hate each other, how divided [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7234.18s)]
*  what you think about. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7239.06s)]
*  We're all going to connect the minute you un, I feel we unplug from it all and ignore [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7240.5s)]
*  it all. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7245.94s)]
*  I don't know how that looks though. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7246.94s)]
*  We're all going to connect if there's another conflict, if there's a conflict on our shores, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7248.98s)]
*  we're all going to connect again. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7252.54s)]
*  That that would be undeniable. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7254.1s)]
*  If there was some sort of an attack, another 9 11, that would be what brought people together [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7255.46s)]
*  in 2001 would bring people together in 2024. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7260.38s)]
*  When it brought people together in 2001, it was shocking. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7264.18s)]
*  Everywhere in LA, everybody had American flags on their cars. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7267.34s)]
*  There's a totally different vibe. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7270.06s)]
*  And again, I hate to say it because I don't want it to happen. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7272.3s)]
*  No. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7275.3s)]
*  But when people realized like what's really important and that it's not all this bullshit [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7276.3s)]
*  that people are fighting about all the time. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7281.54s)]
*  I think that's, I used to think I used to joke about the idea that intelligence agencies [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7283.3s)]
*  would infiltrate areas of society and ruin them to keep people fighting against each [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7290.34s)]
*  other. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7296.46s)]
*  I'm like, why would they do that? [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7297.46s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7298.46s)]
*  They don't have the time to do that. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7299.86s)]
*  But now I think they definitely have done that. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7301.7s)]
*  They've fucking definitely done that. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7304.14s)]
*  So that that's kind of a crazy thing when you got something that's working for the people [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7305.78s)]
*  and against the people on the people's money. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7313.22s)]
*  And I think a lot. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7315.86s)]
*  I know this sounds crazy, but I think a lot of that has to do with spirit. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7316.86s)]
*  Like what you said, when everything went down, everyone looked at the the the firemen, the [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7320.0s)]
*  police officers, everyone that helped as hero. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7326.3s)]
*  There was a spirit. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7328.66s)]
*  There was a spirit that united people that want to now going into conflict was a whole [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7329.66s)]
*  different story. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7335.3s)]
*  And I also felt over the next couple after that spirit, I almost feel like, oh, man, [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7336.3s)]
*  the bad guys, they didn't expect that much spirit from us to look after each other. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7342.58s)]
*  And then the next years, they're like, now we got to demonize the police and demonize [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7348.26s)]
*  it. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7353.18s)]
*  And I started all this complete chaos. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7354.700000000001s)]
*  And I do hope what you're talking about, like if God forbid, I pray to God, I think we all [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7356.62s)]
*  do. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7363.62s)]
*  No one ever wants violence of anything. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7364.62s)]
*  But I hope that's not what we need to make our spirits come alive. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7366.26s)]
*  I really do. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7372.42s)]
*  I think it's not necessary. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7373.62s)]
*  It's not necessary. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7376.9800000000005s)]
*  It's possible that we can get our shit together without that. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7378.1s)]
*  I know it is. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7381.18s)]
*  But I think that when things happen, that was initially in the beginning of COVID, I [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7382.18s)]
*  was hoping that would happen. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7386.34s)]
*  I was hoping we'd unite people. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7388.740000000001s)]
*  It had the opposite effect. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7390.22s)]
*  But I was hoping when the country got shut down, that people were going to be cooler [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7392.14s)]
*  to each other because they realized, like, hey, under the threat of something that none [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7395.42s)]
*  of us can control, that could take our loved ones away, we all have a shared interest in [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7399.780000000001s)]
*  common. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7403.5s)]
*  And that's keeping society running and getting back to normal again. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7404.5s)]
*  I think I was hopeful. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7408.38s)]
*  Because I had lived through 9-11. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7411.34s)]
*  I remember what that was like. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7412.94s)]
*  After those days, I remember people were genuinely nicer for months, for months, for a long time [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7415.34s)]
*  after 9-11. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7422.139999999999s)]
*  All over the whole country, everywhere you went, people had, they were cooler. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7423.139999999999s)]
*  You're 100% right. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7427.22s)]
*  But I do feel what that time did, at least for me, it taught me how judgmental I am. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7429.42s)]
*  It taught me how much anger I still have in me. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7436.62s)]
*  It taught me how much resentment I might have towards people. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7438.74s)]
*  But what it did do, like... [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7441.62s)]
*  9-11 did that? [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7442.98s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7443.98s)]
*  COVID. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7444.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7445.98s)]
*  We formed, like, I would go to this coffee shop. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7446.98s)]
*  I'd been going there forever and ever and ever. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7449.66s)]
*  And I talked about it a while ago. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7451.22s)]
*  But that group, and they still hang out all the time, there's a lot of differences in [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7453.179999999999s)]
*  that group. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7459.46s)]
*  Like there was a couple of us, there was one or two of us that would go around and around [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7461.46s)]
*  with vaccines and blah, blah, blah. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7465.14s)]
*  What are you with this? [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7467.660000000001s)]
*  And I tried to explain. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7468.660000000001s)]
*  The point of the story is I remember a moment where we were all sitting together. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7470.900000000001s)]
*  There's like 25 of us. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7474.780000000001s)]
*  Dude, do you know what it's like for guys to hang out? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7475.780000000001s)]
*  But when you add wives, and there's nothing against women or what, but when you start [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7479.06s)]
*  pairing up couples and they start hanging out, we started hanging... [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7482.38s)]
*  First of all, this group would hang out every day, all different walks of life, all different [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7488.18s)]
*  financial brackets. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7492.54s)]
*  And then after a while, you know, we play football, do whatever, we hang out. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7495.9800000000005s)]
*  We're like, we've got to do something besides drinking. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7500.54s)]
*  We start finding more things to do. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7502.14s)]
*  Then it brought us close and we started bringing the wives and then all the wives started hanging [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7504.26s)]
*  out. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7507.860000000001s)]
*  And then we started having big gatherings. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7508.860000000001s)]
*  My house, my friend Tom's house. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7510.02s)]
*  And we all looked at, this guy needs his basement. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7513.3s)]
*  Everyone's like, this guy's going to the airport. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7518.02s)]
*  This one's mother is having some issues and we'd all... [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7521.14s)]
*  And I'll never forget a really cool moment was we were in Morristown, New Jersey. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7524.46s)]
*  We were all sitting down and my friend Basil was saying, big guy from Greece. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7529.700000000001s)]
*  He's sitting there and I'm looking like, I go, Basil, how did this happen? [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7534.42s)]
*  This guy's a lawyer. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7541.3s)]
*  This guy's a 9-11 fireman. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7542.84s)]
*  My friend Joe. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7544.38s)]
*  This guy's a fireman. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7546.34s)]
*  This guy's a landscaper. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7548.06s)]
*  This guy's from this country. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7550.0s)]
*  And he just simply said, you know why, Jim? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7551.4800000000005s)]
*  Because he said, he's like, nobody thinks who they are. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7555.04s)]
*  And I feel like we live in a society where not only do we trust, we put way too much [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7561.2s)]
*  trust in people who think who they are. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7567.96s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7571.24s)]
*  What I mean is you are one of the biggest voices in the world. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7573.48s)]
*  You don't walk around the streets. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7581.599999999999s)]
*  You don't meet me backstage. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7583.879999999999s)]
*  You don't talk to the people if you're going to go to the deli. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7585.48s)]
*  You don't act like you are one of the biggest... [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7589.48s)]
*  A ball player. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7594.36s)]
*  There's two ball players, the billionaires. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7595.36s)]
*  One comes in, a lawyer. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7597.16s)]
*  Two lawyers come in. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7598.2s)]
*  One guy thinks he deserves... [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7599.2s)]
*  Do you know who I am? [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7600.4s)]
*  I'm the biggest lawyer in the world. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7601.4s)]
*  I'm the judge. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7603.2s)]
*  Do you realize I'm the CEO? [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7604.2s)]
*  Do you realize I'm the top veterinarian and the blah, blah, blah? [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7605.76s)]
*  Do you realize those people have been trained to a mindset that closes them? [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7610.28s)]
*  Oh, this guy's below me. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7618.2s)]
*  What does he know? [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7619.76s)]
*  I mean, this group, the reason we got along, and I'm okay with him being a pusher of vaccines, [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7620.76s)]
*  I'm like, you know what? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7627.56s)]
*  It's all right. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7629.04s)]
*  I still know the human side of you. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7630.12s)]
*  This guy's pushing his electric cars, which I think is the most ridiculous thing in the [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7632.84s)]
*  world, but you know what? [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7636.8s)]
*  It's getting him and this guy through and blah, blah, blah. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7639.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, when we really need each one another, when it came from family [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7641.36s)]
*  or an issue or tragedy, we didn't care about any of that. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7645.16s)]
*  We didn't care that I was a comedian. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7649.84s)]
*  We didn't care about any of us what we did. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7652.4s)]
*  It was that spirit and nucleus of just us being pure humans and caring with our hearts [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7655.16s)]
*  after one another rather than giving a shit what we do for a living. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7661.5599999999995s)]
*  And do you know who I am? [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7665.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to sit here while you disparage electric cars. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7666.639999999999s)]
*  I got one. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7669.36s)]
*  I got one. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7672.12s)]
*  They're the shit. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7673.12s)]
*  I got one. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7674.12s)]
*  Jamie. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7675.12s)]
*  I got one. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7676.12s)]
*  I don't think it's fully electric. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7677.12s)]
*  Do you see the new G-Wagon stuff? [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7678.12s)]
*  Oh yeah, they got a hybrid. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7679.12s)]
*  It's mine. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7680.12s)]
*  It does this 360. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7681.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7682.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7683.12s)]
*  It's got electric stuff on it. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7684.12s)]
*  You ever see the G-Wagon squared? [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7685.12s)]
*  It's like for people that don't think a G-Wagon is showy enough, they get a double-sized G-Wagon. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7687.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7691.72s)]
*  But the point is I don't care about electric cars. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7692.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7694.48s)]
*  Bro, they're amazing. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7695.48s)]

*  And it's awesome. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7705.48s)]
*  You need to drive a Tesla. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7706.48s)]
*  I don't want one. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=7707.48s)]

*  They're light. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8257.44s)]
*  This is one of his best ones. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8258.44s)]
*  This little thing is super light. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8259.44s)]
*  I mean, this dude is on a ride, son. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8263.44s)]
*  He's not in a fucking Buick. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8266.44s)]
*  Listen to that thing. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8269.44s)]
*  He's downshifting. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8271.240000000002s)]
*  Rev matching. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8273.84s)]
*  This motherfucker knows what he's doing. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8274.84s)]
*  He knows how to drive one of these things. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8275.84s)]
*  That's a little piece of art. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8277.84s)]
*  That's a different experience. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8280.84s)]
*  That's his Zen. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8282.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8283.84s)]
*  That's your Zen. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8284.84s)]
*  That's so much different than driving an electric car. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8285.84s)]
*  That's the total opposite of an electric car. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8288.640000000001s)]
*  Because it's not the most efficient. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8291.84s)]
*  It's not the biggest technological marvel. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8293.84s)]
*  But it's the perfect balance of fun and feel. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8296.84s)]
*  I got you. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8300.84s)]
*  And transportation. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8301.84s)]
*  I got you. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8302.84s)]
*  Just makes my dick hard. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8303.84s)]
*  See? [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8305.84s)]
*  I'm the opposite with a bicycle ride at night. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8307.24s)]
*  That's a great thing, too. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8310.24s)]
*  Yes. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8311.24s)]
*  That's a great thing. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8312.24s)]
*  That's not the opposite. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8313.24s)]
*  That's a beautiful thing. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8314.24s)]
*  Taking a bicycle ride. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8315.24s)]
*  Pitch black. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8316.24s)]
*  No one out. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8317.24s)]
*  It's peaceful. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8318.24s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8319.24s)]
*  A bicycle ride at night is amazing. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8320.24s)]
*  Not spent a ride. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8321.24s)]
*  Ride. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8324.24s)]
*  Just get on a bike and just drive around. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8325.24s)]
*  Clear your head. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8327.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8328.24s)]
*  You know what I've done, too? [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8329.24s)]
*  It's nice. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8330.24s)]
*  What's that? [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8331.24s)]
*  Jet skis on a lake at night. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8332.24s)]
*  Not going fast. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8333.24s)]
*  Just toon around, bro. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8334.24s)]
*  I want jet skis. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8335.64s)]
*  Not that I want. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8337.64s)]
*  I would love, if I had the opportunity, jet skis rather than a boat. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8338.64s)]
*  Jet skis are amazing because you can go so fast on those fucking things and there's no [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8344.24s)]
*  risk. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8349.24s)]
*  Well, there's a risk. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8350.24s)]
*  You could definitely hurt yourself if you fell. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8351.24s)]
*  But not nearly the same kind of risk if you're on a motorcycle. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8352.24s)]
*  You're like on a motorcycle. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8355.24s)]
*  Just on a motorcycle on the water. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8356.24s)]
*  But it's really balanced. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8358.24s)]
*  They are fun. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8359.24s)]
*  All right. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8361.24s)]
*  So here. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8362.24s)]
*  Here's my thing with fat. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8363.24s)]
*  Let me tell you when I stopped at the fast. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8364.24s)]
*  I was a fast guy. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8367.24s)]
*  This is one of those weird moments. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8368.24s)]
*  I'm being dead honest. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8369.24s)]
*  Okay. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8370.24s)]
*  I just got my new car. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8371.24s)]
*  Swear to God. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8373.24s)]
*  All right. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8374.24s)]
*  I'm doing a gig. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8375.24s)]
*  I'm out and this freaked me out. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8376.24s)]
*  This is why. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8379.24s)]
*  So I go do the gig and as I'm driving back, it's about 1.30, 2 in the morning. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8381.24s)]
*  It's way out along the island and going back to Jersey because it's striking distance going [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8387.24s)]
*  back home. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8390.24s)]
*  As I'm in the left lane. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8391.24s)]
*  Okay. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8393.24s)]
*  Hit the rain. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8394.24s)]
*  It's dark. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8395.24s)]
*  I went with my friend Rob. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8396.24s)]
*  I'm flying. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8398.24s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8399.24s)]
*  I love going. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8400.24s)]
*  I'm hitting 90, 95. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8401.24s)]
*  To me that's awesome. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8402.24s)]
*  And it's raining? [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8403.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8404.24s)]
*  It's raining. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8405.24s)]
*  But it just finished raining and now I'm on the Jersey side. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8406.24s)]
*  And all my life. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8411.24s)]
*  As I'm driving. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8415.24s)]
*  But the inside goes, Jim, go in the middle lane. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8418.24s)]
*  I'm not talking about, dude. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8424.24s)]
*  And as I'm middle lane. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8426.24s)]
*  And he doesn't even know I'm having this conversation in my head. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8428.24s)]
*  I'm saying go to middle lane. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8431.24s)]
*  And it was not only the middle lane just because of the car. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8433.24s)]
*  Just slow down a life, Jim. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8437.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8439.24s)]
*  So this is my wackiness. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8440.24s)]
*  I go into the middle lane. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8441.24s)]
*  On my life, Joe. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8444.24s)]
*  On my life. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8446.24s)]
*  This freaked me out. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8447.24s)]
*  The second I got in that middle lane. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8448.24s)]
*  There was a car. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8450.24s)]
*  All the lights off. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8452.24s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8454.24s)]
*  In the left fucking lane. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8455.24s)]
*  Just sitting there. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8457.24s)]
*  And I went. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8459.24s)]
*  And the two of us went, holy shit. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8460.24s)]
*  Dude. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8462.24s)]
*  Dude, if we didn't fucking move to the middle lane we would have fucking hit that. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8463.24s)]
*  And then I noticed as we were going there was a bunch of cars on the side. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8466.24s)]
*  So I don't know what kind of accident broke out. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8469.24s)]
*  Dude, that. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8472.24s)]
*  I had the exact same experience. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8473.24s)]
*  That shit happens to me and I don't look at it as like nothing. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8474.24s)]
*  I had the exact same experience. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8477.24s)]
*  The exact same. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8478.24s)]
*  It was me and my friend John. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8479.24s)]
*  We were driving in New York. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8480.24s)]
*  And we were coming home from playing pool. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8481.24s)]
*  And I was in the second to left lane. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8483.24s)]
*  And I saw it up ahead because it had very dull hazard lights. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8486.24s)]
*  The battery was dead. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8491.24s)]
*  The hazard lights were very dull. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8492.24s)]
*  And I saw it. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8494.24s)]
*  And I went, oh shit. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8495.24s)]
*  And I changed lanes. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8496.24s)]
*  And then I looked behind me in the rear view mirror and I saw a car hit it. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8498.24s)]
*  Just full on. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8502.24s)]
*  Boom. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8503.24s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8504.24s)]
*  Spinning out of control. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8505.24s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8506.24s)]
*  Boom. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8507.24s)]
*  Another car hits. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8508.24s)]
*  We watched this fucking pylon happen right behind us. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8509.24s)]
*  Dude. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8511.24s)]
*  I. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8512.24s)]
*  What. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8513.24s)]
*  The fact of what. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8514.24s)]
*  I go far out there. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8515.24s)]
*  What made me at that moment say get in the middle lane. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8517.24s)]
*  I didn't even see it. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8521.24s)]
*  I didn't see the light. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8522.24s)]
*  So that's why I know you love the fast. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8524.24s)]
*  I don't have that adrenaline. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8527.24s)]
*  It freaks me out. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8528.24s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm not into doing that. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8529.24s)]
*  You don't understand. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8530.24s)]
*  I'm not into like going fast on the highway. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8531.24s)]
*  No, you know what? [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8532.24s)]
*  What I'm really interested in is input from a car. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8533.24s)]
*  I don't need to be going fast. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8537.24s)]
*  I like a car that looks like where I like muscle cars. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8538.24s)]
*  They give you input. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8540.24s)]
*  There's a field you have when you're riding them. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8541.24s)]
*  You don't have to ride them irresponsibly to enjoy it. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8543.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8545.24s)]
*  You're just you're connected to the machine. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8546.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8548.24s)]
*  It's just a different. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8549.24s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8550.24s)]
*  I got it. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8551.24s)]
*  It's just different. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8552.24s)]
*  I got it. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8553.24s)]
*  Sad. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8554.24s)]
*  I don't mean you should be driving irresponsibly. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8555.24s)]
*  You know, that's. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8557.24s)]
*  No, it's sad. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8558.24s)]
*  He's doing the thing. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8559.24s)]
*  The thing that he's doing. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8560.24s)]
*  He's really doing that on these open roads. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8561.24s)]
*  And he's going. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8563.24s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just that they close it down or he's got it down to a science. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8564.24s)]
*  I think he just goes really late at night. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8568.24s)]
*  I think that's the move. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8570.24s)]
*  I think if you're like a city dweller and you live in downtown L.A., there ain't shit [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8571.24s)]
*  going on there at night. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8576.24s)]
*  There's no one there at night. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8577.24s)]
*  Downtown L.A. is weird, dude. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8579.24s)]
*  It's weird because you think like downtown wherever New York City. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8581.24s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8585.24s)]
*  It's going to be hoppins, going to be restaurants and people. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8586.24s)]
*  Downtown L.A. is a zombie movie. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8589.24s)]
*  It's a full on zombie movie. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8592.24s)]
*  It's the craziest homeless population on Earth. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8594.24s)]
*  Still. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8597.24s)]
*  Oh, my God, dude. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8598.24s)]
*  If you ever been down to those side streets that are complete skid row, they're totally [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8599.24s)]
*  covered with people. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8606.24s)]
*  I saw it in like I was filming Fear Factor there in like 2003. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8607.24s)]
*  That's how far back it goes. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8613.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8614.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8615.24s)]
*  2003 there was skid row. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8616.24s)]
*  It's way before that. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8617.24s)]
*  There's a documentary on that hotel. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8618.24s)]
*  What's that hotel called again, Jimmy? [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8620.24s)]
*  The Cecil Hotel. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8621.24s)]
*  That was that hotel where a lady died. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8622.24s)]
*  They thought that someone had killed her, but she was off her medication. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8625.24s)]
*  She jumped into the tanks, the water tanks on the roof, and they found her in there. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8629.24s)]
*  So this is documentary they did on the Cecil Hotel. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8632.24s)]
*  And then it becomes this history of skid row. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8635.24s)]
*  And what skid row would be like, they would find people, degenerates, homeless people, [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8637.24s)]
*  drug addicts from one place, and they would just go take them and drop them off right [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8643.24s)]
*  in this one area where there's like a shelter and then there's food and keep them there. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8649.24s)]
*  And so they developed this like fucking internal village in Los Angeles that's all drug addict [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8653.24s)]
*  homeless people. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8661.24s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8662.24s)]
*  I'm talking thousands and thousands of people in this area. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8663.24s)]
*  I know, but we should put more money in climate change and help out there. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8668.24s)]
*  The fucked up thing about that is they engineered that. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8672.24s)]
*  They made that area. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8675.24s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8676.24s)]
*  They sent people to those spots. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8677.24s)]
*  And they had police that kept people from leaving that area. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8678.24s)]
*  You've been traveling. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8682.24s)]
*  Haven't you seen certain cities over the last couple years out of nowhere all of a sudden [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8683.24s)]
*  has a huge homeless population? [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8689.24s)]
*  Yeah, a lot. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8691.24s)]
*  Like this is not, this is in my opinion from traveling. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8692.24s)]
*  I remember Denver was one of the first places where I was like, what the? [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8697.24s)]
*  This happened quick. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8701.24s)]
*  Why are they all in Denver? [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8702.24s)]
*  And then Portland, I would see in LA, but not to the, I've been out of LA a long time. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8704.24s)]
*  So not to the extent that you have. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8712.24s)]
*  San Fran, the first time, my God, it was like 2017, 18. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8714.24s)]
*  I was traumatized what I saw in just a short amount of time. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8720.24s)]
*  It wasn't that crazy. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8725.24s)]
*  I don't remember it being that crazy. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8727.24s)]
*  2015 compared to 2017, 18. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8730.24s)]
*  It got insane. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8733.24s)]
*  It was, I saw a guy sticking a needle in. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8735.24s)]
*  I saw homeless people yelling at people. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8738.24s)]
*  They made it more convenient for them. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8740.24s)]
*  They made, they were more tolerant of them and they gave them money to stay there. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8743.24s)]
*  There's a lot of cities in the Pacific Northwest. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8748.24s)]
*  I don't know if it's Portland or Seattle. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8751.24s)]
*  One of them, they interviewed this guy and he was talking about how he gets a job. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8753.24s)]
*  He's talking about how he gets a check. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8756.24s)]
*  He gets a check every month. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8758.24s)]
*  And so it's like beneficial for him to stay on the street. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8759.24s)]
*  He doesn't have to do anything. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8762.24s)]
*  He can get his drugs and get his food and he just sleeps on the streets. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8763.24s)]
*  And they're paying them. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8766.24s)]
*  They're essentially paying them to never improve their condition. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8768.24s)]
*  Is that a vote? [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8770.24s)]
*  I doubt it. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8771.24s)]
*  I mean, maybe people voted out. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8772.24s)]
*  They're out of their mind. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8773.24s)]
*  But like, either way, what is, why do you put them there? [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8774.24s)]
*  Those people are in a fucking, those people are in a death cult. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8776.24s)]
*  They're in a suicide death cult. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8778.24s)]
*  They want their city to spiral out of control. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8780.24s)]
*  They want no cops. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8782.24s)]
*  But why? [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8783.24s)]
*  Trans kids everywhere. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8784.24s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8785.24s)]
*  There has to be a recent one. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8786.24s)]
*  China, TikTok, probably Russia. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8788.24s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8791.24s)]
*  I gotta pee. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8793.24s)]
*  I gotta pee really bad too. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8794.24s)]
*  We'll come back. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8795.24s)]
*  It just doesn't make sense. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8796.24s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8797.24s)]
*  It doesn't make sense that people are buying into it, right? [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8798.24s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8799.24s)]
*  I think there's a fucking game going on, Jim. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8800.24s)]
*  That game is total control of the human population. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8804.24s)]
*  It's the same game that's been going on since the British Empire. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8808.24s)]
*  The beginning of time. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8811.24s)]
*  The same game that went on when Portugal went to South America. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8812.24s)]
*  It's the same game that we've been doing forever. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8815.24s)]
*  The same game. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8818.24s)]
*  It's just being, it's being done on a different playing field. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8819.24s)]
*  It's a different world. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8823.24s)]
*  There's a different influence. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8825.24s)]
*  There's this whole digital thing that no one's completely got control of yet. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8826.24s)]
*  And there's a lot of AI talk, and we don't exactly know what the state of the art is. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8830.24s)]
*  It's shocking how good it is already. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8836.24s)]
*  So the other day, I don't know what it was, but over Florida, southwest Florida, my daughter [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8839.24s)]
*  and I were riding a bicycle. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8846.24s)]
*  You saw a UFO? [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8848.24s)]
*  No, it wasn't a UFO. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8850.24s)]
*  It was this. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8853.24s)]
*  Wait, it was... [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8854.24s)]
*  You saw that giant alien at the Miami Mall? [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8856.24s)]
*  No. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8859.24s)]
*  Dude. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8860.24s)]
*  Epstein's Island. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8861.24s)]
*  Can we send out the aliens, please, immediately? [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8862.24s)]
*  They were 10 foot Anunnaki. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8865.24s)]
*  It was 10 foot Anunnaki. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8867.24s)]
*  Where's the video? [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8869.24s)]
*  There's clear grainy video footage. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8870.24s)]
*  There's fucking high resolution cell phone footage of those kids beating the fuck out [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8872.24s)]
*  of people at that mall. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8877.24s)]
*  How many cameras are in a freaking mall? [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8878.24s)]
*  There's no cameras in a mall. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8882.24s)]
*  You don't have anyone video-tested? [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8883.24s)]
*  They don't work on aliens. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8885.24s)]
*  The cameras don't work. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8886.24s)]
*  Oh, you know what? [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8887.24s)]
*  That's what it's... [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8888.24s)]
*  No, so we're looking up in the... [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8889.24s)]
*  Damn it. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8891.24s)]
*  I had a friend of mine try to convince me that the aliens erased the video footage that he [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8892.24s)]
*  was getting of the flying saucer that was in his backyard. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8896.24s)]
*  Come on. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8899.24s)]
*  No, he really believed it. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8900.24s)]
*  No, so this was... [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8901.24s)]
*  I'm like, bro, you forgot to press record. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8902.24s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8905.24s)]
*  So, first... [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8908.24s)]
*  What is that? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8909.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8910.24s)]
*  That's what I'm asking you. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8911.24s)]
*  That looks like a launch. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8912.24s)]
*  So that could be either a missile test or that could be a satellite launch. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8914.24s)]
*  Where was that? [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8919.24s)]
*  You're near Cape Canaveral. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8920.24s)]
*  It's the Tesla thing. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8921.24s)]
*  SpaceX. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8922.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8923.24s)]
*  But here's what was wild. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8925.24s)]
*  So you're near Cape Canaveral, right? [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8926.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8928.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's what that is. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8929.24s)]
*  Okay, so... [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8930.24s)]
*  Did you Google rockets being launched that day? [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8931.24s)]
*  Or did you go straight to Reddit? [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8934.24s)]
*  No, no. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8936.24s)]
*  I knew... [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8937.24s)]
*  I was like, I'm not going to go on either one of these. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8938.24s)]
*  I just watched it. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8940.24s)]
*  And I just watched it, to be honest, because it formed a cloud and it looked like there [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8941.24s)]
*  was this weird cloud formation in the middle of the sky. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8947.24s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, there were two or three of them that started jetting out from [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8951.24s)]
*  each side. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8956.24s)]
*  I was like, oh, wow! [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8957.24s)]
*  But what blows my mind is when you look at it, as you say it's a rocket, it's moving, [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8959.24s)]
*  you see... [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8964.24s)]
*  It almost looks like... [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8965.24s)]
*  Whatever it's cutting through, you see it. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8968.24s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8971.24s)]
*  Well, that's just what it looks like. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8972.24s)]
*  If you're going through water, you're like, and you see the water. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8973.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8975.24s)]
*  Then if you're going through air, it's... [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8976.24s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8979.24s)]
*  But do you know why? [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8980.24s)]
*  No. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8981.24s)]
*  It's heat. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8982.24s)]
*  It's heat and condensation. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8983.24s)]
*  It's the same reason why you see contrails after jet engines. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8984.24s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8986.24s)]
*  So with jet engines, when they go to the sky and we say, oh my God, they're making fake [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8987.24s)]
*  clouds, they are making clouds. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8989.24s)]
*  Yes. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8991.24s)]
*  This is how they make clouds. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8992.24s)]
*  It's an accidental thing of having a very hot jet engine that's going through an area [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8993.24s)]
*  with a very specific amount of moisture in the air. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=8997.24s)]
*  When they travel through with a certain amount of humidity, a certain amount of moisture with [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9002.24s)]
*  the heat of the jet engine, it literally creates clouds. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9005.74s)]
*  And the thing is, when people say, oh, they're geoengineering, involuntarily, for sure. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9009.24s)]
*  Maybe they've done some stuff. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9015.24s)]
*  They've definitely cloud seeded and there definitely have been some experiments about [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9016.74s)]
*  lowering the temperature of the earth by seeding things in the clouds. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9020.24s)]
*  There's definitely been experiments and definitely been studies and discussions about that. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9024.24s)]
*  But one of the things that happens when you have all the jets flying back and forth like [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9029.24s)]
*  we do is you are 100% creating cloud cover that cools the earth. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9034.24s)]
*  They found that out during 9-11 because after 9-11, when they shut down all the airports, [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9039.24s)]
*  they shut down all the flights and there was no planes in the sky, the temperature got [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9043.24s)]
*  warmer. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9047.24s)]
*  And it's because they're literally covering us with clouds every time they go over in [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9048.24s)]
*  these jets. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9053.24s)]
*  That's what's happening. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9054.24s)]
*  So when you're looking at that, that's a similar version of that. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9056.24s)]
*  You're looking at this insanely powerful rocket that's shooting this satellite up into the [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9058.24s)]
*  sky. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9063.24s)]
*  There's a meteorologist's explanation of that. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9064.24s)]
*  Ice crystals come out of the spacecraft exhaust, wow, are beautiful and they glow whenever [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9066.24s)]
*  the sunlight hits them. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9070.24s)]
*  If we're in darkness but the sunlight is going right past the limb of the earth, then when [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9071.24s)]
*  those ice crystals are up there, they turn into this fantastic show. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9076.24s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9079.24s)]
*  So it's cold as fuck up there, dude. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9081.24s)]
*  You've got to realize, you ever look in a plane when it tells you the outside temperature? [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9084.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's like minus 33. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9088.24s)]
*  Yeah, what the fuck, dude? [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9090.24s)]
*  Minus six, it is freezing up there. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9091.24s)]
*  So when you're passing through that with a hot jet engine, you're basically making the [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9092.24s)]
*  equivalent of like if you go outside in the winter and go, right, right. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9096.24s)]
*  But you're doing it in a way more extreme version. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9100.24s)]
*  You're literally turning it into a cloud. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9102.24s)]
*  So who is that now? [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9105.24s)]
*  That's SpaceX. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9106.24s)]
*  I think that's SpaceX, which Jamie saw. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9108.24s)]
*  Yeah, I did see that. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9110.24s)]
*  A fucking door blew off an Alaska airline. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9111.24s)]
*  Did you see the other one with the plane crashed? [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9113.24s)]
*  What? [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9116.24s)]
*  Bro, this United one. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9117.24s)]
*  I don't even think this was the door they set. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9118.24s)]
*  It was next to the door. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9120.24s)]
*  Oh my God, it's just a chunk of the fucking, oh my God. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9122.24s)]
*  And the person didn't fly out? [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9124.24s)]
*  Maybe it was a dormant. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9126.24s)]
*  And no one flew out? [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9127.24s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9128.24s)]
*  No, it happened 20 minutes after they left and they're still, like they showed them flying. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9129.24s)]
*  They just found a phone. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9133.24s)]
*  Can you imagine sitting right there? [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9134.24s)]
*  Someone's iPhone fell out while they were up there. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9135.24s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9138.24s)]
*  And they found it. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9139.24s)]
*  Can you imagine sitting right there? [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9140.24s)]
*  It's still working. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9141.24s)]
*  It still worked? [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9142.24s)]
*  Yeah, the two people that were sitting there had missed the flight, they said. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9143.24s)]
*  Are you serious? [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9146.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9147.24s)]

*  Are they going through a similar thing? [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9226.24s)]
*  Were they just hiring anybody? [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9227.74s)]

*  And I think Schneider, I saw a split. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9236.24s)]
*  No, it was on the runway. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9239.24s)]

*  What a horror show. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9252.24s)]

*  through the now infamous 1972 crash of the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 banded together [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9328.48s)]

*  You're dealing with people that are in the fucking Air Force. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9352.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9354.48s)]

*  These are soldiers. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9361.4s)]
*  And so they banded together and they survived. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9362.960000000001s)]

*  Yes. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9427.4s)]
*  Is that the way? [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9428.4s)]
*  No, is that like the warrior? [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9429.4s)]
*  Yeah, before they do, holy shit, bro. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9430.4s)]
*  It's spooky. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9432.4s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9433.4s)]
*  Imagine making a thousand people invading your town doing that. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9434.4s)]
*  People would already lay down. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9438.96s)]
*  I don't want to fight these guys. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9439.96s)]
*  I'm out. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9440.96s)]
*  Imagine just looking like those Braveheart type wars. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9441.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9443.52s)]
*  We're looking at people on the other side. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9444.52s)]
*  I'm out. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9445.52s)]
*  Show me some of that, Jamie. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9446.52s)]
*  Show me some of that. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9447.52s)]
*  Yeah, this is rugby team. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9448.52s)]
*  Bro. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9449.52s)]
*  Now imagine these guys showed up. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9450.52s)]
*  These guys are animals. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9451.52s)]
*  We're going to fight. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9452.52s)]
*  They got all taped up ears and shit. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9453.52s)]
*  They're ready to go to war. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9454.52s)]
*  They're ready to go to war. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9455.52s)]
*  This is a totally different kind of game. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9456.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9458.52s)]
*  They don't got no pads on, man. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9459.52s)]
*  There's no pads. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9461.52s)]
*  No pads. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9462.52s)]
*  And these guys fucking collide with each other. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9464.52s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9467.0s)]
*  Town being all getting fired up. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9487.0s)]
*  Imagine this guy did this in the bars. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9489.12s)]
*  You're coming out. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9490.6s)]
*  He said the wrong thing. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9491.6s)]
*  Not good. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9493.08s)]
*  Not good. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9494.08s)]
*  Listen to that fucking crowd, dude. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9500.08s)]
*  That's not aggressive, is it? [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9507.08s)]
*  Walking up to the line like that? [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9508.08s)]
*  And that guy is crazy. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9512.08s)]
*  There was one dude in the back who was like, oh my god, what the fuck am I getting into? [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9524.08s)]
*  The main guy looks like he's going to bite something. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9530.08s)]
*  Bro. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9538.08s)]
*  The guy on the far left looks crazy. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9539.08s)]
*  And we're over here arguing about what gender can use what bathroom. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9541.08s)]
*  Crazy, right? [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9547.08s)]
*  They want us to fight over stupid shit. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9549.08s)]
*  I remember when it first came out. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9551.08s)]
*  They want us to become feminized. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9552.08s)]
*  They want us to become weaker. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9553.08s)]
*  They want us to become stupider. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9554.08s)]
*  They want us to become more docile, more dependent. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9555.08s)]
*  That's just how people are, kids. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9559.08s)]
*  It's dehumanizing. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9561.08s)]
*  You're dehumanizing. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9562.08s)]
*  Take out the spirit and what your existence is. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9564.08s)]
*  It is. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9568.08s)]
*  It's your true existence. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9569.08s)]
*  You're natural. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9570.08s)]
*  I think that's how things move. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9571.08s)]
*  I think that's how things progress. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9573.08s)]
*  You have to have a resistance to something's infringing and then you have to have a resistance [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9575.08s)]
*  and then things improve because you realize the power and the importance of this moment. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9580.08s)]
*  You have to overcome this as a society. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9585.08s)]
*  We have to overcome this. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9588.08s)]
*  But we have to be forced into this conflict to be able to rise to overcome it. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9589.08s)]
*  I think that's what's happened all throughout history with wars. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9594.08s)]
*  This is a kind of a war. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9598.08s)]
*  It's kind of a culture war. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9600.08s)]
*  Psychological. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9601.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9602.08s)]
*  The culture war is attached to physical wars. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9603.08s)]
*  It can manipulate those physical wars. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9606.08s)]
*  It's real. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9608.08s)]
*  It's real wars. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9609.08s)]
*  It's wild times, kids. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9610.08s)]
*  It really is. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9611.08s)]
*  This is the wildest of times. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9612.08s)]
*  And we just got to hope that cooler heads prevail and no one decides to get nuclear. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9614.08s)]
*  No one decides to get Oppenheimer up in this bitch. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9620.08s)]
*  That's what I don't understand too. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9623.08s)]
*  I remember last time I was here, people, just everyday people, how hard is it? [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9627.08s)]
*  Why do we allow if they say, hey man, Russia's a problem. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9633.08s)]
*  Ukraine, Israel, or whatever conflict there is, how come you never just talk to the people? [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9638.08s)]
*  Why do you have to talk to the ones? [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9645.08s)]
*  But why can't you? [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9647.08s)]
*  Who is allowing this? [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9648.08s)]
*  Why do we allow this? [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9649.08s)]
*  Why do we allow your entire existence to be controlled by someone that can force one of [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9651.08s)]
*  your children or yourself into a situation they have nothing to do with? [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9659.08s)]
*  Sure. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9666.08s)]
*  But you're not talking about murdering them or teaching them to murder. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9667.08s)]
*  Well, that's definitely the argument against the draft, right? [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9670.08s)]
*  The draft is you're taking people against their will and you're forcing them to fight [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9673.08s)]
*  for their country against a war that may ultimately prove to be unjustified. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9678.08s)]
*  Who says it's justified? [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9682.08s)]
*  Think about the people that got drafted for the Vietnam War. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9683.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9686.08s)]
*  Now, if that's not a- [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9687.08s)]
*  That's the best example that we have because it's universally regarded as being started [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9688.08s)]
*  by a false flag. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9692.08s)]
*  And probably it was a part of a fucking crazy drug money operation. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9694.08s)]
*  At least part of it. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9699.08s)]
*  That was a genocide. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9700.08s)]
*  And that's another thing when you sit and you really think about it. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9702.08s)]
*  That's really scary when you say that was here to send people in a situation that you [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9708.08s)]
*  know, there was times where they knew it wasn't going to work out, but you keep selling them [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9714.08s)]
*  and then they drugged everyone here. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9718.08s)]
*  You can see all the implanted chaos and what they were doing. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9720.08s)]
*  If you're not educated, well, then you're going to have to go fight. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9727.08s)]
*  And if you don't have money, well, then you're going to have to go fight. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9732.08s)]
*  Okay, if you're going to stay here, let's start the camps. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9736.08s)]
*  Let's start dropping all these drugs. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9739.08s)]
*  Let's put out this genre of music. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9741.08s)]
*  Let's make sure this music starts really kicking in. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9743.08s)]
*  That's the weird conspiracy theory. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9746.08s)]
*  The Hollywood or the CIA. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9748.08s)]
*  The CIA created a lot of rock and roll. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9750.08s)]
*  That's a weird one. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9754.08s)]
*  Why is it that weird? [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9755.08s)]
*  That's just weird. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9756.08s)]
*  Not saying that it's not true. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9758.08s)]
*  Get them on every level, entertainment and everything. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9760.08s)]
*  It's just like to a degree sports or something like that. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9762.08s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9766.08s)]
*  But it's not possible to create something like the doors without insane talent and dedication. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9767.08s)]
*  You have to have a bunch of things that have to be happening. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9774.08s)]
*  So how much influence do they really have? [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9777.08s)]
*  I mean, how much influence do they really have where they can create Light My Fire? [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9780.08s)]
*  Who creates the airwaves? [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9786.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9788.08s)]
*  I mean, the actual recording itself is brilliant. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9789.08s)]
*  Break On Through to the Other Side is a fucking brilliant song. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9793.08s)]
*  It's a brilliant song. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9797.08s)]
*  It's one of those songs where it brings you back to the year in which it was made. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9799.08s)]
*  You feel it in the song. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9805.08s)]
*  It's like a time capsule. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9807.08s)]
*  That song is magic. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9808.08s)]
*  So if the CIA really did create rock and roll, the CIA really was involved in the hippie movement. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9810.08s)]
*  How much were they involved in the magic that was the doors? [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9815.08s)]
*  And can you do that again, please? [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9820.08s)]
*  Were you guys really involved in Hendrix? [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9823.08s)]
*  Because that's the thing. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9825.08s)]
*  They always said like Hendrix. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9826.08s)]
*  Hendrix was like a product of the CIA. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9827.08s)]
*  I'd heard that. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9829.08s)]
*  Like how? [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9830.08s)]
*  How did you make the greatest guitarist of all time? [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9831.08s)]
*  Do it again, please. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9833.08s)]
*  What did you do? [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9834.08s)]
*  And for what? [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9835.08s)]
*  You know the latest one? [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9836.08s)]
*  No, but I'm starting here. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9837.08s)]
*  The latest one is rap music. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9838.08s)]
*  The latest one is the CIA created Gangsta Rap to cause chaos in the communities. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9839.08s)]
*  I'll tap that entertainment and thought because if you think about it, I was a metal guy. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9846.08s)]
*  I don't know what kind of music you were into. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9851.08s)]
*  So I was very like, hey, listen, this is crap. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9853.08s)]
*  Black people singing, trying to steal. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9857.08s)]
*  That's the mentality. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9860.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9862.08s)]
*  Of where I grew up and the music and da da da. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9863.08s)]
*  And so but then all the chicks started listening to hip hop. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9867.08s)]
*  I'm going to break my heart. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9870.08s)]
*  You see like dudes breakdance. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9871.08s)]
*  I'm like, oh, dude, you're going to the other side. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9873.08s)]
*  So it was kind of it was breaking out and it was becoming it was crossing over. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9875.08s)]
*  It was also I wouldn't say harmless, but it's more upbeat. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9881.08s)]
*  And so if you're any music that influences both sides, [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9886.08s)]
*  always has to eventually get get get steered in a certain direction or another direction. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9891.08s)]
*  That's just my own thought. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9899.08s)]
*  And if you look at all like tremendous people that would start crossing over like, oh, yeah, stop this. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9901.08s)]
*  He's singing about whether I even thought that sometimes about some of the deeper metal bands like these guys were talking. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9907.08s)]
*  These guys running around acting all violent, smash each other, talking about Creepin' Death and Consolidation Starling. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9915.08s)]
*  Don't tell you. Pretty round up. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9922.08s)]
*  So you're saying that someone's like controlling who makes it through and who doesn't? [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9923.08s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9926.08s)]
*  Why wouldn't it? [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9928.08s)]
*  Why would you allow certain individuals or certain music to get out there? [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9929.08s)]
*  And then if it gets out there, anything that can control. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9936.08s)]
*  Well, first of all, that much has to be monitored. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9940.08s)]
*  Well, first of all, when someone's making music, right in the beginning, you're not making any money. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9943.08s)]
*  So you've got to get really good to the point where you're an artist who makes amazing music for you to be popular at all. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9948.08s)]
*  If you can't fake it, you think that people faked it a little bit with like some pop songs. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9955.08s)]
*  There's some they put together some bullshit for sure. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9960.08s)]
*  But if you're talking about like classic rock, that shit was not fake. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9963.08s)]
*  They figured they tapped into some kind of creativity. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9967.08s)]
*  And I don't think people anticipated that. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9971.08s)]
*  I don't think that existed before. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9974.08s)]
*  I think the difference between 1950s rock and 1960s rock is the Grand Canyon. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9976.08s)]
*  It's crazy how different it is. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9982.08s)]
*  You go from fucking Buddy Holly to Led Zeppelin. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9984.08s)]
*  What? You know, you go from been a long time since we rock and roll. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9988.08s)]
*  Like you listen to that kind of music like, holy shit. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9992.08s)]
*  And then you go just to the 1950s and, you know, you have good music, you have fun songs. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=9995.08s)]
*  But they're kind of simplistic, man. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10000.08s)]
*  There's there's something about the drug culture and the drug culture influence on music. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10002.08s)]
*  The psychedelic culture influence on music in the 1960s is substantial, whether it's what happened with the Beatles, [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10008.08s)]
*  what happened with for sure what happened with many, many, many, many bands, many bands. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10015.08s)]
*  Jimi Hendrix, absolutely. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10022.08s)]
*  The Doors, absolutely. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10024.08s)]
*  There's so many classical bands that were experimenting with LSD. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10026.08s)]
*  You know, they're hanging out with Ken Kesey. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10031.08s)]
*  You know, there's there's been a lot of those bands that were doing like they were doing wild shit, man. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10034.08s)]
*  So do you think because sometimes I'll think, well, they were whacked or they had to be taken out [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10040.08s)]
*  because they were freeing too many minds or the motions. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10045.08s)]
*  I think they live in a lifestyle for the most part. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10049.08s)]
*  I mean, the Kurt Cobain one is kind of crazy. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10051.08s)]
*  What's that? You know, committed suicide. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10053.08s)]
*  And then there's a whole conspiracy that he was actually murdered. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10055.08s)]
*  There was a documentary that was like a docu drama where they had someone like playing the cop and, you know, the whole deal. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10058.08s)]
*  And it's sort of trying to paint this story that he was assassinated. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10065.08s)]
*  But at the very least, the guy was doing heroin all the time and was probably suicidal. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10069.08s)]
*  And a lot of the deaths you're talking about guys like Jim Morrison, [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10077.08s)]
*  you like fucking choked to death on his own vomit, man. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10081.08s)]
*  Same with Hendrix. The Hendrix one is kind of crazy because one of Hendrix's old bodyguards apparently had [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10083.08s)]
*  he was saying that Hendrix was killed by his manager, that he was about to leave his manager. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10090.08s)]
*  So Hendrix manager killed him and he controlled the rights to all of his music. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10095.08s)]
*  Now, is that that far fetched? [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10099.08s)]
*  It's not that far fetched because the mob was running music back then. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10101.08s)]
*  Just like the mob was running Vegas. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10105.08s)]
*  The mob was running New York City. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10107.08s)]
*  It wasn't like you're dealing with people at CAA. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10109.08s)]
*  You know, you're dealing with some incredibly unethical, dangerous people that live in the world of live entertainment. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10114.08s)]
*  Wild drug using people. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10120.08s)]
*  Like that guy Phil Spector that killed that lady. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10122.08s)]
*  He put a gun in that lady's mouth and shot her in the head. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10125.08s)]
*  And he picked her up. She was like a waitress in Hollywood. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10129.08s)]
*  He brought her back to his mansion and shot her in the mouth. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10132.08s)]
*  And apparently he pulled guns on people all the time, just point his gun at people. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10134.08s)]
*  This is the guy that produced, he's the wall of sound guy. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10138.08s)]
*  He's the guy that produced so much incredible music. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10141.08s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of great producers that supposedly have these dark, dark edges. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10144.08s)]
*  It's like an organized type crime, whatever that falls into. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10151.08s)]
*  They're probably doing pounds of blow, dude. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10155.08s)]
*  They're probably doing pounds of blow. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10157.08s)]
*  As long as this table. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10160.08s)]
*  There's no way a guy who puts guns in people's mouths, not doing blow. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10162.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10166.08s)]
*  You're right. 100% not smoking weed. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10167.08s)]
*  That guy's doing blow. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10169.08s)]
*  That guy's definitely on something outside of it. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10171.08s)]
*  He's out of his fucking mind on blow. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10174.08s)]
*  That's far out, bro. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10176.08s)]
*  He's out of his mind on blow. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10177.08s)]
*  And he would wear wacky wigs. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10179.08s)]
*  He was bald, but he would wear these crazy wigs. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10181.08s)]
*  Like crazy, like Afro wigs. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10184.08s)]
*  You ever seen his wigs? [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10186.08s)]
*  No. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10187.08s)]
*  He changes wigs all the time when he's in court. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10188.08s)]
*  Who's the guy? [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10189.08s)]
*  Phil Spector. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10191.08s)]
*  Yes. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10192.08s)]
*  See if you can find out the Phil Spector's different wigs that he wore. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10193.08s)]
*  Look at it. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10197.08s)]
*  So this is during his trial. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10198.08s)]
*  Imagine you want people to think you're not guilty and you literally dress like a Willy [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10200.08s)]
*  Wonka character. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10204.08s)]
*  Look at the pictures of this guy. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10206.08s)]
*  Different wigs. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10208.08s)]
*  So how many different wigs did he wear during the trial? [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10210.08s)]
*  He got a crazy power trip, lost his mind. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10212.08s)]
*  Yeah, he was an evil man. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10215.08s)]
*  Lost his mind. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10217.08s)]
*  Yeah, he lost his mind. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10218.08s)]
*  I shouldn't say lost his mind. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10219.08s)]
*  It was lost before he entered this realm. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10221.08s)]
*  But you also have to realize this guy was a music producer, again, back in the 1960s, [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10223.08s)]
*  man. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10228.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10229.08s)]
*  Like who was he dealing with? [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10230.08s)]
*  What kind of organized crime figures were involved in music back then? [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10231.08s)]
*  How gangster was that business? [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10235.08s)]
*  How much did they have control over those artists back then? [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10236.08s)]

*  The first time he's never heard? [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10391.08s)]
*  I don't know if he's Jamaican or whatever. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10393.08s)]
*  Oh. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10396.08s)]

*  Oh, yeah, there's a bunch of those. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10400.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10401.08s)]
*  Online, on YouTube. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10402.08s)]
*  I love watching that. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10403.08s)]
*  So this guy, man, he never made it. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10404.08s)]
*  So what happened to him? [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10406.08s)]
*  He's gone. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10407.08s)]
*  How many albums did he make? [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10408.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10409.08s)]
*  The thing is, the other music wasn't as good. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10410.08s)]
*  That music was magic. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10413.08s)]
*  I feel like if he was working with the right people, that guy's a bad motherfucker. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10415.08s)]
*  That song's so good. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10420.08s)]
*  I've listened to that song a thousand times. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10422.08s)]
*  Every time I listen to it, it just brings me back to 1969. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10424.08s)]
*  I just imagine that dude on stage singing that song, and I see all those people dancing. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10427.08s)]
*  That song was fire. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10432.08s)]
*  It was fire. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10435.08s)]
*  He just nailed it. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10436.08s)]
*  And he just, I don't think he ever did it again. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10437.08s)]
*  I mean, I never heard another song that connected with me that he did. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10439.08s)]
*  I might be wrong. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10442.08s)]
*  I haven't heard all of them. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10443.08s)]
*  Maybe he did another one like that. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10445.08s)]
*  Well, I remember we were really into Johnny Cash growing up. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10447.08s)]
*  And I remember after I saw the movie, then I realized he had a TV series. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10451.08s)]
*  Johnny Cash had a TV series? [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10457.08s)]
*  Yes! [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10459.08s)]
*  What was it? [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10460.08s)]
*  It was called The Johnny Cash Show and it was on TV. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10461.08s)]
*  Oh, I remember this now. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10464.08s)]
*  And, bro, can we see what that looked like? [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10466.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10469.08s)]
*  The Johnny Cash Show. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10470.08s)]
*  And the whole story behind the man in black and he would, in one show, hold on a second. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10473.08s)]
*  But the first thing I recognized was, yeah. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10481.08s)]
*  Yeah! [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10485.08s)]
*  And I can't remember if it was live or... [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10491.08s)]
*  Was this in Nashville? [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10496.08s)]
*  I don't know to be honest with you. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10498.08s)]
*  Wow, look at this. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10499.08s)]
*  But he also... [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10502.08s)]
*  What a bad motherfucker he was. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10511.08s)]
*  He would talk. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10513.08s)]
*  No, dude, when he would talk to the crowd, he would get into some deep stuff and interact with the crowd. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10514.08s)]
*  And then the music, whoever he had on musical.ly, which what I noticed was it wasn't about their outfits. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10520.08s)]
*  It wasn't, well, she went so much. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10528.08s)]
*  The chicks that sang, no one's crawling on the floor and tweaking. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10529.08s)]
*  It's the song. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10534.08s)]
*  It's the beauty of the song. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10537.08s)]
*  It's the spirit of the song. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10540.08s)]
*  Like, look, this chick in... [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10542.08s)]
*  Is that his wife? [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10543.08s)]
*  Who is that? [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10549.08s)]
*  Is this the pilot for the show? [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10550.08s)]
*  That's what it says. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10551.08s)]
*  1965. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10552.08s)]
*  Bro, and then he... [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10554.08s)]
*  This is crazy too. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10555.08s)]
*  He just wanted to sing gospel his whole life. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10557.08s)]
*  And they were like, yeah, you're not doing that. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10562.08s)]
*  And that's what I picked up from the movie. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10564.08s)]
*  There was a scene where he goes to the producers or the record company. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10566.08s)]
*  Like, yeah, no, we're not. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10570.08s)]
*  Come back, wait, and he came back with something. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10571.08s)]
*  Like, all right, we'll play that. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10573.08s)]
*  That will get on it. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10575.08s)]
*  But on here, he went full blown gospel on show and he went live and they threatened [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10576.08s)]
*  to pull him and all that. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10584.08s)]
*  That guy was a badass. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10585.08s)]
*  He was a pioneer. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10588.08s)]
*  But the music, it was more about the music compared to whatever's going on today. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10589.08s)]
*  Well, there's some people out here that are just doing the music too. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10596.08s)]
*  There's people out there, and they're very popular too because they're just doing music. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10598.08s)]

*  There's a lot of that now. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10604.08s)]
*  Guys like Zach Bryan. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10605.08s)]
*  People flock to that, dude, because it's just music. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10607.08s)]
*  It's just music. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10610.08s)]
*  There's no antics. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10611.08s)]
*  It's just him writing amazing songs and singing them beautifully. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10612.08s)]
*  And there's a bunch of those people out there right now. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10615.08s)]

*  With who? [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10625.08s)]
*  It's one of my favorite Johnny Cash songs. [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10626.08s)]
*  It's Johnny Cash with Waylon Jennings. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10627.08s)]

*  And when I reach the other side, I mean, it's fucking amazing. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10645.08s)]
*  It's an amazing song. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10649.08s)]
*  They just, they tapped into something, man. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10651.08s)]
*  They did. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10654.08s)]
*  But what my point is about the CIA creating the 1960s music, listen. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10655.08s)]
*  They might have helped those people and influenced those people and wanted degenerate people to reach the pinnacle of success so it would ruin society. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10659.08s)]
*  That's totally possible that they got behind that. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10667.08s)]
*  But also, they didn't create Hendrix. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10670.08s)]
*  Hendrix created Hendrix. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10673.08s)]
*  They might have allowed him to do that and almost pushed him because they wanted the moral decay of society so they could go in and close loopholes and put rules in place. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10674.08s)]
*  One of the things they did in 1970, there's a sweeping psychedelics act of 1970. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10684.08s)]
*  And they did that in response to the 60s movement. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10688.08s)]
*  And it made all psychedelic drugs illegal. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10691.08s)]
*  They all became schedule one. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10694.08s)]
*  So if you wanted to stop a society from waking up, that's what you do. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10695.08s)]
*  You go in and you promote the most insane behavior like the Manson family. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10700.08s)]
*  Like it was really detailed in the chaos book by Tom O'Neill. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10706.08s)]
*  You promote the most egregious offensive versions of the hippie culture. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10710.08s)]
*  You get them hooked on acid. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10715.08s)]
*  You make them commit violent crimes. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10716.08s)]
*  And you're doing this all so that you could eventually pass laws to limit all psychedelic use and all control over populations. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10718.08s)]
*  Stop all this hippie bullshit. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10728.08s)]
*  Lock those people up. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10730.08s)]
*  They did it with the civil rights movement. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10731.08s)]
*  They did it with the Black Panthers. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10733.08s)]
*  They did it with the hippies. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10734.08s)]
*  They infiltrated. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10735.08s)]
*  They got they changed the drug laws. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10737.08s)]
*  They use it as an excuse to come in and arrest people. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10739.08s)]
*  And they even had people pretending to be hippies that were deeply embedded in the movement, just like they did with the Proud Boys. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10742.08s)]
*  Of course. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10748.08s)]
*  Just like they did with those guys who was kidnapping Governor Whitmer. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10749.08s)]
*  That's what they do. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10751.08s)]
*  They infiltrate, get people to do things. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10752.08s)]
*  And it's all about control. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10754.08s)]
*  And through that, they've put the enlightenment of the human race on pause because they limited the use of these things that people have used forever to attain a level of enlightenment that they feel is unavailable. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10756.08s)]
*  To them without these experiences. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10771.08s)]
*  And we've denied them those experiences because we say we know better. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10772.08s)]
*  We've denied them those experiences because these are drugs and they're against the law. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10776.08s)]
*  And we wrote it down in 1970. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10779.08s)]
*  And by golly, we're sticking to it. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10781.08s)]
*  And that's just control. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10783.08s)]
*  That's all that is. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10786.08s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10787.08s)]
*  There's no logic behind any of that shit. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10788.08s)]
*  That's nonsense. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10791.08s)]
*  And the people that are making those laws, they've never even had those experiences. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10792.08s)]
*  So they don't even know what the fuck they're talking about. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10795.08s)]
*  Yeah, you're 100 percent on it because my daughter turned me on to a documentary where the guy was like an LSD guy and something where alcoholics basically people would see or have a spiritual awakening. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10799.08s)]
*  Yeah, people with addiction problems have cured it. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10818.08s)]
*  Like cigarette smokers that are addicted to cigarettes, people that are addicted to heroin, a lot of different people that have been addicted to things. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10820.08s)]
*  That, psilocybin has done that too. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10827.08s)]
*  But Ibogaine is the big one. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10830.08s)]
*  Ibogaine is the one where people get hooked on opiates and they get on Ibogaine and it fucking knocks it right out of them. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10832.08s)]
*  There was a guy I ran into about a month ago and he's down in Naples, Florida. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10838.08s)]
*  He was a veteran, I guess. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10844.08s)]
*  And he said, hey, I help veterans. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10846.08s)]
*  I don't know much about it. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10850.08s)]
*  But he mentioned, I said, what did you say? [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10851.08s)]
*  He's like something psychedelic. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10853.08s)]
*  He goes, yeah, we do psychedelic treatment and we're curing a lot of veterans and I can't vouch for that. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10855.08s)]
*  No, they're definitely doing that. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10860.08s)]
*  But it fascinated me. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10862.08s)]
*  And he said, yeah, they'll find God or they'll face their worst, the PTSD or whatever. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10863.08s)]
*  And I don't know this for a fact. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10870.08s)]
*  I have no clue and I don't want to say, yeah, but this dude told me. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10871.08s)]
*  It's MAPS. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10874.08s)]
*  MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Science or Psychedelic Medicine or whatever the S is. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10875.08s)]
*  But I was fascinated. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10881.08s)]
*  I mean, he was dead serious. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10883.08s)]
*  No, they do it. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10884.08s)]
*  They do it with a lot of different soldiers, specifically with MDMA. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10885.08s)]
*  They use it on soldiers and they've done a bunch of different studies and shown that it has a profound effect on them. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10888.08s)]
*  So what is the, so what is it? [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10896.08s)]
*  Is it bringing them to a euphoria or is it bringing them to, wow, there's so much more to meaning of life? [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10900.08s)]
*  Where does it push them? [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10906.08s)]
*  Well, I think it depends entirely on their intention going into something like that. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10907.08s)]
*  But you're going into this to try to alleviate PTSD and try to become at peace with your existence. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10911.08s)]
*  And for a lot of them, that's really hard to tell someone to go to war and kill people and then come back and just chill and be normal. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10918.08s)]
*  That's really hard. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10925.08s)]
*  And no one understands that other than them. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10926.08s)]
*  Everybody else just takes it for granted. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10929.08s)]
*  Correct. They don't understand. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10931.08s)]
*  And the fact that they don't do anything to help these people in that way, if there's a thing that you could do, whether it was ayahuasca, whether it's Ibogaine, [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10932.08s)]
*  whether it's anything, this is a thing you can do that can help those folks. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10940.08s)]
*  And you know it's available and you won't do it for some wacky reason because some corrupt politicians wrote it down in 1970. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10943.08s)]
*  That's insane. We know too much now. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10950.08s)]
*  We know too much for it to be wasting any time. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10953.08s)]
*  There's people that are committing suicide every day. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10957.08s)]
*  There's veterans that are taking their own lives that could be helped. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10959.08s)]
*  That's a fact. That's real. That's happening right now. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10961.08s)]
*  And the people that are keeping that experience from those people have no understanding of it. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10964.08s)]
*  They have never experienced it themselves. If they did, they would never keep it from people. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10969.08s)]
*  To me, that's the crime. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10973.08s)]
*  They would never keep it from people. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10974.08s)]
*  If you've had a breakthrough psychedelic experience and you know what it can do to you and how it can change the way you view the world, [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10976.08s)]
*  you would not want to stop that from happening to someone else. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10983.08s)]
*  The only time I would ever want to stop that from happening to someone else is if someone has a psychological condition that makes them fragile. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10986.08s)]
*  Maybe they're schizophrenic. Maybe they've got something else going on. Maybe they're on medication. They can't do any psychedelic. [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10992.08s)]
*  There's people like that that are real. You've got to know. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10997.08s)]
*  But the only way you know is if that stuff's legal. [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=10998.08s)]
*  And if they do studies and if they really understand the correct dosage and you get it done at places where there are legitimate professionals and counselors and people know what to do. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11000.08s)]
*  That's possible, man. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11010.08s)]
*  And that could literally help elevate us out of this fucking crazy mess we're in right now. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11012.08s)]
*  Yes. [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11017.08s)]
*  It would be the best way for people to wake up and realize these insane destructive patterns that we're all in. [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11018.08s)]
*  It's nuts that that's still going on. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11024.08s)]
*  It is nuts that it's still going on. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11027.08s)]
*  And then yet you'd be the first to send them without even thinking about something like that. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11029.08s)]
*  I think it's a race of connectivity and control. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11033.08s)]
*  They both happen at the same time. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11037.08s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11038.08s)]
*  Where the human race is getting more connected with each other than ever before. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11039.08s)]
*  There's a new Samsung Galaxy phone that's coming out. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11042.08s)]
*  It's the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Is that what it is? [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11045.08s)]
*  Yeah, S24 Ultra. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11050.08s)]
*  So what this phone can do that no other phone has ever been able to do is it translates things in real time. [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11053.08s)]
*  So you'll be able to talk to someone who's speaking Spanish and you'll have your phone out and you'll have earbuds in. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11059.08s)]
*  And it'll translate in real time what that person's saying. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11066.08s)]
*  And then it will do the same from you to them. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11071.08s)]
*  Wow, that's pretty sick. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11074.08s)]
*  Pretty sick. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11076.08s)]
*  In real time, you and I, if you spoke English and I spoke Spanish, we would have a conversation in real time. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11077.08s)]
*  And you'd be able to explain to me what you're talking about and I would understand it immediately. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11083.08s)]
*  That's amazing. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11087.08s)]
*  It's amazing. So this is a part of Samsung's new AI that they're unveiling. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11088.08s)]
*  So like Samsung has to compete with Apple, right? [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11093.08s)]
*  Because Apple is the number one phone for like most of the people that I know. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11096.08s)]
*  And you get caught up in the Apple ecosystem, which is like iMessage and iPhoto and all your shit goes together and your notes all get synced up. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11102.08s)]
*  But the problem with that is then you have one company that you rely on for everything. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11110.08s)]
*  The positive thing is they control the hardware, they control the software, they control everything. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11115.08s)]
*  The negative side is that you don't have any choices. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11119.08s)]
*  You just can only buy iPhones. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11123.08s)]
*  But when you're out in the Android side, there's like a hundred different manufacturers and they're all competing to make the best shit. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11125.08s)]
*  And so there's like this constant pressure to get something that's so sexy that it makes people abandon the Apple ecosystem. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11130.08s)]
*  And so they're all, it's a mad race for power. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11138.08s)]
*  And the Samsung Galaxy S24 is the new one. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11142.08s)]
*  Details emerge on Johnny Ive and OpenAI's plan to build the iPhone of artificial intelligence. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11145.08s)]
*  Oh, they're going to kill us all. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11151.08s)]
*  There's been over like 20 Apple engineers or developers left and went to that and gone to join this company. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11152.08s)]
*  Oh my God, we're fucked. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11158.08s)]
*  So but what's interesting about this Samsung phone is that might be a way to get people out of the ecosystem. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11159.08s)]
*  If you could be the first to implement something like that, it's a real time translation. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11166.08s)]
*  Imagine that you go to Italy, wherever, anywhere, anywhere, go to a tribe anywhere. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11171.08s)]
*  Well, I don't know. That would be tough. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11176.08s)]
*  There's some undocumented languages. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11178.08s)]
*  If you go into like indigenous Australia, there's hundreds of languages. [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11180.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11184.08s)]
*  My buddy Adam Green she was explaining that to me. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11185.08s)]
*  Yeah, those are the people that live there. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11187.08s)]
*  They call them. They call their group mobs. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11190.08s)]
*  OK, so there's mobs, these aborigines that are just 30 kilometers away from another mob and they don't even know how to talk to each other. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11193.08s)]
*  Wow. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11199.08s)]
*  They speak a totally different language. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11200.08s)]
*  Well, that makes sense. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11201.08s)]
*  Yeah. And there's hundreds of these different languages. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11202.08s)]
*  So if you go over there with a phone, you're fucked. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11203.08s)]
*  I got you. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11205.08s)]
*  Because nobody knows. [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11206.08s)]
*  But that's just for now. For now, nobody knows. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11207.08s)]
*  Correct. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11209.08s)]
*  But I bet AI will figure it out. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11210.08s)]
*  I bet they'll get a bunch of fucking those people to talk into it and they'll just decode it and decipher it and figure out what it means. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11212.08s)]
*  Yeah, or they already figured out. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11217.08s)]
*  I'm going to slowly give you first. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11219.08s)]
*  Give them this one where they can talk to someone from France. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11220.08s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to get France. [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11223.08s)]
*  You're going to get German. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11225.08s)]
*  You're going to get people speaking. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11226.08s)]
*  Yeah, Spanish will be the Spanish should be number one. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11228.08s)]
*  Right. Because that like behind English, that's the second language. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11231.08s)]
*  You're going to get the Arabic languages. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11234.08s)]
*  You're going to get Portuguese. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11235.08s)]
*  It's going to be interesting, man. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11237.08s)]
*  But it's going to happen in real time. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11239.08s)]
*  That's a new thing. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11241.08s)]
*  Once people can talk to each other in real time. [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11242.08s)]
*  Like that's one of the cool things about translate. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11245.08s)]
*  Like if you look at someone's tweet and you could press that translate button. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11247.08s)]
*  Yes. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11250.08s)]
*  So someone who's speaking Hebrew, you translate it. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11251.08s)]
*  You're like, oh, this is what he's saying. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11253.08s)]
*  Yes. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11254.08s)]
*  No, I agree. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11255.08s)]
*  Now, if you can have conversations, deep conversation with someone you've never met. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11256.08s)]
*  The only thing kept you from one another is not knowing each other's language. [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11260.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11264.08s)]
*  That's pretty amazing. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11265.08s)]
*  This is in the Bible. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11266.08s)]
*  This is the Tower of Babel. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11267.08s)]
*  This is what the Tower of Babel story is. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11269.08s)]
*  I think it's supposed to be the lesson is supposed to be about human, human, whether it's ego or greed. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11274.08s)]
*  The idea is that God decided to confuse people by making them speak a bunch of different languages so they can never talk to each other. [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11284.08s)]
*  It's because they tried to build a tower that touched the heavens. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11293.08s)]
*  Am I fucking that up? [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11297.08s)]
*  You got it. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11299.08s)]
*  What is the actual thing? [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11300.08s)]
*  I mean, I was... [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11301.08s)]
*  That is it? [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11302.08s)]
*  Yeah, look, there's the picture. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11303.08s)]
*  There it is. [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11304.08s)]
*  Okay. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11305.08s)]
*  So God's like, you motherfuckers, I'm going to fuck with you and make you build a bunch of different languages, you idiots. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11306.08s)]
*  So according to the story, a united human race speaking a single language and migrating eastward comes to the land of Shinar, where they agreed to build a city and a tower with its top in the sky. [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11312.08s)]
*  Yahweh, observing their city and tower, confounds their speech so that they can no longer understand each other and scatters them around the world. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11322.08s)]
*  So what that might mean, the Bible, if you're thinking about it, it's a written account of the last catastrophe and the people that made it out of the last catastrophe. [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11329.08s)]
*  So if at one point in time, before the catastrophe, there was a single language that was spoken, because they had reached this ability in terms of whether it's education or some kind of technology that allowed people to communicate with each other freely where everybody could speak. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11341.08s)]
*  And then when the asteroid hits, boom, and civilization goes back in the Stone Age, people scatter and then new languages develop. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11357.08s)]
*  People forget the old languages. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11365.08s)]
*  They run into people that have never even experienced it. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11367.08s)]
*  They travel around the world and repopulate the earth and everyone forgets the universal language. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11369.08s)]
*  I can see that happening. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11374.08s)]
*  It's totally possible. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11377.08s)]
*  Think about the old, we don't even know what ancient Sumerians sounded like. [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11378.08s)]
*  They just guess. [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11383.08s)]
*  Have you ever seen how they used to write 6,000 years ago? [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11384.08s)]
*  Even telecommunicating? [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11388.08s)]
*  Have you ever seen it? [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11389.08s)]
*  No. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11390.08s)]
*  It's called cuneiform. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11391.08s)]
*  It looks like old time nails, like a nail going sideways and two nails going down. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11392.08s)]
*  You look at it, you go, what the fuck is this? [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11397.08s)]
*  This is the old, find some of that shit. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11399.08s)]
*  This is the oldest known human language. [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11402.08s)]
*  That's how they used to write it. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11404.08s)]
*  Right there? [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11405.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11406.08s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck? [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11407.08s)]
*  And I bet you it's a whole story. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11408.08s)]
*  I'm sure it is. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11410.08s)]
*  They've deciphered some of it. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11411.08s)]
*  It's like very controversial, but there's a guy named Zachariah Sitchin. [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11413.08s)]
*  Why is it controversial? [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11416.08s)]
*  Because I'm going to tell you. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11417.08s)]
*  There's a guy named Zachariah Sitchin, and he wrote these books about his translations [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11418.08s)]
*  of the Sumerian text. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11424.08s)]
*  And he said that it's all about the Anunnaki, this species that lives on planet Nibiru [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11426.08s)]
*  that comes into contact with Earth every like 3,600 years. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11432.08s)]
*  And they created us. [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11436.08s)]
*  They use us to mine for gold. [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11437.08s)]
*  And they've merged with us and gave us their DNA into lower primates and created people. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11440.08s)]
*  And this guy was like a legit scholar. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11447.08s)]
*  That's what's nuts about this. [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11450.08s)]
*  This whole fucking, this whole ancient Sumerian period is a wild period in human history. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11451.08s)]
*  So what else? [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11458.08s)]
*  Six thousand years ago. [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11459.08s)]
*  See, that's the part I always have a hard time with. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11460.08s)]
*  Like people say it's 7,000, 10,000. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11463.08s)]
*  How do they figure all that out? [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11466.08s)]
*  Carbon dating. [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11468.08s)]
*  So what they do is you, and it's not exact to like the day in October. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11469.08s)]
*  No, no. [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11474.08s)]
*  But it's in a range of a couple of hundred years, depending upon what kind of carbon [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11475.08s)]
*  date they use. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11480.08s)]
*  So they get organic material. [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11481.08s)]
*  They get organic material that's from that area. [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11482.08s)]
*  So if they dig down, they find a pot, right? [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11485.08s)]
*  And then in that pot, they can take organic material of that pot and then they can carbon [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11488.08s)]
*  date it. [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11492.08s)]
*  If that organic material is 10,000 years old, they can reasonably assume that pot is probably [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11493.08s)]
*  10,000 years old too. [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11497.08s)]
*  All right. [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11498.08s)]
*  That always just bothered my mind. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11499.08s)]
*  That's what they do. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11501.08s)]
*  That's awful to my mind. [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11502.08s)]
*  It's not exact. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11503.08s)]
*  You know, it's really close. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11506.08s)]
*  They're pretty good at it now. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11507.08s)]
*  I think it's radiocarbon data. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11509.08s)]
*  Radiocarbon dating is the most advanced version, but they're constantly making better versions [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11511.08s)]
*  of this too. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11516.08s)]
*  That's how they know. [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11517.08s)]
*  Interesting. [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11518.08s)]
*  So these fucking people lived 6,000 years ago, dude. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11519.08s)]
*  And they talked about these beings that came from another planet. [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11521.08s)]
*  From heaven to earth came. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11527.08s)]
*  That's the Anunnaki. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11529.08s)]
*  I'm at the point where I don't know anything anymore. [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11530.08s)]
*  I really don't. [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11535.08s)]
*  If we want to say 10 years ago, if you brought a flat earth to me, I'd be like, I don't even [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11536.08s)]
*  want you in my house. [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11544.08s)]
*  I don't even want you in my house. [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11545.08s)]
*  And now you're like, let me hear your argument. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11546.08s)]
*  Wow, that's okay. [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11549.08s)]
*  Wow. [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11550.08s)]
*  You know, I never thought of it like that. [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11551.08s)]
*  Or if you bring up almost anything now, I go, oh wow. [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11553.08s)]
*  You know what? [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11556.08s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11557.08s)]
*  You're getting good weed. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11558.08s)]
*  That's what it is. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11559.08s)]
*  Well, that's the scary part is I don't know if that's, if I am, that's the, if I had great [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11560.08s)]
*  weed, I might even be, I might figure it all out. [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11566.44s)]
*  But what I mean is I literally feel we really don't know anything anymore. [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11569.6s)]
*  Well we know something. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11577.24s)]
*  I'm at that point. [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11578.24s)]
*  We certainly know something. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11579.24s)]
*  We know a lot. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11580.24s)]
*  But there's like an old quote that as the, the bonfire, what is it? [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11581.24s)]
*  It's a Dennis McKenna quote. [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11586.039999999999s)]
*  He said something about as the bonfire of enlightenment grows, the surface area of ignorance [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11587.64s)]
*  is exposed. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11593.599999999999s)]
*  So the bigger the fire of knowledge grows, the more areas exposed you realize how much [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11594.599999999999s)]
*  you don't know. [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11601.439999999999s)]
*  So in the beginning, people never thought about subatomic particles. [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11602.76s)]
*  As the bonfire of knowledge grows brighter, the more the darkness is revealed to our startled [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11605.68s)]
*  eyes. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11610.439999999999s)]
*  That's the quote. [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11611.439999999999s)]
*  It's beautiful quote. [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11612.439999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's Terrence McKenna quote that. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11613.439999999999s)]
*  So that quote is like what's going on. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11614.439999999999s)]
*  As much as we think we know, we're still in the, one day people in the future will look [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11616.640000000001s)]
*  back at us like we look back at fucking idiots making arrowheads out of rocks. [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11622.480000000001s)]
*  Right. [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11628.08s)]
*  That's right. [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11629.08s)]
*  At the end of the day. [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11630.08s)]
*  That's what they're going to think about us. [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11631.08s)]
*  And I also think about, I don't want to, Bible, whatever. [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11632.08s)]
*  How do we know when you're in truly a biblical time? [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11637.44s)]
*  We could be in it right now. [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11642.52s)]
*  And how do we know who the prophets are? [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11643.76s)]
*  And how do we know if there's not prophets among us? [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11646.32s)]
*  Well, listen, if the Bible's real, you're always in a biblical time. [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11649.8s)]
*  So if the Bible is a representation of the actual history of the universe, if that's [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11653.76s)]
*  what it really is, it's just told through the telephone game to like a thousand years [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11658.6s)]
*  and then written down. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11663.88s)]
*  But think about in the beginning, there was light. [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11665.439999999999s)]
*  Isn't that the big bang? [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11667.279999999999s)]
*  Dude, I don't, I don't. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11668.68s)]
*  If you think about just parts of the idea of God creating the earth and God creating [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11671.400000000001s)]
*  the universe and doing it quickly, the fucking big bang was pretty goddamn quick. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11674.560000000001s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't six days, but it's pretty fucking crazy that something just existed. [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11678.28s)]
*  Now, if you were a person that had been told that and then you tell other people that for [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11682.720000000001s)]
*  a thousand years and then someone writes it down, maybe that's what you get. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11688.16s)]
*  Maybe you get God created, you know, the heavens and the earth in six days. [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11692.36s)]
*  Maybe that is their version of the origin of the universe as it was told to people that [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11695.560000000001s)]
*  understood it 10,000 years ago, 12,000 years ago, whatever it was. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11701.52s)]
*  And then when we got wiped out and we had to re-figure things out again, you just get [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11705.560000000001s)]
*  these stories, these whispers of the past. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11708.720000000001s)]
*  I feel we should always be writing the new future rather than depending on. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11711.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11717.92s)]
*  Depending on the past. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11718.92s)]
*  Depending on the past, start writing the now for the better and create a new, create [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11719.92s)]
*  the new story. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11728.4s)]
*  I think we are doing that. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11729.4s)]
*  I do too. [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11730.4s)]
*  I just think it's a long, arduous process and it's not linear. [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11731.4s)]
*  It's not like you always win and the bad people always lose. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11734.52s)]
*  We're not going to get it right away. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11736.52s)]
*  Correct. [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11737.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11738.52s)]
*  Right. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11739.52s)]
*  There's a struggle going on right now with human nature and human beings. [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11740.52s)]
*  It's all happening all over the world. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11744.16s)]
*  Someone made a good, I heard the old example, like you're a rat in a cage and all you know [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11746.96s)]
*  is like you drink from that water bottle and you're fed every day at this time. [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11751.8s)]
*  Smash some pumpkins, bro. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11755.439999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11756.919999999998s)]
*  There you go. [[03:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11757.919999999998s)]
*  Despite all my rage. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11758.919999999998s)]
*  Right. [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11759.919999999998s)]
*  I'm still just a rat in a cage. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11760.919999999998s)]
*  Whatever I have conversations, whether it's for my wife or whatever, and we get into this, [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11761.919999999998s)]
*  I always just go, despite all my rage. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11767.199999999999s)]
*  Give me some of that to close this out with. [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11771.039999999999s)]
*  Still just a rat in a cage. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11772.8s)]
*  You figured it all out. [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11776.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11777.48s)]
*  That is the teenage angst song. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11778.48s)]
*  You can talk about everything and anything over and over and over. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11780.24s)]
*  At the end of the day, despite all my rage, still just a rat, the way he says rat, rat [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11783.88s)]
*  in a cage. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11791.64s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i9S9DFpIo&t=11797.24s)]
