# JRE MMA Show #87 with Kamaru Usman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIQTPo262rQ)
*  Three two one champ. What's up? How are you? What's up, Joe?
*  How are you man? I'm good. I'm good. Life is good. Life is good. It's good stressful, but it's good
*  Well, I mean it has to be stressful. You're the king of the hill. Yes. Yes, and it that's a lot of things
*  They don't tell you do remember up there Matt Hughes when he lost a BJ pan. I was interviewing him in the octagon
*  He said something like really honest and very shocking. He said honestly he goes it's a relief
*  He goes like being a champ and the stress of it all he goes
*  I'm I feel relieved to have been lost like first of all to lose. It's very like
*  The fact that he had the balls to say that like just admit it like hey, it's a relief like, you know
*  He just choked me out, but I'm happy. I'm happy
*  It is for guys like that that have reached that status. It is the Anderson Silva. Yeah, the George St. Pierre
*  those guys it is a relief because
*  You know and I'm just I'm starting to see a little bit why
*  because
*  As soon as I walk out of there defending your title as soon as you just beat this kid up
*  Fans can't wait to say oh, no, this is the guy that's gonna beat you. That's the guy that's gonna beat you
*  So there's there's really no come down, you know, let me take a vacation. Let me do this
*  No, because fans are on it
*  They want a guy to step in there with you tomorrow to beat you that's always gonna happen. Yeah, you know
*  Everybody anybody who's a champ? Yeah, but that that's not imagine doing that five six seven times over and over like these guys
*  George St. Pierre decades have done over it just gets overwhelming because it's like nothing's ever good enough for you guys
*  You know, I can't go out there put on a flawless performance win and just have you guys say, you know what?
*  He's the best. No, it's like
*  You were good. But yeah, this guy's gonna beat you this guy this guy's good enough
*  There's always gonna be a certain percentage of people that are not happy with anything
*  I saw a lot of people there tweeting talking shit about Connor after he just won
*  Flawless victory 40 second knockout of Donald Cerrone and they were like that doesn't prove shit
*  You know, he's gonna fall apart if he fights anybody good soon as he gets in there with a wrestler this and that blah blah blah
*  It's like some people are just negative. Absolutely. You can't fix them
*  You just got to accept them the way they are just like I know and it's one of the advice that Rashad gave me early on
*  Is uh make friends with this
*  Make friends with with uh, cuz I you know, you get worked up before a fight, you know
*  You know, he's like no make friends with that feeling because that that's a good feeling, you know
*  Or you backstage before your fight. You're super nervous. You want to take a shit, you know
*  You want to pee you pee like 50 times you barely drinking water, but somehow there's some kind of pee coming out
*  And he's like no make friends with that feeling, you know, the moment you accept that feeling
*  It's not that big of a burden anymore Rashad's a wise man a super wise man. That's a very that's a very wise
*  Piece of advice because you can really change your perception based on how you approach something and just deciding this
*  All right. This is a part of the process. This is what's up
*  Big for me right now. Yeah, very very big for me because I am a creature of a routine. I love having a routine and
*  and it's a fine line between routine and
*  Obsessive compulsive
*  It's a very very fine line
*  Yeah, because and it started on for me early on when I when I started to succeed in wrestling
*  I was I okay. This is my routine. Okay, I'm looking at the okay
*  I'm ten matches out so that means I need to get up and I need to warm up my warm-up was the same
*  Okay, I'm gonna jog back and forth twice before I skip back and forth twice before I do my lunges back and forth twice
*  Before I do my stance emotion back and forth twice
*  Like it was it was that routine I had to do it at that time and I'm going to the restroom
*  I need to pee before I go for this match, but I'm gonna go into the same bathroom
*  I'm going to the same stall. Mmm, you know, I'm gonna pee and I'm gonna come out and use the same sink to wash my hand
*  Get one or two paper towels throw it away go back out
*  like it got to a point where it's like that's my routine and then I
*  Go out there and I perform and I win him. I get that. That's why that's why I'm performing
*  so it's like OCD it because there's a fine line so I had to realize that that's a fine line because
*  It's not necessarily OCD because when you when it becomes obsessive compulsive is when for me
*  What is when you feel like you can't succeed unless you do those things, right? So it's like dang. I forgot to do that
*  Whoa, I'm gonna lose I'm gonna lose
*  No, it's I had to learn how to control it early because it's like my that's my routine
*  But even if I didn't do that
*  I didn't have enough time to do that because sometimes you don't have enough time to do it, right?
*  You know something goes out of whack matches and early but you don't have enough time to to get your routine in so it's like
*  Had to be able to adjust my mind. Okay, we still go out there and perform
*  We still got especially in the fight game
*  You know you go out there's quick two quick knockouts boom boom boom you thinking you've got 30 minutes to warm up and stuff
*  Like no, you got to coming back. You got ten minutes. It's like oh, I got ten minutes
*  I can't get my whole routine in how much time do you need like say if you're in the locker room and
*  Like before you walk out for the fight, how much time do you need to get everything loosened up? What do you like?
*  I mean, I'm older now
*  My joints make noises now, so
*  Not too crazy because I work out that morning before the fight
*  I work that's when I really get the hard work out in you have a hard workout the day of the fight
*  They have the day of the fight. I work out shit
*  All my coaches, you know my training partners everybody we go in and we get a good a good sweat
*  I like to blow it all out because the night before I don't because that's that's the day of weigh-ins
*  So you just cut that Thursday night you cut a lot of you cut the weight
*  Dehydrated you weigh in that morning of that Friday morning. So that Friday is dedicated to just
*  Rehydrating and eating how much do you cut? I?
*  Don't get that that that last fight was
*  Probably one of the biggest I stayed throughout and I think I was up to about maybe 197
*  And but when I start really full-fledged going two days in camp
*  I try to keep my weight around 192 191 because that's why I feel strong
*  You know, but not my fastest cuz I've seen you walk around in between fights. I'm like how the fuck
*  It's it's it's fake. It's just you know
*  I do a couple of
*  Hug you there's no air and those muscles I've got a back and I you know, I am I do a couple of you know
*  Freaking curls and my arms just swell up just you swell up
*  But but 197 if you're getting up to 197 you're cutting 27 pounds. Yeah, how much does that take out of you?
*  Well, like I said, I'm a creature of a routine and and I like to get into that routine
*  So I'm dieting well eating well
*  so
*  by when I'm down to about
*  3% I think it's probably some of the leanest I've been
*  Yeah, when I'm down to this from calipers or from a dog from from calipers and say that caliber things not totally
*  I mean, yeah, of course is not gonna be completely accurate, right?
*  You know but around that area because I just have nothing. I'm just extremely lean and at that point I'm
*  A hundred and eighty I want to say eighty four eighty five pounds. So you're just cutting that's 15 pounds of water
*  Yeah, but about I would say 12 anywhere from 12 to is as water
*  But you know, I have an amazing team behind me, you know amazing strength and conditioning coach amazing
*  You know nutritionists I work with Clint up at the PI
*  No, and is he the one who hooks hooks up the weight cutting and all that?
*  Yeah, they help with it, you know because he lives in Vegas and I'm in South Florida so me me and Clint we stay in
*  contact, you know and
*  And one thing that I liked about Clint is the fact that he gave me the time to say hey
*  You know, let's let's really test your body look at all this and that, you know
*  You're the kind of athlete you carry a lot of muscle and and you know
*  There's that stigma that if you have a lot of muscle you run out of gas really really fast
*  But the way you work we got to make sure that you're eating the right way to make sure you sustain that
*  And of course my strength and conditioning coach dr. Corey Peacock. I mean PhD and you know, the
*  Associate professor over at Nova University, you know in exercise physiology. I mean smart brilliant guy
*  You know, I've been working with him since my first fight in the UFC and you have
*  Particular needs because you've got problems with your knees. So you can't run exactly like like that's why I started working with him
*  is is before that I was working with Jake Benachi and Jake is
*  Amazing, you know Jake was like extreme couture for a long long time and Jake knew what he was doing
*  But Jake, you know the thing with Jacob's Jake was a mastermind with a you know
*  If you're an athlete you got all your body parts work
*  So well, this is what we need to do to get you tip-top state shape
*  and then when Corey came in was after I had that injury because I had a micro fracture surgery and
*  Then I had to fight the finale like three and a half months after that
*  So micro fracture surgery is that shit they do to try to rebuild cartilage in your knees
*  Oh, it is which was yeah that now some doctors like oh, yeah, that's from the stone age
*  You don't do that anymore. Really but it's they go it's when they go and I guess they create
*  Tiny little fracture right and whether it's the you know for mine was a knee. So it's the femoral conda or the
*  Forget what the bones call but they tried to tibia, you know, they try to I guess let it bleed in and
*  Create, you know the cartilage, you know, and does it work at all? No, I didn't I think it actually set me back a big
*  Yeah, but you know ever done stem cells, yeah, I took care of ice I went and did stem cells and you do it in Panama
*  No, I didn't go to Panama, but that doctor did it for me in Dallas. Dr. Neil Reardon. Yeah. Yeah, they can do some crazy shit in Panama
*  Yeah, a lot of guys my sent my mom down there twice. Yeah, they told my mom she needed knee replacement and
*  I was like before we do this. Let's let's just see what happens and it took you know, my mom's in her 70s
*  So it took a while but about eight months in the pain went away
*  And then I sent her down for a second time and looks even more improved
*  What's really crazy is I saw her over Christmas and she looked younger
*  Well, yeah, so I mean I'm sure it has a lot of different effects a lot of different ways that that I think it help out
*  But in my case the the thing about it is I'm so active
*  That is very very hard to sit back and say oh man that worked because I'm still kicking every day
*  I still feel that pain kicking every day. I still feel that pain of bouncing on my knees taking shots
*  I really wanted to heal up you got to take time off, but that's not I could afford
*  What about just swimming like could you do that for a couple months just swim only for strength and conditioning and just do that
*  I do swim, you know, I don't I don't really run a lot, you know
*  that's the thing with Cory Peacock is when he came in was
*  adjusting me to
*  Not being so hard on my knees, you know working away from that because I haven't really done a back squat since
*  Maybe 2014 is that something that's particularly rough on your knees? Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, imagine carrying all that load and square
*  That was bad and then you know the Russian split squats and all that all those were
*  Were killing my knees and those are the things that you know, we're taught to do
*  For strength right? Yeah, I need to be strong and explosive. So I need to squat
*  I need to do all these things
*  But you know Cory came in and really kind of help, you know mold the way that I work
*  And not necessarily killing all those we still squat. Well, you know, we'll switch it up
*  We'll do that, you know the kettlebell front squat
*  so we'll you know, we'll do a bunch of different squats, but he
*  He really came in and helped kind of shape the way that I I went about it
*  so, you know my strength and that's the thing that I always do year-round is I try not to slip on my strength and
*  Conditioning because I know I have a lot of muscles and the same time I got to keep keep that's also part of your style
*  Right. You're so you push a pace. Yeah, I got to push that pace and and a lot of guys are strong right away
*  Like the one that hit you and it's like oh man that guy's strong
*  But what about the guy that hits you and then keeps going because guys can't a lot of guys can't maintain that and sustain
*  And that's where I like to think I have an edge over everybody
*  And so this strength and conditioning coach that you've been working with from the beginning
*  What give us like a what what's a regular routine for you? Like what kind of shit does he have you do? Dr.
*  Peek, okay. So we just um, we started getting back in there
*  Literally last week so he took a little time off. How's your hand?
*  That's the thing I free I went and know the doctors gonna hate me for this I
*  Had a cast on so then I go to Vegas and um, and I talked to the doctors
*  you know the UFC doc and those guys in Vegas and
*  You know, it's not broken
*  You know, it's just an issue with the ligament as you can see seeing this right hand right here at the bottom of the thumb
*  You could clearly see the ligaments. You know all working there, but then here there's that bump in between
*  So they don't come out as much and that's causing me I don't have I didn't have I don't have the strength like
*  You know being able to pull and this is a big part of my game is if I get around you
*  I get a body lock. I don't care what you're doing. You just not getting me off
*  I just I've spent years just working on that grip to where you just not
*  You know, I let me off until I let off right and so now not being able to do that
*  but it's it's healing fast and I was in Vegas and the doctors like
*  We can just cut the cast off and make you a hard
*  Removable one that I can take off on and off so I can shower because I was a thing you stuck in this cast for
*  Four weeks you can't really shower with it
*  You got to shower with your arm up in the air on your hands
*  They're so bad when it's out and then when it itches and you I got to stick stuff in there
*  Yeah, and and psychological I started getting a little anxiety with it too because it's like can't get this thing off my hand
*  I
*  Said sometimes I was laying there. I'm just like I want it off my hand and I can't get it off
*  So is it a ligament tear? Is that what it's not a tear?
*  They they they thought it was a tear at the bottom, but you know strength is coming back slowly
*  So yeah, it was like a really bad strain and that that bump is still there for some reason
*  So we're working on it. I'm doing everything all just no fright and no fracture, which is good news
*  So I don't have to be out for too long
*  Yeah, cuz you sent me the tape of like when you hurt in training
*  Yeah, see it like so it was one of those things where you you hit with the thumb
*  I hit it with knuckle because you know when you got those big gloves on, you know, you can't really make a full fist
*  Right, you know, especially when you have wraps so your hands kind of in there like this
*  So you throw a punch the wrong way or somebody comes into you the wrong way. It's like boom you heard
*  You know, so I heard it at one. I'm like, oh what am I gonna do now, you know?
*  So now everything's going through my head. I got this guy has been talking shit
*  For years and and everybody in the world is telling me you have to kill this guy
*  You can't be that you can't lose to him. So now I'm going through all this in my mind though
*  I can't be that guy. I can't lose to that guy. I can't lose to that guy and then it's like
*  Then I'm like, okay. No, it feels a little better. I'm going I'm gonna spar hard
*  So I start sparring boom right away hurt it again
*  And I a couple of times I almost cry and you're getting it taped up hard to some getting it taped up
*  So it's still hurting but then he gets to a point where I'm just like shit got to block it out
*  You know fights a fire got to block it out. So I'm gonna dress the room a train. Everything's okay
*  I block it out. I'm not even thinking about it. I'm thinking about going to work and then I get in there first round
*  I don't even remember. I just remember throwing it boom. Something's wrong. Oh
*  And I'm just like, okay play it off play it off and then props to Kobe like, you know, he comes on and he's
*  You know, he's doing his job he's fighting me he's in there landing strikes and I'm like
*  Okay, you know, but
*  At that some point I never thought I'm gonna lose this fight because I never think like that
*  It's like oh, I'm not gonna lose this fight. Even if something's not going my way
*  I just I'm gonna adapt if I wasn't it but like on the work the scorecards
*  At the end of the fight were very close. Yeah, I I knew it was close
*  I would because it for the first time ever I asked my coaches
*  Did I win that round? Hmm. I've never in my career done that
*  I'm the type of guy even when I was wrestling I'm the red type of wrestler who I like to run up the scoreboard
*  I don't like to live and leave any doubt that I won that round. I'm gonna dominate that round
*  I'm gonna make sure I won. So in my head, I know I want I don't need to ask
*  For the first time in my career. I went back my
*  Did I win that round that win that round?
*  But I even by me asking that I never thought oh, I'm not gonna finish this fight I
*  Always knew I was gonna finish the fight, but I just was like I was did I win that did I win that?
*  You know, I don't know why I don't know how or what what was going on in my head
*  But for some reason I asked I was asking so I knew the fight was close. It was a good fucking fight, man
*  It was a good fight
*  The thing about Colby is he tricks you into thinking he sucks because he's got a goofy suit on and he talks crazy
*  And you know, he wears the MAGA hat and all that stuff
*  But but then if you didn't see any of that if you just watched him fight you like that motherfucker puts a pace on people
*  Yeah, a lot he did a Robbie Lawler
*  I was like good lord like nobody does that to Robbie Lawler like he put a fucking pace on him
*  He just stayed on him like guys have wrestled him before Robbie, you know
*  Like got a hold of him dragged him down tried to make it a you know, a stick, you know, try to stall him out
*  That's not what Colby did Colby just stuck on him like glue and just put that pace on him
*  Yeah, I mean he really he really that he really showed, you know, like how good he is
*  And I mean, I I give respect the respect to do I'm not no hater, you know, I know this kid fight
*  I know he was good. I know he was tough and I knew he was a competitor as well
*  He's always been a competitor. I knew guys that weren't wrestling teams with this guy, you know, besides John Jones
*  I knew other guys, you know that I'm good friends with that wrestled with him
*  So I've always known that he was a competitor that he was gonna come out and try to compete, you know
*  but like I said, I just mentally I think I'm just on a different level than these guys just because
*  Everything that I've been through that I've done in my life has shaped me into the man that I am
*  So mentally I'm just on a different level than him. Well, you have to have that attitude, right? Yeah, and I just I just I felt it
*  I knew it and I felt it
*  Even and now so more so than ever because now you've got all the fans but you know on
*  What he's got his fans you've got everyone has fans that are gonna talk shit
*  Well, there was the first time that you had a close fight. Yeah, you have seen yeah, which is kind of crazy
*  I mean think about your career is pretty fucking nuts
*  I mean you win the title over one of the best welterweights of all time and Tyron Woodley and you just dominate him
*  Right you think about all the other guys dos angios all those guys you smashed and what I mean
*  That's you had a crazy run up to the title and then a crazy title winning effort
*  And then this was the first time we saw you in like a very close fight. Yeah, I mean
*  Attest to him too. Like he's a tough guy at the end of the day, you know to make fantastic fights
*  You got to have the right dance partner. Yes
*  Frazier needed Ali they need each other and he was the right dance partner and to be honest with you
*  You know if I didn't take too much out of him because each fight takes something from you, you know internally
*  so if I didn't take too much from him, I
*  Think I might see him again to be honest because like it's clear that we are the two best guys in the division
*  And so yeah, I mean I look forward to seeing him again. I think you guys will see each other again
*  I do I'm really interested to see what happens with Tyron and Leon Edwards, you know, they're fighting next
*  That's a big fight a very hard fight. It is guys. It is it's a
*  It's a hard fight for both guys, but it's stylistically matches up well for both guys because
*  Tyron has a lot of successes with which Southpaw guys. Mm-hmm that right? Yeah, he's got that that cannon is right hand and and
*  Tyron is
*  Very very good when guys don't completely dominate and control what's going on and
*  Leon Edwards has done better at that with guys that he feels like he can keep up with but with the guy like Tyron
*  Woodley that I can wrestle like Tyron Woodley that's got power like him
*  I wonder how he's going to do well
*  I feel like Leon gets the least amount of attention when it comes to like top flight world-class fighters
*  He's a top flight world-class fighter, but he gets the least amount of attention out of those guys for whatever weird reason
*  I mean, it's the era that we live in. I mean this this is the first fight
*  Like if you really think about it, this is the first fight you're actually starting to hear his voice
*  I right it's like yeah, who is Leon?
*  Scott or Edward whatever. Well, the biggest thing with him was when he had a fist fight with Maz Vidal like when they when they
*  Had it wasn't a fist fight like like Maz would all just whatever that guy whatever his name is, you know, I mean
*  You know, he openly said it you have one of the best sucker punches in the game
*  And the best 40-yard dash so you go in there you sucker punch somebody backstage and you run out of there and they rush
*  You out of London before it. Yeah, Brits can get a hold of you before the London boys came back, you know, so I mean, yeah
*  That that's kind of unfortunately for Leon
*  That's kind of crazy too because when you're in a foreign country and you commit assault
*  Usually they lock you the fuck up. They got him out of there. Let's just they got him out of there
*  But it's weird like no charges no nothing they got him out of there but isn't that kind of cuz there's video
*  It's not like we don't know what happened. Yeah, and the crazy thing is that he gets praised for that. Yes
*  Famous he gets for that now imagine I do that over there
*  Or imagine anybody else to anybody else doing that in London, it's how do you do it?
*  It's weird. Like how did Mazda get away with it? It's it is weird
*  With the forces that be UFC is very they're very good what they do and let's just say they got him out of there quick
*  Let's just say let's just say yeah. Yeah, he's been talking crazy shit
*  Yeah, that might be your next fight
*  What do you think that's gonna be your next fight? I hope so because of
*  Because of the way that think I'm the type of guy to where anything you say can and will be used against you inside
*  That octagon. Oh your a court of law
*  Exactly. I'm the judge the juror and executioner
*  and
*  And that that's how I approach it
*  You know cuz some guys you just signed the contract to go fight the guys, right?
*  But I get obsessed with the fact that I'm want them to say something
*  I'm waiting for them to say something
*  It's a little tougher that the guys that don't really have to say anything else have anything negative to say
*  It's a little tougher to go in there and you know and get angry get angry to fight them and I'm I
*  Look at I want them to say something. They do an interview that pops up with my Google Earth song
*  You know my someone from my team would tell me boom someone did this interview about this check it out if I have time
*  I'll watch it. Oh, he said that
*  Okay, you know and this guy
*  It's you know what it's it's funny to see the way it's shifted like the career his career is shifted
*  This is God's been known for a long long time a long time
*  Yeah, and he was a run-of-the-mill guy would win some lose some win some lose some I mean
*  You know not that long ago he was losing
*  You know, but and the credit to his team as well, you know, they've done a good job at
*  Picking the right fights to really get him to where he is now, but you know what actually happened
*  You know his story he went he went on a South American game show
*  Well, yeah, he was 300 pounds before he went and did that was he like he he was really fat
*  Bra look at pictures look at pictures really but this is like post wonder boy, wasn't it?
*  Yeah, is it somewhere around there? I guess somewhere around there. I think it's post wonder boy right after but
*  Really bad fat night when I fought was it I fought wonder boy
*  No when I fought Damien Maia, I think that was like the tail end of the of the
*  the huskiness on
*  his part, but it was
*  At some point like listen like everyone's buying into the hype
*  This is what I'm saying that they've done a good job at creating this hype by picking the fights to where
*  One fight was a gamble the Ben Askren fight was a gamble
*  You know you win that fight you take all that hype that this guy has which this guy didn't belong in there in the first place
*  but
*  Previously in his career early on his career. You could make the argument that yes, but at that point in his career
*  He didn't belong in there, but he goes out there
*  Let's say Ben Askren does take him down and does what Ben Askren does you we wouldn't be having this conversation right now
*  Hmm, so he goes that's a gamble on their part and the gamble paid off
*  He went in they took all that hype from Ben
*  Then who's the next guy the guy that you know another guy that wins some lose some but has a ton of hype because he just
*  Fought Connor goes in there and fights Nate
*  Now that fight turns out the way did you get all this hype now you got all these people thinking
*  Oh my god, this guy's a killer. Where has he been this and that it's the same guy
*  That was 300 pounds not too long ago
*  Above north of 200. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm talking ever saw him fat
*  Yeah, you should look at pictures. Oh, yeah, but you know hats off to him
*  He got the weight off and you know, he went over and did his thing and I'm no hater
*  I give credit what credit is do yeah, but but don't he was always that guy that said, you know what?
*  I'm not I'm not this cliche. I'm not playing this character. I'm not doing this, you know, I'm just a real fighter in this
*  But then you're showing up at fucking press conferences is looking like the knockoff of Scarface
*  Yeah, but don't you think that that's wise like no it is why it is what it is. Yeah, but say it like it is
*  Don't sit here and say oh these guys are being gimmick. These guys are doing this. This guy's are doing that
*  You're doing the same damn thing and then look at what he did that last fight
*  Oh my god, he took the biggest L of that night. Like that was corny. You want to wear the robe?
*  You want to stand there? You say he was holding that silver belt like he they actually think this is a real belt the BMF
*  They didn't need a BMF belt for this last fight with Connor and cowboy they just needed a good matchup
*  Yeah, right. So why what is why does the BMF belt like is that a one time?
*  Yeah, it was it was something they created to kind of hide that fight they they needed they I mean
*  They really need a belt though. Did they need no they didn't but you know
*  If they they get loud enough and Dana hears them and Dana sees that Dana is a very smart man
*  greatest promoter ever seen you know and
*  To jump on that like you know what shit like let's make a nice little
*  Motherfucker make a nice little silver belt, you know, this little
*  It's like a gold yeah, it's like a silver color purplish color pull a picture of it
*  I want to see that thing again. It's a beautiful belt
*  What the beautiful belt is beautiful. That's more beautiful. That's more
*  It's like saying like, you know, I mean you look at a new Corvette you go
*  That's a beautiful car. Yeah, then you look at a Ferrari. Oh, that's a better looking car. Oh, yeah
*  That's better looking. Oh or the Bentley's. Oh
*  Yes, I want that it's another level but it's yeah
*  This one's like the Bentley and then the Honda Civic
*  It is silver
*  Silver was that copper? No, that's not copper. It's like a
*  Sterling so it seems kind of goldish in some it means seems like the lighting. No, it's sterling silver
*  It's like that. I kind of think it's gold. No, it's not gold. No, no
*  It's not bronze. Yeah, it's like bronze. Is it bronze? Is it? It's not even silver. It's not even second place
*  I
*  Mean this is like honestly, this is like a participation medal
*  You know how when you do the field day and they give you the participation medals
*  They're like here you go kid. You did a great job and that's what this is
*  Well, if you beat him, do you get that belt too? I want that shit
*  I want it because you do with it if you had it would you wear both of them? No, what'd you do with it?
*  Just put aside put it in my closet
*  I
*  Would put it in my closet, but it's like there's not there's no I'm what that means nothing
*  It was just something to hypify but they've ran that his team has ran with it. Like yeah
*  When they called it when they showed the video of him when they went to the camera turned to him during the last
*  Pay-per-view the fucking pop was gigantic everybody went crazy when they saw him. Yeah, I mean the hype is real
*  Yeah, you the hype is real. It's alive, you know
*  Big people. I love him
*  You know, but that's the thing is people love you until they really see what you are
*  You know Darren till had a lot of hype and shout out to their too
*  I mean, you know, he's still you know growing in this in the sport
*  But he had a lot of hype to where people were saw me this guy's gonna beat Woodley
*  Right like even at some point I was like yo, he might get Woodley really I was like he might get willy
*  And you can see in a spy really disrespectful if they were that they were making him the favorite in that fight
*  I'm like you guys are crazy. You're crazy
*  I mean this guy's already fought one of the best strikers twice in in wonder boy and beat him both times
*  Not just that he was the only one that hurt him
*  Yeah
*  Like he hurt wonder boy bad in both of those fights wonder boy never heard him
*  So you got the guy who's arguably one of the best strikers to ever do it in the welterweight division
*  I mean wonder boys a fantastic kickbox. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah Tywin. See mashed him. You saw what wonder boy did
*  To mouse with all yeah. Yeah pointed him. Yeah. Yeah good fight
*  I mean he dropped him like several times. Did he drop him? Yeah a couple times
*  Well, Darren dropped him to yeah until dropped Moss Vidal too. But yeah, Moss Vidal starched him
*  Yeah, and you know, I give credit what credit is do you know?
*  But like like I'm saying back to that like yeah, I was almost like you saw what like that's I'm sure
*  We'll leave is a little afraid in that fight because it's like do you think so? Yeah. Yeah, you have to be I think
*  All the hype they were putting behind them you have to be because at some point as a champ and that's what makes you
*  Saying as a champion is that little fears like wow, they're really saying is this kid really good enough? He's the favorite
*  Is he good enough? I thought that was so crazy
*  Yeah, sometimes there's odds and I'm like this is just this doesn't make any sense at all to me I agree
*  You know, there's certain odds where I'm like you guys who's making these odds
*  Yeah
*  Beat me especially these rankings too. I'm like they've got this kid at number three
*  He hasn't fought him for he hasn't fought number one number two hasn't fought number five hasn't fought number six
*  I'm like how in the hell is he number three?
*  Masvidal's number three that's a little bit. Well who it makes the rankings
*  Rankings are okay. I don't yeah, we're who makes rankings
*  Sometimes a guy will beat a guy and then he'll be below that guy in the rankings like what?
*  Wonderboy wonderboy put on a clinic versus wonderboy. I think is even top ten
*  I don't think wonder boys it I think he might be like nine or something like that, which I think is insane
*  Well the Vicente Luque fight, which was his last fight. Yeah, that was
*  I think I think he was like ranked up. I want to say 11 or something. Yeah, that's that's the center. That's crazy
*  Yeah, Vicente is tough tough guy. Maybe to tough fighter. Yeah
*  Like a lot of people gonna have their hands full of Vicente. Oh, he's an animal, you know
*  Yeah, animal there's a couple guys in division right now and I see these guys
*  You know, Jeff Neal is another guy
*  Oh
*  The dark horse and I'm not taking my eyes off none of these guys I see all these guys
*  Which is why I can't afford to take five months off
*  Yeah, let my knee feel this some type of way like I just neil's the most promising to me
*  I watch that guy move and I'm like Jesus Christ. He's talented. Yeah, he was waiting tables just like a year ago
*  Man, that's that's a struggle. Yeah his last fight against Mike Perry
*  I believe that was his first camp where he didn't have a job. I'm pretty sure I'm sorry if I'm incorrect and big
*  That's what John annexes big respect to that
*  He's fucking telling respect to that because you know a lot of guys are afraid to even do that
*  Mm-hmm, you know and then you got you get some of the guys that they get into UFC like oh my problems to solve
*  I'm good. I'm good now, but they're still struggling
*  Even when you first get in you're still making less than minimum wage when you when you boil it down you
*  You're making less than minimum wage. That's crazy. Yeah, that's so great
*  But it's also like you got to have good food, right?
*  You got to have you got to be able to afford massage
*  You got to be able to afford some things that you're in. Yeah, you're in a hardcore training camp
*  And maybe it is better to have like a little bit of a job, but I think Jeff was waiting tables
*  Yeah, it's it to me. It's crazy like it just seems like
*  Where's the money going like how much money is a cage fight worth? It should be worth a lot
*  He fighting on TV
*  The whole that that should be all you need to do
*  Yeah, now, let me see my first fight in the UFC. Let's say I made 10 and 10
*  Jesus Christ crazy to me. So boom I go in the fight
*  $20,000 boom. I'm like, oh, I got 20 grand
*  All right now first and foremost 20% comes up manager and Jim boom off the top then taxes gone
*  Taxes, you know boom off the top. Yeah, and then it's like, oh, yeah, my daughter just turned one
*  I burnt the party is gonna totally cost $2,500. Oh
*  Because it's one you got to do big. Yeah boom off the top gone my car, you know, they've been letting me
*  You know kind of pile up that car payment for a while now
*  So I need to pay that and the insurance everything that's backed up. So that's like 3200 boom off money's all gone
*  Everything's gone within two weeks. I sat at home still living with Rashad like I got
*  $3,200 left I fought
*  like two and a half weeks ago
*  What?
*  That's crazy. What just happened? It's gonna last you and it's cuz that's your source of income. That's it
*  Yeah, you know, thank God I got that the the performance bonus in that fight
*  How much performance bonus that was 50 they used to give locker room bonuses, right? Is that a thing in the past?
*  It's
*  But I think um, you know, it depends on who the if you're the right guy and you go out there and do something special
*  So tonight, I mean I think Dana is still generous enough
*  Depending on his mood how he's feeling. He's still generous enough to maybe say you know what?
*  Take care of you cuz I'm you see now. He'll just send a couple guys extra
*  He's like man, these these guys did great. I'm gonna send them bonuses too. So he'll just bonus these guys. That's very cool
*  Yeah, yeah, it's not enough money. It's not enough money for fighting
*  You know, I mean it's interesting cuz a boxing match some of people would say well, that's what boxers get
*  I don't think boxing is as rough on you
*  If you're doing a six round boxing match and you're only making a couple thousand dollars
*  Like I kind of get you're moving up the ladder and that's just how it goes
*  But the camps that you guys go through when it comes to wrestling when it comes to submissions when it comes to kickboxing
*  There's so much more potential for damage on your body. It's just so much harder
*  Just getting your legs kicked and just takedowns just those two factors
*  Like there's so much more beating on your back boxers are obviously tough as shit and they obviously have a very difficult job
*  It's not no stone saying boxing is easy
*  But no comparatively physically on your body like a six round, you know pro boxing match when you're in the the preliminaries
*  Yeah, as opposed to a UFC fight or UFC a three round UFC fight can be fucking cake
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, you're only making ten grand
*  It's uh, imagine losing the fight then you only get ten. You only get ten
*  Yeah, then you go home now take all this stuff that I just uh
*  Mentioned you're in the hole. Yeah. Well now imagine you're fighting not even for the UFC. You're fighting for Bellator, right?
*  Yeah, I get even less than that less than that
*  It's and I have friends that that fight for Bellator have friends that fight for you know other promotions and my little brother's fighting too
*  And so he's making his way up to and you know
*  the one thing about him is I have to keep him somewhat grounded because you know, he came he was a big foot big-time football player and
*  And you know potential should be you know still feels like he should be in the NFL, you know
*  But that the thing about that is keeping his mind in
*  Where it should be that hey, this is why it's gonna feel good when you start making million-dollar paychecks
*  It's okay to make one and one now. It's okay to make two thousand and two thousand now
*  How long has he been fighting?
*  How long has he been training
*  Oh shit, yeah, so he's just getting into it. Yeah, just get that's gotta be crazy
*  Your brother has fucking champion of the world and you're just kind of getting your wheels greased up and see
*  and I tried to
*  honestly, I tried to make it not not weird for him because it's uh
*  You know, we're a family to where we like we're very very close family
*  But imagine boys that we're all competitive
*  Boys, like if your brother's doing this good and like you want to do it better
*  Yeah, you know and I'm imagining how it is for him, you know to have a brother
*  That's the champion to where now you're in the sport that your brother was a champion in
*  Yeah, like how is that and and I don't ever want to make it weird for him
*  I want to make it as easy as possible for him because I want him to be I want him to be bigger than because he's a
*  Heavyweight now once he gets yes. Yeah, once he gets how big is he? I think he's like 6'2 to
*  55 to 60. I mean he's a freak
*  My brother's diesel big big dude and if it's um
*  When he gets that striking down and really starts sitting on punches because he wrestled in high school, too
*  He was a high school state runner-up when he starts sitting on punches and really putting this
*  He just got his first standing knockout his last fight. So when he starts putting these guys to sleep
*  I think he's gonna be a humongous star in the sport and how old is he? He is 30
*  That's a weird time to start though, isn't it? Yes, but he's so freakin athletic. It's it's oh my god
*  Yeah, look if you guys go online go to his Instagram at you Muhammad 97
*  like look at some of him and his strength coach are
*  the most outrageous
*  Funniest like guys that you will see online
*  I mean if you it's the fact that he's still a little under the radar now
*  Let him be getting the UFC and get to where I'm at
*  Well, you just put him on right now every video would be over millions of views because they do the most outrageous things
*  But it works right there. That's him right there
*  But it works Jack. It works for him. Oh my god, you watch him training. Let me see some of this
*  This is this is him learn counter seat
*  He's a big fella huge
*  It's crazy that he's only been doing it a year and a half
*  Only been doing a year and a half. So what made him decide to put football aside and start fighting?
*  It was just he was caught in that transition of trying to get get into the NFL trying to get back in and
*  As a free agent and because the NFL man, you got thousands of guys that come out for the same position
*  every year and
*  There of course NFL wants a newer fresher younger guy that they can get for cheaper
*  And so the longer you're out it makes it so much harder to get back in I can also imagine when you're getting close to 30
*  Yeah, these kids are 22 21
*  Full of piss and vinegar. He still thinks he's 20
*  He's still my brother still acts like he's still got the energy of a 21 year old. I mean he is
*  He's the whole definition in my mind of what it is to be have a
*  Lituation, you know, he's always lit always
*  Did he come to you and say hey come on I'm thinking about fighting did he did you guys have a conversation?
*  No, that's that's the weird. That's the weirdest thing about it is uh, see I know my brother so well to where
*  At some point he's and he's very prideful too, you know at some point he didn't want to
*  He's not gonna say I've kind of like round about I can tell when he's getting there
*  He's not gonna say I've kind of like round about I I can tell when he's getting into it cuz I brought him he
*  Went my first ever fight, you know, I brought him to Nebraska with me
*  And so he goes to all my fights and I could tell that he was flirting with it
*  Really? Because he you know, he kind of started, you know training a little bit and and I heard him tell a coach like yeah
*  Yeah, I think I'm just start fighting, you know, but and I tried to have that conversation
*  But it's kind of weird with him. It's kind of a weird dynamic, you know, but I love him to death
*  and
*  But then when I found out that he was kind of really serious about it
*  I'm like, okay
*  This is let's let's lay the plan out for you because I want you to get there faster than I did
*  I want you to get there have an easier time than I did to get to the top
*  You know, so he's working his way. I just got great coaches that he's working with right now
*  Where's he training out of he's training out of Dallas
*  He goes on trains with that safe where you know, Jeff Neil and those guys trains as well
*  He's got striking coaches, you know, Stephen Stephen right down there who worked with Johnny Hendrix
*  So yeah, he's learning he's learning fast and of course his strength coach out there and you train with him at all
*  Not I'm not real not a lot. We haven't really trained a lot together because I'm in Florida and I'm traveling so much
*  To where but I'm in the process to where I'm gonna start getting them to Florida more and more now because now he's
*  You know, he's learning more now. He knows the ground a little bit, you know now he's striking
*  Starting to pick up because the worst thing I want to do is bring him into a camp full of
*  killers like in our gym and have them discourage him, right?
*  You know and you I would hate to do that. Yeah, because he's so talented. He's so athletic
*  I don't want to stun that so early
*  But now it's getting to the point where now it's I can bring him in for test months at a time
*  To where you know the see how where he's at because I mean he's ready. Well, he thinks he can fly tomorrow
*  You know, but you know, I want him to walk that's such an important factor of not discouraging a guy
*  But also testing him like this. It's a fine fine line, right?
*  Yes
*  very very fine line because you you have to be tested because if you've never really tested the worst place that you want to
*  Get tested inside right that cage
*  I'm a firm believer that there's nothing worse than being locked in the cage getting the shit bit out of it beat out of you
*  And there's nothing you can do about it. Yeah, you know, so I would hate for that to happen to him
*  Yeah, and like it happened to me in practice
*  Before I got there I
*  Don't forget the moment at all. And so I don't want that to happen to him inside that cage. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, it's gotta be strange seeing your brother just getting the ball rolling and just getting into it
*  It's a good feeling though. It's a really good feeling seeing him kind of pick it up
*  I think he's six and one. Oh, yeah five and one or six and one now and
*  So it's so he's got off to a quick start. Yeah, I'm quite a few fights. Yeah. Yeah, but that's the thing is, you know, you don't want to
*  You know raking all this fight and be ten and oh you really haven't fought in the way
*  You really haven't been tested and then then you get there and then you get beat up
*  You're like, oh man, you know your second guess in yourself
*  Yeah
*  that's the
*  the
*  difference and we were talking about this the other day the difference between the boxing way of raising a fighter versus
*  The UFC really you don't get a chance to pick your fights and the UFC like in a boxer's career
*  The manager would say okay, let's try you with a guy who's longer who's got a good jab. Okay, we did that
*  Let's try you with a guy who likes to stay glued to your chest. Let's test him with this
*  Let's get him in there with a journeyman. There's a little slippery
*  He's got some good experience and let's let's give you some seasoning the UFC is like do you want this fight? Yeah
*  Hey, you want by John Jones on 18 days notice like what?
*  Yeah, and that's a see boxing has been around so long
*  There's so many boxers that you can pick from because that's everyone does it does that?
*  Yeah, you know, there's these long guys that are journeymen's that have a lot of losses some guys that are kind of 500
*  You can kind of just pick the guys and then you have the promising guy that you're trying to build and you can just kind
*  Of pick guys around him. But you MMA is not really like that yet because it's still so new
*  Everybody is trying to be a champion. Yeah
*  So it makes it difficult to be able to pick guys and on top of it
*  Then you get to the UFC where it's like this is a fight. Yes or no, which I have gotten the call
*  Hey, you're gonna go to Brazil and you're gonna fight this guy
*  If you say no, alright, we're gonna extend your contract. You say yes. Alright, see you there
*  Yeah, it's weird right? You can't you can't negotiate like you can with a normal promoter. No, it's very
*  No, so we were talking about your strength and conditioning because of your knees
*  We kind of got sidetracked like what kind of stuff does he have you doing to replace running and like like off to replace run
*  Like I work in the pool a lot. Hmm myself. I run a lot in the pool and
*  You know, I swim too. I'm not the best swimmer in the world
*  But you know I get in there and I get after and I get tired
*  You know those things that GSP uses where he has like these? Yeah
*  Hands and feet. No, you like I play with those. Yeah, what are those things?
*  Um, they're kind of they create the resistance in the water, you know
*  So it's kind of gives you the resistance pulling pushing and you know throwing punches with them
*  It just gives you that extra work that you need George loves that shit. He loves it. It's like his main
*  training
*  If I can give you a
*  If I can give you a magic wand to come all you can pick ping who you point that magic one
*  GSP all day GSP all day just for the legend status. Yeah, because um
*  George did he went out the way you're supposed to go out and he can still do it
*  Like he proved it to prove it came back and not just do it go up a weight class and get it done
*  He can still do he's training. He's one of those guys is not just gonna stop training. Yeah, he's been training. He's still training
*  And I know he's he can compete still for us as he's still the best fucking guy he's ever seen
*  He's like the guy's still a fucking man right now in the gym training hard like nobody could touch him
*  Yeah, and I like to test that you know with and I a big respect to George
*  This is no disrespect by any means but there's a reason guys like myself and and I could be we want to fight him
*  Mm-hmm is because we we
*  We want to test ourselves. This is not a matter of disrespect and I want to beat this guy's ass
*  No, it's George was the best. He did everything the right way
*  And got to the top and walked away and he can still do it
*  So we want to test ourselves against a guy like that because we we pride ourselves on being the best
*  We've worked tirelessly to get to this point to where it's not a safe hype. It's not for the money like all that is good
*  Yes, you know that that's great
*  but
*  We want to test ourselves against the best to ever do it and that's what George symbolizes and of course myself
*  I'm easy my weight
*  Now I'm the king he was the king like it's interesting that you would prefer that over Connor because I think the Connor fight
*  Would be the biggest payday, right? Absolutely. I think
*  You don't think so
*  Well, I mean, I don't know red pennies night
*  We all love red pennies. I mean the last pay-per-view they're saying tracked just below Connor and Khabib
*  It's a fucking they think it's more than 2 million pay-per-view bars Wow huge huge his comeback
*  That motherfucker has charisma absolutely and you can't take anything away from Connor man Connor's
*  Put himself in that in that part and that that status to be that guy and even sometimes I have to think
*  I'm like man like that because some guys get envious of that. Like how did he do that?
*  I mean like some guys is just special like that and Connor is that guy? He's special like that
*  Yeah, you know, so he people just gravitate towards him and he you know special guy, but
*  Can you imagine me fighting Connor?
*  Like that wouldn't even be fair
*  It would not be fair. Like I give everyone has a punch his chance, but he would not be fair
*  Like you saw what Khabib did to him at 55 and I imagined me doing that to him at 7 and I'm not just gonna
*  Take him down
*  I'm
*  I'm gonna march forward. I'm gonna hit this guy. I'm gonna beat on him. I'm gonna take him down. I'm going to I
*  Would do some some bad things to Connor and and not just because I it's not that I don't like the guy
*  I mean Connor's Connor. You just think that he's a natural 55
*  Yeah, and he fought at 45 and you would have to chop both your fucking legs off to make 45
*  No, I don't that's yeah when they say impossible that that's absolutely impossible impossible. You'd have to get a tape or him
*  Yeah, it would be it would be bad like you ever seen like you ever seen me at weight get down to weight. Yeah, I
*  Look real African. Don't I you were very thin?
*  You
*  See how Joe said that you're very thin you can tell you're sucking a lot of water
*  But yeah, you know George Lockhart says that big muscular guys like yourself that it's easier for them to cut weight because your muscles
*  Mostly water and that's yeah, and that's the thing I worked with with Cory on is
*  We've we've being able to keep more muscle on now to camp to where it makes that cut a lot easier
*  That's it's so funny because that's sort of and a lot of people's eyes that would be counterintuitive
*  Like he was talking about yo over Mero and he's like that's the perfect body for cutting weight
*  I'm like that is so crazy. Like it looks like the guys got no weight to lose. I
*  Hard to like like a brick. Yeah
*  Yes, like I hug him. I hugged him a couple a couple weeks ago
*  I'm like what well look Rockhold said when he fought him he said it feels like he's made out of steel
*  Yeah, I was like even when you hit him it hurts
*  I can understand that cuz Luke kicked him Luke tore up his legs. Yeah in that fight
*  Yeah, and and then we're in the back and I'm looking at Luke's shin. It's all torn up
*  Yeah, just bleeding cut up like was that before the staph infection? Yeah, is that what causes staph infection?
*  I don't know it could have been cuz I think it was at that same leg his knees
*  I mean his shin rather so fucked up like he's had skin grafts and all kinds of shit
*  It's he still has to put a sleeve over it when he fights. Yeah, you know, it was bad
*  You know good thing is good-looking. He's a handsome devil, isn't he?
*  I mean no little to know
*  It's like confusing and then
*  Fighting so beautiful. Can you imagine a good-looking guy beating you up beating the fuck out of you, too?
*  Not just beating you up like you have zero chance and then kicking you in the head at the same time you wake up
*  What happened? You know that good-looking guy beat you shit out of you beautiful world champion like what that's not supposed beautiful tall
*  perfect bone structure world champion and now you walk through every airport or every a
*  Mall, yeah, and his face is on cologne
*  The zoo lettuce deal blue steel
*  That mean that's what he's doing that writing he's done he's basically done fighting right for now
*  No, you can't you know, Luke is one of those weird guys. You can't just say all it's over
*  You know Luke is one of those guys. I think he can wake up
*  Get up tomorrow on the couch. Yeah, I want to go train
*  Let's take a fight really, you know, I think he's one of those guys and yeah, like I don't think it's not over for him completely
*  I think he could still compete. Don't you think that he should be 185 though?
*  Well, here's my thought looks a big guy. He is a big guy, but here's my thought
*  There should be more weight classes period 85 to 205 is bonkers. The fact there's a 20-pound gap like that
*  That's that's 20 steaks think of 20 steaks
*  That's a giant amount of fucking that's true like you're you're you're talking about two different categories of people
*  Ten pounds is reasonable and you know, obviously boxing is much less
*  You know, they have 54 then they have 60 then they have 68 they have the weird gaps
*  Yeah, box has some strange gaps like a 47 54. It's weird, but I think 10 is good
*  Yeah, I agree with you. But then you know, like look at boxing. Can you do you even know all the weight classes?
*  Can you can you I don't cuz I'm not that much of a fan
*  Yeah, I don't know who the champions are and all the weight classes
*  That's the thing and then it's you know, that's the thing about it is is you know
*  UFC has this mystique right now to where you you know the champions. Yes, you know, there's only a few weight classes
*  Now you start adding to that which I agree. There should be more. Mm-hmm
*  You know does that dilute everything that's going on which I don't think it will because I I thought once
*  you know the UFC went to
*  Change and left Fox or left is that I'm like, oh man, this is gonna die out, you know
*  Oh one day this really I was like, man
*  I don't know if the sports gonna they're gonna keep going the way it is or when they sold to WM
*  Yeah, I don't know if this is gonna keep going and then it's just it's one of those things. It's it's a original sport
*  It doesn't matter where you're at. Everybody speaks fighting. Yes. Well, I felt like when they went to ESPN
*  I'm like Jesus. This is perfect. It's gonna be bigger. I thought it was an amazing move
*  It's gonna be that right now everybody watches ESPN. Yes. I mean, it's on every fucking bar all over the country everywhere
*  It's just too big of a network for okay
*  Also Fox had all sorts of other shit going on to yeah and then fighting yes
*  ESPN is all sports like there's no distraction
*  It's like you go there looking to watch some shit either you want watching a game or you're watching a fight
*  Yeah, and and that's what you know Dana has came out and said that that was the plan
*  That's that's what he wanted to get to I was worried about the ESPN plus shit when they went all pay-per-views to ESPN plus
*  I was like, oh no
*  Disaster but it's not well, I mean when you got guys like Connor, yes
*  You know that he's an outlier that doesn't really right, you know, he can still do numbers
*  But I love it cuz I can watch it on my phone
*  That's what I love cuz sometimes I have to do some family shit or something like that
*  I could sneak away if there's a big fight. Yeah, and I could watch it
*  I just put the headphones on and watch it on my phone
*  But it makes sense because the world the world is shifting to that. Yes, I stream in everything everything is stream
*  So it makes sense for them going that route initially for guys like myself
*  It didn't make sense
*  But you know at the end of the day you just kind of have to do mean in terms of like the amount of money that yeah
*  Yeah, is it a significant cut?
*  Well, initially it's going to be because now you go from where the average Joe just like oh, you know
*  Let's watch some UFC there
*  I see that see it on my cable or just order boom right there order to her now
*  You got to get online and you got to you know order you got to buy this buy the subscription and all of that
*  To where it made it tough because you know, people are lazy people don't want to do that extra work
*  It's like, oh, I can't find this screw it. I don't care about it
*  so of course they hit the numbers are really really hard, but I think eventually it's gonna level out and
*  And you know, it's gonna make sense. Yeah, I think so too
*  I think more people are having those smart TVs where you can just download apps
*  Oh, yeah, I use a Apple TV, which is the shit. You can just get everything get the zone
*  Do you get anything ESPN UFC? It's too much for my brass too much. It's too much. You've got Apple TV
*  You've got Amazon TV. You've got Hulu. You've got Netflix. You've got this like I have ten different subscriptions
*  to and I'm paying for cable do it's like
*  This is crazy this is
*  Trying to battle it out, right? Yeah, everyone's plus and then HBO's got what is HBO's called HBO Max HBO Max
*  And and now they're all like linking up with musical guys as well
*  Like Amazon's got Amazon music one of them is like with Pandora the other ones like with what is it Spotify?
*  Like they're like it's it's a battle right now with all these guys. Yeah, it's it is interesting
*  It's gonna be interesting to see how this all plays out. I was really shocked when HBO got out of boxing
*  I was like, I can't believe that from when I was a kid
*  HBO boxing was this shit. Yeah, Jim Lampley Larry Merchant, you know
*  I mean that that's how it was back in the day
*  It was just you you always knew George Farmer was doing commentary Roy Jones jr. Was doing commentary
*  Yeah, I think when it's when that change of the figureheads change
*  I think that that makes a big difference. Yeah, the people that are calling the shots when they you know, cuz
*  HBO you see that as something that's like a generational type of deal like that's the big boss
*  It's not just you know, yeah, you'd be the boss now. I think that's something that's passed down
*  So when the next guy in line is not
*  You know with boxing and they're gonna slowly pull out with the sport
*  So I think such a tradition boxing on HBO was such a tradition
*  Yeah, it was so it was so part of HBO. Yeah, it was and I mean think
*  Thinking back all those big big fights the Tyson era all George Jones jr. Jr. All that was on HBO. Yeah, and so it's
*  Max Kellerman, it's crazy how he's gone. Yeah, you know, that's weird. Yeah speaking of Tyson
*  You know, I spent some time with him not too long ago. Did you get high as fuck?
*  I
*  Did their podcast and they the hotbox in did you get hotboxed I
*  Think I caught some contact. I'm not gonna lie. They were all smoking in there and I walked out of there feeling lighter
*  Oh, yeah, I felt so much lighter
*  Getting high with Mike Tyson and doing a podcast was one of the weirdest moments of my life really
*  Yeah, man, because I idolized him as a kid and here I am
*  Sitting across from him dude when I was young and Mike Tyson was the champ he was a fucking icon
*  It was different that way. Yeah, but it was back
*  But what I'm saying is like when he was the champ it was different than any other champ people forget the heavyweight division back
*  There was in stagnant. It was stagnant. Nobody cared like Larry Holmes was a
*  Phenomenal boxer but Larry Holmes had beaten Muhammad Ali and no one ever forgave him
*  He beat the fuck out of Ali and it was when Ali was already done and everybody felt sad that now
*  Larry Holmes was the champ and they didn't they didn't appreciate him and then the people that Larry Holmes fought
*  They were kind of lackluster. No one was really no one stood out as being this fucking guy
*  And then when Spanx beat him by decision, it's like the whole division was just stagnant
*  Yeah, and then Tyson came along and it what you weren't even watching a fight. You were watching an execution
*  And you were watching an event like everybody wanted to watch the time and we'd get mad
*  It would only last 30 seconds like fuck. Yes, and that's uh
*  Those guys are special. Yeah, and which is I believe what we're witnessing with Connor
*  You know there comes guys that are special
*  Mm-hmm who may not win all the time because towards the end of Tyson's career didn't win all the time, right?
*  But he was still that special
*  Yeah
*  He was an iconic person and now being able to hang around him and I get that that feeling that you got Joe
*  I get that feeling like I'm so nervous
*  You know, we I sat next to Mike shout out to those guys at the Tyson ranch Rob and all those guys
*  You know every time I spend time with with Mike I
*  It's weird. That's Mike Tyson. He's right there and we talked and he gave us some me and Henry a sahoodo
*  That's I that's like my brother now. We spent some time together
*  He spent some time with Mike and he gave us some crazy advice
*  You know what he said some some, you know important advice because we we see certain situations like now as competitors as fighters
*  We'll be in the gym and your training partner would just beat the shit out of you one day
*  and you will leave you feeling like I
*  Suck I'm not I'm not that good. I'm not this guy. I'm not that good anymore
*  I can't like no, I'm sucking cuz I'm starting to feel that more and more now because when I
*  When I spar for these big fights, I like to make them kind of like an event
*  I want to make them feel like I'm gonna fight
*  So I like to just I don't want music
*  I don't want this I want it to be me and just them and not just when you're in a room and everybody's sparring at
*  The same time it's a different feel you don't really get that adrenaline feel that really you know fight-or-flight mode
*  You know never feel that because there's so much distractions going on so many things so many different sounds that you're hearing
*  But when this excuse me when it's just you and them it's a completely different ballgame, and so I like to make it feel like that
*  So I will get beat up some Saturdays
*  I would just get this
*  beat out of me because I've got maybe three four different guys rotating in on me that my coaches all picked and
*  It sucks when you get in a new guy every round and this guy's just beating on you there
*  You know that my last fight guys were taking me down and holding me down and he's beating on me
*  And I would go home thinking man. I suck like I'm not good anymore like this this sucks
*  How do I deal with this like I'm gonna lose this fight this this sucks
*  But somehow some way you turn you always turn the corner when do you feel like the corner gets turned?
*  Do you have like a you know I know you're you're big on routine
*  But you have it in your head that like somewhere around like six weeks in things start to turn
*  Two and a half three weeks out three weeks out three weeks out from the fight
*  Weeks in the training are you when you threw out what's us particularly? I'm always training, but I like to do like maybe I want to say
*  1110 11 week camp so for eight weeks. Yeah shit might be going bad. Yeah, so you'll have like about eight weeks out
*  I'm feeling good like you know I'm still feeling good. I'm still kind of beating these guys up
*  I'm still kind of doing what I want then six weeks your body's starting to be like oh man, bro
*  We've been training for a while. I'm kind of tired
*  So it's even now and then you're five four weeks out
*  And now you're just getting beat up like these guys are just beating on you your body's tired your body's like I'm done
*  I'm done training. I'm done training like you know I don't want to do this anymore
*  And you were getting beat on and mentally you're thinking to bro. I'm gonna lose this fight. I suck. I'm not good
*  Hmm. I suck and then you I mean you're mad. I suck bad
*  I'm cursing myself in the car bro. That was trash, and I'm of course I'm watching the videos recording
*  How'd you get hit with that you got taken brother your trash you were bad?
*  You're gonna lose you're gonna get knocked out in front of thousands of people bro
*  And then it's like after about three weeks out you start to kind of turn the corner because you getting close and close to the
*  Fight now my mind's like oh, bro. We're getting close to this fight. We're about to fuck this dude
*  And
*  Then you start turning the corner mentally you start getting strong and I started getting stronger and stronger and then at that point
*  I'm okay with
*  Whatever is gonna happen because my training partners just beat the crap out of me for weeks on in and I went through that
*  And we asked Mike like Mike. What do you think about this like he's just normal that feeling like this Mike's like yeah
*  Oh, yeah, that's normal and I and the special way and in his voice
*  There was certain times where you know
*  You you would come in the room in the practice and you'd watch me practice and and you see my training partner
*  Just beat the kick the shit out of me. You think he was the champion
*  You know you would think he was a champion that I was just a scrub in there giving him some rounds
*  But then you take him out there you put him in front of under the lights
*  put 17,000 20,000 people around him and he can't do it and
*  He just can't do it
*  That's what makes champions champions being able to deal and handle all the chaotic stuff that happens before
*  after and what's happening around them and
*  and so I you know that was just like man, you know, he's so right because
*  some guys and I've watched several guys in the practice room beef
*  Doing techniques. It's like how is that even possible like hitting you with crazy stuff?
*  But then you put him in there put him under the lights and
*  Looks like he's an amateur that is one of the weird things about gyms is those guys who are gym killers?
*  Yes inside the gym. They are fucking killers and then for whatever reason they can't do it can't do it
*  My thought is always like can you teach those guys how to keep it together when it comes to a fight or is that just?
*  Something that's inside. It's something that's inside
*  Because I've seen guys that they know like these guys put on clinics inside the practice room
*  But then they get out there they just find a way to lose
*  They find a way to lose they can't deal with it. They can't handle pressure the pressure
*  They can't handle everything that comes with it. They just find a way to lose to where you're just like
*  How is that possible?
*  Even if the guys know we're near their level they find a way to lose
*  Yeah, it's a weird psychological
*  Characteristic that these gym killers have because you would feel like they would have so much confidence
*  Because they do so well in the gym
*  But some guys like the difference between the way they look in the gym and the way they look when they're fighting is
*  Like who are you? Yeah, you're not even the same person. Yeah, you're dropping your hands. You get tired real easy
*  Y'all nervous. It's weird. It goes to it. I think because in the gym, you know, they're familiar with you
*  They know how hard I'm gonna hit him
*  Yeah, they know how if I'm gonna come forward or if I'm gonna back down if they hit me with this this and this
*  You know, so it makes it easier to be safer in the gym
*  Yeah, but then when you got to fight a guy, you don't really know how well he trained
*  You don't know if he's coming for a war or if this guy's coming for a point fight
*  So you don't know all of that all that anxiety plays into it and that it takes a champion's mentality to be able to hone all
*  That control and still go out there do your job and some guys just don't have that in them
*  Yeah, and some guys get really wrapped up in the fear of looking bad yes
*  The looking bad is just like hanging over their head. I'm about to get knocked out. Everyone's gonna laugh
*  I'm gonna be that's very fun of me. They're gonna fuck with me
*  That's very real. Can you imagine me losing a co-e coming to you? That would have been the biggest one, right?
*  So much. Oh my god. It was so bad, man. I'm telling you I'm in different cuts and I'm in Abu Dhabi
*  People run up to me in the mall man. I can't wait for you to kill this guy. I go I'm in Brazil
*  Oh my god, I can't wait for you to kill this guy. I'm in Dominican Republic
*  They can't even speak English, but they're like I can't wait for you to
*  Everywhere so I
*  Imagine me going out there and what I was feeling I had to really I took advice from Rashad
*  I had to really make friends with that feeling and accept it
*  I'll tell you what man at the weigh-ins
*  When Suzy painted the Nigerian flag on your face and you're staring them down and you just had this big smile on your face
*  You look so calm and I was like that guy is ready
*  I yeah, but you were so composed at the weigh-in. I was like, there's no bullshit. There was no fuck you
*  There was no no emotions. You just had a big smile on your face
*  Yeah, I mean, I mean it's at some point you get to the word
*  It's no longer the talking like now I get it you got to sell a fight here and there
*  You know this and that but I try to stay as true to myself as possible
*  Like obviously I understand people want to be entertaining and I'm gonna do the best that I can now of selling a fight without
*  Going too far out of myself
*  But when that when that contract is signed and I know that I have to go in there and take care of business
*  There's no more of that. Like I have to be myself
*  I have to be real and this guy said a lot of things that were very very personal
*  You know a lot of things about my previous manager, you know a lot of things about my team my current manager
*  You know and a lot of things about my my my family my situation as well as far as my father
*  All of that to where it really hit home to where it's the best way for me to teach you a lesson
*  It's not by going in there fighting angry
*  I have to go in there being calculated like my normal self and really teach you a lesson because anything you say
*  Can and will be used against you
*  Inside that octagon, what was he saying to you? He was talking to you
*  I couldn't hear because it was so loud in that the arena when you were waiting. What was he saying to you?
*  I think he was saying I'll be ready. Hope you're ready tomorrow, Junior. Hope you're ready. Hope you're ready. I'm I'm coming
*  Hope you're ready tomorrow. I'm coming. He seems so calm too. He had a big ass smile
*  But you know when I look at these guys, I'm looking for more than just that like I'm reading his body
*  I'm reading everything and he's looking at me the whole time and he did the best because I know he's a competitor
*  He did the best he could to hide his fear
*  You know and and I was afraid too. I'm afraid I'm afraid every one of these fights
*  You've got to be afraid but I make friends with that. I'm okay with being afraid
*  I'm not I'm not worried about I am okay with that
*  So I'm watching him and there's there's a moment if you see that Wayne video
*  We the staredown what you're you know after we staredown we staredown and I'm watching them
*  Watching them the whole time just watching him and he's doing this good job
*  He's trying to stay on me stay on me stay on me stay on me, and then he looks away
*  And I just read his body. I'm just like okay. I know how worried he is
*  I know how worried isn't it weird like you know that your opponent is worried
*  You know everyone's worried right everyone's nervous, but you gotta kind of see it
*  Yes, you could fuck yourself in your mind that this guy's not even scared. Yeah, I'm scared and he's not yes
*  You can mind fuck yourself even though you know it's not even like
*  Everyone before a cage fight has to be nervous absolutely and um and yeah
*  It's weird, but because I'm looking at him, and I'm studying him, and I'm seeing the level of fear that he has and
*  You know I'm trying to assess the level of fear whether it's something I can deal with or something that shit
*  I'm just gonna have to go in and have no choice. You know you look pretty fucking confident
*  He was very confident, but you know I could see
*  Where how superior I was in there to him my level of fear and his level of fear
*  I can see where they were at because
*  And you got to be mindful of his level of fear as well because you a caged animal is very dangerous animal
*  You know and so I can I'm seeing them and that's kind of how the way he that was that went
*  I watched that fight again the other day
*  I was playing it in the gym while I was working out like that is a crazy pace like you fuckers came out guns
*  Blazing I mean it in my opinion is one of the very best welterweight title fights ever
*  I mean it was epic it was epic watching the pace. Yeah, there was I'm watching. I'm watching
*  I'm watching. I'm watching. I'm watching keep it on him keep it on him. I'm watching. I'm watching. I'm watching him boom
*  It looks away. Well. He had to I was talking to yeah
*  I'm like I'm like oh there was just a little moment just to read his spirit
*  I felt his spirit at that moment, and I'm just like it's not the same
*  It's not the same like I'm gonna hurt this kid. It's not the same, but he's gonna come out
*  He's gonna fight, but I'm gonna hurt him
*  You know at no point in that fight that I think I wasn't gonna hurt him when you dropped him in
*  In the the final round when you stopped the fight when you when you dropped him you saw him go down
*  What was going through your head? I was like oh, I'm hitting now
*  I'm hitting cuz I you know when you when you landed a perf you landed punch good
*  You don't really feel it and so at that moment. I was kind of clipping him. I was connected everything
*  I clipped him with
*  Was he was feeling the power at that point hmm?
*  You know I'd heard him a few times before but everyone kept talking about his pace his pace and this and that and I carry
*  Power all the way throughout. That's how I train
*  I the power is gonna be the same the way I hit mitts with my coaches Henry hoofed and all these it's all the same
*  It's not all tap tap tap tap tap here, and then a little bit of power here tap tap tap tap a little bit
*  Yes, I know how to do that
*  I know how to mix it up like boxers do they know how to put a little bit into this
*  Distract you with this then touch you with that
*  I know how to do that too, but I carry the power all the way throughout
*  So by the fifth round when I hit him with the I think I hit him with the body and I hit a punch
*  I hit him with the right hand that stunned him and he stumbled back and at that point
*  I was in I wasn't just in the driver's seat. I'm like okay
*  I'm feeling him and then I hit him with a left foot boom that hurt him
*  I can feel everyone they hurt him because I'm not barely feeling the punches here
*  And then when I put that cannon on his face boom and he went down. I'm just like stay relaxed. They relaxed
*  We got time, you know the goal is to get him out of here
*  I'm not gonna jump on him cuz I've made that mistake before I've dropped the guy now jumped on him going crazy trying to
*  Get him out of there. Let me stay on him
*  Just stay relaxed and I'm gonna get him done and at that point
*  I was just in you get to a certain zone to where you see him coming and he's like
*  Punches are going by and then I land the other one and he drops and I'm just like, okay
*  It's time to get on him and finish him here. Did you recognize that something's wrong with his jaw? Boom. There it is
*  No, I and I I watched the fight over in my coach and my corner told me that his jaw was broken
*  I didn't even hear them boom that second right hand. I didn't even hear them
*  Were you surprised the way they stopped the fight? No
*  No, but you know and I and this is this is what I'm saying is um
*  I gotta say I was a little surprised when I look he's yeah
*  I mean you you think about it like that and it's like oh man, he got up right right away
*  You know like it was might have been an early stoppage
*  But then you few few watch that last like that 30 second before that you see the shots that he was taking
*  Like I hit him with that right hand boom. He stumbled back almost fell down
*  Then I was wondering if they knew that his jaw was broken. I
*  Mean that's been a referee the right you know, you know, I but I I personally didn't
*  But if you see him take shots like that
*  You just got dropped twice right and now you're holding on to a leg and now this is just an ear muff
*  You're trying to protect yourself and I'm having no signs of stopping
*  You know, that's the referee's job to get in there and stop you, you know, and I know some guys are like, oh well
*  They should have let him go. It's a title fight
*  You should have let him get knocked out completely or this and that you know
*  But it's a referee's not doing his job of protecting you if that happens
*  It's interesting that you said every fight takes a little bit out of you
*  Yes, and that's I think that's important for people to hear because I you know, we've all seen fighters and
*  You know, like we go to boxing the perfect examples
*  Meldrick Taylor when he fought Julio Cesar Chavez. Did you ever see that fight? No
*  Tremendous fight Meldrick Taylor was winning the fight
*  But Chavez just kept the pressure on kept the pressure on was beating his body beating his body
*  Kept the pressure on him and then finally with like literally I think the fight was stopped with four seconds to go
*  Wow, yeah, Richard Steele waved it off and Meldrick Taylor stood up and he talked to him
*  But you could tell Meldrick Taylor was out of it and they stopped the fight Meldrick Taylor was never the same again
*  It was never the same again. Terry Norris start them after that. He started slurring his words. It was real bad
*  It was like that one fight took everything out of them. Yeah, there's a
*  There's something people don't really see is I mean everyone's attracted to violence
*  Everybody wants to see the violence. They want to see you get hit
*  I want to see you hit someone they want to see the blood, you know
*  But people don't see what this takes away from your spirit each fight win or lose. It takes something from you
*  Like only myself and Kobe Covington are gonna know what that fight did to us
*  Now could I do it? I can do it again next week. I have no problem doing it yet
*  But each and every fight takes something away from you
*  But
*  balanced out more so for sure if you take a beating right, but if is it balanced out by
*  hard training and recuperation to where you can maintain the exact same level or is every fight you're like slightly
*  Less good than you were before but you're so much better that you still have enough leeway
*  That no that as far as the preparation and training all of that stuff. Yeah that accounts
*  It takes away from you but I'm saying the act of actually fighting the fight
*  From your spirit from your energy that takes away from you
*  So you mean like your ability to get up for it?
*  Yes, your your ability to fight another man
*  Your ability to that bravado to fight another person that spirit that killer spirit
*  It takes away from you where and it could add to it
*  It changes that spirit in some shape form or fashion it absolutely does
*  It's there's this video a while back. I forget the fighter. He was a wrestler turn fighter. He's like bleach blonde hair
*  I forget his name, but I think the video was called unfaded glory
*  I think USA wrestling made it put it together and it had all these wrestlers on it, but
*  You know Brandon Slay Travell DeLogna who was my teammate a lot of different
*  You know was on that video and I watched that while I was training for the 2012 Olympics trying to make the team
*  And that video stays with me changed my mentality or how to think because it really put things in perspective
*  Because you go out there and you battle this hard match and you lose to this guy like Joe
*  I've won hundreds of wrestling matches. I can't remember hardly any of them
*  the ones that I've lost though, I
*  remember most of them
*  Why is that?
*  Because each one took something away from my spirit somehow I
*  Remember each the one they took something away from me like I can tell you really
*  The fights that I won the MMA fights. I can really yeah, I don't really care that much about I win and I move on
*  But the one that I lost oh, yeah, I know exactly why I knew what happened on you
*  I you know what happened in that fight
*  Do you remember when you had that fight with Damien Maya and early in the fight Damien Maya is kind of standing and holding
*  On your back. Yes, and the referee separated you. Yeah
*  Were you like thank God that fucking referee?
*  No, because I wasn't gonna give that there's no way he was I was prepared to stand there the whole round
*  Like but didn't you think that that was a weird way to separate you it was?
*  When he did eventually separate yeah, the timing wasn't very good
*  No, because at some point we stood there we were there for like almost a minute
*  But it's hard to get to that position on a guy like it is it's it's very I mean that Damien people don't realize
*  How good like in Ben Askren found out the hard way? Yeah, how good this guy is and yeah
*  I could have taken him down whenever I wanted and tried to play that game, but that's that that's not a game you play
*  right, it's like trying to swim with sharks and
*  And you're you're you're a little bit shark yourself, but you're trying to swim with these mammoth sharks
*  Yeah, and it just it doesn't you know Damien Maia is just that guy to where I'm like why even flirt with this right?
*  Why his jujitsu? It's just so so high level. It's so high level. It's so tricky
*  I mean, he's just done it so much and so well to where he's just he's good in certain positions the words
*  Like I'm like you know what there's no point in even going there, but I was prepared to die
*  Rather than let him take me down and go down here
*  Yeah, you know even though we never know I might have been able to defend down there on the ground
*  Which I worked a lot on that on my defense down there like my ground
*  Remember Roy, yeah, Roy McDonald. I would prefer fully prepared to do that. You know, but why Masvidal did as well?
*  Yeah, he did a good job of you know not getting submitted. Yeah, you know like but at the end of the day
*  You know, he still took a L now
*  I'm just saying well, I know you have to say that you are you like are you in
*  conversation with the UFC about your next fight or do you just
*  Rest up heal up and then let them know. Hey, I'm good to go. No
*  You know if they're like, hey, does this date work?
*  Alright, if it does it does if it doesn't it doesn't but I'm not
*  I've worked to get to the point where now I don't have to call guys out. I'm not trying to pick fights
*  Oh, no, I want that fight. I want that fight. I'm right. Oh this guy been begging for this guy to fight me
*  No, like the belt has to move
*  Like it has to move so when the UFC says okay here this is the next fight. Hey, that's the next fight
*  I've never turned down a fight. So you haven't had any conversation with them at all where they said hey, you know
*  When do you think you'll be ready? Like have you had any of these kind of conversations? I mean Dana we've talked
*  yeah, you know my management we've we've talked about it and
*  Yeah, I've told them when you know, I'll be ready like I'll be ready. Give me a month
*  You know let this thing you know heal out because I mean you can see I can make a fist now
*  You know let this thing heal out and I'm cracking and what is the conversation that they have with you? Do they say hey?
*  We would like you to fight X guy
*  Here why yeah
*  No, they put out the guys and and um, let's be you know
*  Not being a hitter. Let's be honest like if you really look at the division
*  I've kind of beaten almost everybody there in that top, you know top ten
*  You know, it's a it's a matter of who everybody really wants who they think it's next and Dana agrees Dana thinks that
*  What's his name?
*  George George is the next guy and
*  You know, I have no problem with that. I told Dana Dana
*  I've never turned down a fight you say when and you say who and let's get that money
*  Will you try to make it for both belts?
*  I want to see you
*  If you beat him have you thrown that thing in the closet, you know, I absolutely will do that now
*  I'm gonna tell me that would be I'm gonna think of this
*  I'm gonna tell Dana Dana. I need that. No, you know what don't even make me a new one. I want his
*  Yeah, take that give it back to me. I want that but that's always weirded me out that you don't get that person's belt
*  You get a new belt. I'm like, but I make the belt now. It may it makes sense
*  I guess cuz then someone's holding on to it. Yeah. Yeah, it makes fun call over it and shit
*  Yeah, I don't want the same, you know that dirt. I don't know what they've done with that thing
*  Tim Silvia when he won the heavyweight title, he used to wear his belt everywhere. He would go to clubs
*  He'd wear his fucking UFC belt. I said that I would do that. I
*  Said that I would do that
*  Because I guys I hear a lot of guys like Mike Tyson said he wore his I was at the WBC
*  Word for like a week straight shower me I think there's a picture of him in a shower with it and uh,
*  And I was like, yeah, I'm gonna do that when I get it. But then I got it and I went home like this no fucking way
*  It does seem kind of crazy to do pop us you can fuck up the leather, right? Yeah, they just it's so so nice
*  I'm like, ah and my daughter like had it for like a couple days like just laid next to it
*  She likes looking at it. I'm sure and she's I told her her friends at school
*  Damn, my daddy has a gold belt. How crazy is that for her? Like my daddy's the champion of the world
*  Yeah, but she doesn't really understand that. I mean she under she knows that that I'm the champion
*  She sells it tells me all the time. Yeah, you know and it's the cute
*  I'm so soft for her dude when you brought her into the octagon when you beat Tyron and you're holding her
*  I almost cried. I every time I see that, you know
*  I always said I'm not gonna be that guy cuz you know parents like thousands of pictures on their phones of the kids
*  I'm like, I'm never gonna be that guy. I have literally I looked the other day
*  I had 4500 pictures and I guarantee that maybe four thousand of them are of my daughter
*  Of course, and then uh, you know, and I was I'm thinking I'm like man when she grows up, which is why?
*  like some guys yeah, you can switch up to be an entertainer, but I can't switch up too much because
*  At some point my dogs and grow up one day is gonna be like who's that guy?
*  Why did you say that?
*  That's the picture and oh man, I look at it and I just want it. Uh
*  Well, you could see how happy you were how proud you were in her she was smiling man. That's an intense moment
*  That's such an intense moment when she grows up, but you know, I want her to be able to look at that
*  Do you have a picture of that? Are you holding her or while they gave you the belt?
*  They're making me one damn that yeah, they're making of course
*  I'm gonna frame one and I have one two. I have a picture of
*  I have a picture of the and the one that gets me the most and I think he was shot by a
*  photographer Eric Coleman is
*  I was we were training on the track and he was
*  before I fought noise right after I fought the finale Ultimate Fighter and
*  I just got into the UFC and she's in a in a stroller and
*  We came right from it Saturday morning workout
*  we had to go to FAU track and the team guys are running I couldn't really run so I'm hitting mitts with Henry and
*  She's in the stroller. I took her straight out of bed
*  she's in the stroller sitting there watching me and I'm hitting mitts and
*  Shot the shot and somehow got her in the back. She's just in the stroller
*  she's like maybe two years old if that and
*  just watching me train and
*  That that one is the one that when I look at I can't help I can't fight those emotions because
*  That was and and the worst thing was that was the camp where I was having the most issues
*  To where I literally a couple of times I cried
*  Physically cried because I can I'm like man my career is just starting and I can't even walk upstairs
*  Like my career is already done. I tell people what you told me about not being able to walk on the concrete
*  You had to walk on grass
*  That bad and I come down because I go down the stairs backwards and everyone's kind of like why you do that?
*  Why you do that? You still do that? Yeah, I still do that really
*  Yeah, it takes pressures off takes pressure off my knees and so I still do it the longest
*  I now it's a mental thing the longer I can preserve my knees the better, you know
*  And that's the thing too is my manager makes fun of my yeah, but my man my manager makes fun of me
*  He's like, oh man, you all heard you walk like an old man
*  But then you cross into that cage and you fight like and I'm like, yeah because
*  When I cross that barrier in my mind, I turn into the Nigerian nightmare. I don't give a shit what happens
*  I'm ready to die in here. I don't care
*  I'm gonna sacrifice my body completely in here to accomplish this goal
*  Do you worry about your knees not being able to hold up because obviously your mind is strong enough that you could fight even
*  Knowing you're in pain not being able to fighting. Yes. Yes
*  Not so much no, no because I mean it's it's
*  I've been making this decision for a long time
*  I remember the first knee surgery I had in college and I just my thing my mind was I just can't wait to get back
*  What gets me back the fastest? Oh scope just take just I snip it out
*  Whatever gets me back to fast because I just can't wait to compete
*  I think as long as I have this burning desire to compete I'm okay with sacrificing my body
*  But once this desire starts to kind of dwindle down
*  I'm okay. Well when you see a guy like Michael Bisping who's
*  Michael's like 41 maybe how old is Michael? I think he has in his 40s. I think and he just had a knee replacement
*  You know when you see that does that make you think like fuck is that gonna be me? Yeah, I mean I'm already I'm okay with that
*  I've made friends with that really I've made friends with the fact that I'm gonna probably have to have my knees both replaced
*  She's gonna have my shoulders probably done your shoulders are fucked up, too
*  I mean just for I'm a wrestler just for I'm wrestling over time like my back at some point
*  I'm gonna have to get done. I've made I've made friends with these
*  You know with these like I'm gonna have to do these and you don't even mind
*  That's interesting you don't mind talking about these injuries
*  You don't mind talking about cuz you feel like it's still not gonna save them. I don't give a shit
*  Yeah, I don't need time gonna save you like guys all his knees are bad
*  Yeah, my knees were real bad before Kobe my knees were real bad before Damien
*  My reason real bad before Tyron or the other guy doesn't matter once I cross in and I get in when I'm locked into that cage
*  You're trying to hurt me, but I'm gonna hurt you worse and
*  Know these guys right now like everybody has their time Tyron had his time
*  You know George had his time
*  You know right now God is just saying this is my time and I'm gonna maximize it to my ability
*  So I don't care. I'm gonna give everything in there just cuz of my knees you can know it's my knees
*  I people kick me all the time Kobe kick me a few times. I don't give a shit. It's not gonna save you
*  It's not gonna save these guys and and with Kobe as well. I mean he
*  You know that fight was a lot more personal than a lot of people think you know obviously with
*  you know the the whole situation with my my dad and him I'm saying whatever he said and
*  And I know he like people say certain things and Connor's a master at this to try to get you off your game
*  To try to make you to rattle you make you mad enough to where you come out. You're just crazy
*  You know fighting them and to where you could be the best conditioned athlete
*  You can get in there and get an adrenaline dump. You look like you haven't trained a day
*  And I knew that's what they would like I'm not stupid I knew what that's what these guys were trying to do
*  I knew that's what especially him he was trying to do, but I wasn't gonna play into that
*  He had a very steady pace. It was very interesting
*  You could see that when you're fighting like right away in the first round first of all his pace is fucking crazy
*  I mean that guy throws a lot of volume
*  But you you had you could tell that you were not gonna blow your water early
*  You were fighting very measured very disciplined and you were throwing a lot of front kicks to the body man that front kick to the
*  Body's nasty. Yeah, I mean not you know just looking at his style stylistically and
*  matching both with mine
*  Like I could have came in there we could have wrestled
*  Yeah, everyone thought they just gonna wrestle each other you know, but did you think that was possible?
*  But he's gonna try to wrestle with you more
*  Mmm
*  You know there was a possibility of him trying to wrestle, but I knew that he was worried about my wrestling
*  because
*  Everyone tyrant was a two-time all-american tyrant ty tyron did better than him in division one wrestling better accolades
*  And we saw what happened with that fight
*  So I knew he was worried about me wrestling me taking him down because if I take you down you're not getting up unless
*  I let you up, so I knew he was worried about that
*  But then they came a moment in the fight to where we just looked at each other, and it was just like
*  No
*  Not today
*  Let's do it. Let's do it and and I was fully aware
*  I was fully prepared to bang it out with him
*  It was very surprising because it really did turn out to be basically a kickboxing fight. Yeah, I mean that was
*  Yeah, we just we just looked at each other and was just like all right. Let's do it. Mano, Emano
*  Let's go you know it's not gonna be wrestling tonight
*  So let's do it man
*  They could you the two you guys together depending on how the rest of the division stacks up because it's just such a fucking
*  Talented division there's so much talent in that division. There's so many good fighters, but depending on how everything plays out
*  You guys could have two or three fights
*  easily
*  We'll see yeah
*  I mean we'll see first of all I want to see how you bounce it back from that because like I said
*  There was a lot that went into that fight he said a lot he did a lot like getting all that weight on having all
*  That weight on your shoulders
*  Saying all the things that you said ruffling all the feathers that you ruffled and then coming out and and he took a beating
*  From the fans after that like the backlash that he took
*  Oh, yeah, it was was I don't know if you saw some of the shit that was online like he took a humongous
*  Oh, I'm sure and and rightfully so I mean you that's the game. Yeah, that's the game
*  That's the game you want to talk crazy shit, then they're gonna
*  I mean that the reason why they're tuning into the fight so so many of them
*  Yeah, is because of all the crazy shit you've talked
*  Yes, so naturally if he loses all the people that were rooting for you like yeah
*  I can do it. I knew it. Yeah, and so I want to see how he bounces back from all that because he's never had to
*  Don't do it before psychologically. Yeah. Yeah, he's never had to do it before
*  He's never had to talk all that shit then go in there and get your mouth shut literally and it's literally it's gonna be interesting
*  To see like who they match him up with you know, I mean who do they I mean he's got possibilities
*  Oh, yeah, I'm asked with all yeah for sure. You know, he can find mass with all they used to be boys, right?
*  Yeah, they used to be boys used to be training partners in this videos online of me
*  You see what he was doing the mass without early on I?
*  You know like there's videos online with with with that of and then it's like
*  He can fight Tyronne Willie like Tyronne wins this fight. Like I think they both fight for the number one contender. Hmm
*  you know, so it's
*  It is what it like the possibilities are endless for him because there's so many guys that want to kick his ass
*  Yeah, so many guys in the division
*  But I don't think so a lot of guys in division can kick his ass, right?
*  You know, so it's he's got he's you know, he's got possibilities
*  He can he could fight guys and it's also possible that he can learn from that fight with you and come back a better
*  Fighter that is possible. So we don't know how much it's gonna take out of him
*  But it is possible that he could come from that
*  I mean that was a fucking crazy fight and that was the first really crazy fight that he's experienced other than the one submission
*  Lost that he had in the UFC where he had a he had an injured rib. He had to take the fight
*  Was that warly alves warly alves? Yeah, so when you when you see him next then we'll get a we get an understanding
*  Yeah, but the thing though is
*  There's just some certain guys you can't be I
*  Don't know what it is or why it is. There's just certain guys that you cannot be and
*  I think I'm that guy that he's just not gonna be I will not allow myself to lose to him
*  Do you think if you had two good hands of your hand wasn't hurt?
*  It would have been a different fight. You love to hurt him. I think I heard him earlier
*  But man hats off to him. He's a tough guy. I don't take anything away from me fought a very good fight
*  Had to be the most satisfying the most I've ever been hit ever
*  Yeah, he was hitting me. He was touching me and and it was I was never really hurt bad
*  But they were stinging shots like they stung me a couple times like this mother
*  touching me
*  Touching me, but at no point that I was like I'm gonna come forward. I'm gonna hurt him
*  He's a fucking swinger man. I mean he throws a lot of shots to his volume is incredible
*  But that had to be the most satisfying to you it was when I when I got back to the hotel and I and I sat
*  there it's just I
*  Mean it was like and I just was about myself because I like to decompress and I'm just like
*  We got it done I mean all this shit that this guy said even my dad was you know, like say
*  Go take care of business, you know and to know that I went in there and I and I did take care of business
*  Was extremely satisfying and it didn't hurt went up freaking I mean a surplus of like celebrities crazy
*  You know you attach yourself to that whole MAGA thing and you know
*  There's a lot of people that will support you because of that. Yeah, man
*  There's so many like if you fall down there's so many they just can't wait to piss on you and kick you. Oh, man
*  Yeah, it's such a polarizing position that he took he did but uh, you know
*  I'm friends with the Trump now
*  You were saying that you were gonna go visit the White House and you tell me about the boy
*  Yeah, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to the White House, but you also
*  about it
*  I
*  picked up the book and
*  You know initially was like, okay
*  Cuz this guy tried to troll me during our press conference was trolling me like he sat there while I was talking
*  He was reading the book and pretending like he was reading the book. Yeah, and and um, and
*  Then I'm at the airport and I'm like, oh
*  There's the book
*  And I'm like fuck it I've got time today
*  And
*  I'm trolling them and I and I buy the book. I'm like screw it
*  I'm gonna buy this book
*  So I actually buy the book and and I take the screenshot and I and I posted it
*  She did see the reaction for fans after that. It was it was huge ridiculous
*  Did Donald Trump Jr. Reach out to actually? Yeah, I we actually you know
*  messages back
*  Oh
*  Yeah, it's fucking hilarious message
*  Uh, you know, and I don't know the trumps personally
*  So I you know, I can't go out there and like oh I'm bashing them just because this idiot was attaching himself
*  Yeah them, you know, so I look forward to meeting them and you know
*  Actually listen that would be a great moment for you to bring that title to the White House despite of all the bullshit
*  Yeah, and just let everybody know you you rise. Yeah, I mean
*  Who would ever imagine that I you know coming from the village in Africa that I did, you know and and getting to this point and
*  Actually going in there to the White House
*  well, you know, we had talked about your dad and your dad being in jail and
*  Of all people man Kim Kardashian has had I think something like 28 people
*  wrongly accused released from prison
*  She's all about like prison justice reform and she makes these regular trips to the White House to talk to the president about prison
*  Reform and about getting people out of jail that that got bad deals. Yeah, and I mean that's that's a worthy cause
*  It's amazing cause I stopped making fun of her. Yeah
*  I'm not gonna make fun of her anymore. She's a she's doing great things. Yeah, she's a good person
*  You know, and I mean like I don't know that family personally
*  So, you know, I could have never really speak on them
*  But for someone to come out and actually because there's so many people that are behind bars
*  Yeah
*  because of some stuff of being wrongfully accused and the fact that she a
*  Celebrity like her of her stature is really shedding light on that and actually taking the steps to to go out and actually help some
*  Of these guys. It's just amazing. It's amazing and and speaking of my father
*  Like I said, like this is no accident that we're here like like life is this is no accident Joe
*  like the last time I was here, you know was the first time I ever talked about it and open up about it and
*  This attorney great test
*  Out of South Florida actually contact that means like hey, you know
*  I would love to take a look at the case and you know, look at what's going on here
*  and so, you know, he's kind of been like looking into it working on it and you know sending the letters that need to be sent and
*  making the calls that need to be made and
*  Joe the moment I just walked in here and I this is no lie. Just showed you the text
*  I just walked in here and I'm in the bathroom and I get the text that says he's gonna be released soon
*  That's incredible. It's like that's incredible
*  You should bring them with you to the White House. I
*  Will definitely try dude. I will definitely try no wild that would be man
*  You know the big thing to me that would mean so much to me is that my dad front and center for my fight
*  Having my dad come into the cage and put that belt around me
*  That that would be there's these moments in life that I call it like being floored
*  and that's just when my your heart hits the floor and I think
*  Those moments arrive and which is what for me when you think about the pursuit of happiness
*  These are the definitions of that is when you can you can make your parents heart hit the floor
*  yeah by doing something like
*  Doing something to where you're recognized so much to where they're recognized for the work that they did raising you
*  The good work that they did, you know, whether it's winning the you know
*  Road scholar where this winning a Nobel Peace Prize
*  I can you imagine as a parent watching your child accomplish something great like that?
*  Feeling is the feeling that I long for I long I want I want to make my parents feel that as many times as possible
*  before they're called home and they pass from this earth and
*  And I'm sure my daughter at one point is gonna want to do that
*  And you know, I think winning that title and I would have loved to see my dad's face when I won that title
*  And just and just look into him and see how he felt
*  So I can't I can't wait for him to be at the next one. I can't wait for him to actually
*  Feel that how long has it been locked up for I think since 2009
*  11 years I think yeah, and and
*  My dad did miss beat to like you go see him. My dad's the same guy
*  Really? The same guy you would think this is something I would defeat somebody that would crush them and kill him
*  And of course, I'm not with him day in and day out
*  But my dad's still the same guy to me. And so man, you know
*  I'm not gonna cry but I
*  Can't I can't wait for him. I can't wait for him to actually
*  Hold my dad again. If you could choose who would you like to see him cage side?
*  When you fight who would you like to be fighting when he's there for the first time?
*  If I could choose if you could choose would it be red panties night? Oh man, that's a toss-up
*  Connor can get it too
*  But you know at the same time it's it's his choice
*  Connor is work to get to the point where if Connor decides I want to get my ass kicked by Ouzman
*  That's his choice
*  You know
*  He has the right to make that decision because he put himself in that position
*  You know, but it's not a fight that I'm gonna beg for that I really want
*  But I think someone brought it after my last fight that I'm sitting at right under George's record from most consecutive wins in the welterweight division
*  And I think I'm like one behind
*  And so I think imagine me breaking that record fighting the guy that has the record
*  That that would be insane I think besides Connor that's the biggest fight
*  The other the other biggest fight to make is could be if could be decided to go up to 170
*  Yeah, I would never fight could be really. Yeah
*  that's that's my brother I
*  You know, it's just it's just like a mutual respect where I I don't see myself ever
*  I don't see myself ever fighting could be I don't see myself ever fighting Israel
*  You know, even though a lot of people have kind of be hinting towards it
*  They're like, yeah, you guys need to fire you guys need to fire. I don't see myself fighting him, you know
*  There's plenty of people having to yeah plenty of people having two belts in Nigeria is better than just having one guy holding two belts
*  Yeah, we say yeah. So yeah, there's no there's no desire there man. That's my guy. I'm a giant fan of him
*  Oh my god, everything about him
*  Everything is hilarious
*  Personality he could be a huge huge super superstar globally. Oh, he will be I think he will be he really could he really could mean
*  He's got everything first of all his striking is some of the most intricate
*  Complex and creative striking I've ever seen just
*  Angles and fluid. Yeah, just the way switches stances and sets you up and leaves traps and yes
*  And I'm now and I'm a fan of I'm a fan of a lot of UFC fighters almost every US like UFC fighters
*  I'm a fan of it, especially now getting into the analyst work too
*  Like I get to actually have to watch some of these guys that are just making their debuts and things like that
*  so I'm a fan of a lot of these guys not just the champions and
*  You know Israel is he's special. He's special and I'm I get kind of envious. I'm like damn
*  I wish I could do that shit. I wish I could do this whip my hands around the way
*  he does it and the way he you know, throws this little that little question mark cake and the
*  I'm a fan of these guys and Israel is one of those guys that's special and the same Francis. I'm a fan of Francis
*  I want to be able to swing at somebody even if the punch doesn't land
*  They fall over. I want to be able to have power like that Francis's powers preposterous. It doesn't make sense. It's preposterous
*  Yes, it doesn't make you know
*  Well, he's his power kind of makes sense because he's so big and you see him hit hard
*  You know who makes no sense Deontay Wilder. Yeah Deontay Wilder freaks me out man
*  That's he foreheads guys block and they just go like like they just get shut off
*  I don't think I've ever seen a heavyweight boxer punch like that guy because you know when he fought Tyson Fury
*  Throw that punch. Yeah, the way that straight, right? Oh my god
*  I don't think any people everyone's ever thrown that cuz the straight right it's a it's a power punch
*  But it's not it's not really considered the powerful punch that puts you out like a hook right or a deadly uppercut
*  He hits you in the face like anywhere in the face. You go unconscious. It doesn't have to eat your jaw
*  It's when Louis Ortiz is on the ground going what in the fuck and you watch that fight again
*  You watch the punch land it landed on his forehead. Yeah, it's crazy
*  And the way he set him up to it's just like which which makes it very intriguing to see this Tyson Fury, too
*  Oh my god, so intriguing the way he set that punch up the guys got
*  42 fights
*  40 knockouts
*  One draw one decision. What the fuck? I mean who?
*  Who the fuck has that that is crazy?
*  Insane in the history the heavyweight boxing division
*  There's never been a guy like that who starches everybody the only one he didn't starch this Tyson Fury and
*  That other dudes ever ever ever and then he fucked him up in the rematch
*  Crazy rematch rematch was crazy. I mean, I mean he basically just swung on him
*  Yeah, you know, it's like he threw boxing out the window once you had him hurt
*  I
*  Call that hood fight
*  You just try to you just try to get him off get him out of it. Do you want to he's on another level?
*  He is the way he lands that punch. It's unreal
*  But you get Tyson Fury man, like and I wasn't I wasn't a fan of Tyson Fury
*  I wasn't I was just like because I come from the era of watching guys like Mike Tyson who?
*  Was just there to bang it out and boxing but Tyson Fury the way that he boxes makes you miss slips
*  And yeah, just rolls punches and it was just like if our guy was six nine goofy. Look, yes
*  He's so crazy acts goofy to he's got that goofy personality
*  But to watch him box is beautiful. It's beautiful. It's it's amazing and just big respect to him and just
*  That's off the deck
*  That 12th round I was at home like oh shit. He knocked him out and the 12th round
*  Lazarus possess. Yeah
*  Just up and you didn't even wobble. Yeah, he's like, I'm good. I'm good and arguably won the rest of that round
*  Yes. Yes stunned him. That's on D. It was it was crazy. It was crazy to me crazy to me
*  I can't wait to see that second fire. Oh, that's gonna be interesting that heavyweight boxing division is fucking very very interesting
*  It is those top. I want to say top five guys. I was very sad for Andy Ruiz though
*  I was like, you know
*  It's one thing if Joshua came back with a great game plan and beat him
*  But it was also like Andy's preparation was so bad. I wasn't sad for him. I was disappointed in him. Yeah
*  Like that's a better way. I was extremely extremely disappointed. Yeah, it's like who in your corner
*  Who in your circle is that big of an idiot?
*  That can't make you take this seriously because the only way to guarantee that you get another big payday is to go out there
*  And win that fight. Yeah, because now you're still the champion like the big payday has got to come, right?
*  But now for you is gonna avoid no one cares. Yeah. Yeah, no one cares now people might not even fight you again because you're tough fight and
*  They get nothing out of beating you but there's also something about like
*  Mexican boxing is so
*  deeply rich with tradition and
*  Mexican fighters are so proud like if you go back and think about all the great
*  Mexican champions when a Mexican fighter falls short or they don't show heart like look at Julio Cesar Chavez's son
*  Julio Cesar Chavez jr. Bro, they shit on that guy hard
*  Yeah, but I think that last fight I think that come I feel like he's quit in the last couple of fights
*  Yeah, but I think
*  Some people just can't handle the expectations. I think what upon you there's that but I think with him and I
*  Mean he might be doing it for the wrong reason exactly
*  It's almost like you shouldn't have even been in boxing in the first place. He grew up rich
*  How do you mean your dad is one of the greatest boxers of all time?
*  He's a huge superstar and you're following in his footsteps. I mean Julio Cesar Chavez is a fucking savage
*  Yeah, I mean there that his dad was one of the all-time greats
*  Yes, and to just to fall short with that guy as your dad
*  I mean that has got to be so it's just gonna be so hard to follow his footsteps
*  but that's the thing is and I think that's where dads could do a better job of of
*  Making the kids being okay with not actually having to do what I did
*  Yeah, you know, you don't have to be you know a boxer or a champion boxer
*  And I know it's it's easier said than done because as men we want to want our kids
*  We want we want that bond with our kids
*  Yeah
*  you know we want to see our kids do what we did and do it better and so we can be there seat there and be
*  Proud of them, but you know, he didn't necessarily have to box
*  No, and and you know the worst part of that whole situation is you chose to box
*  Yeah, but you're not all the way in we missed weight too. Yeah, he's done that before
*  He I think he missed weight for the Canelo fight. Yeah, it's really crazy cuz he's a good fucking puncher
*  He's a tough guy. He's a big guy, but for whatever reason
*  You know, it's have you ever thought about a boxing match like you know, you see have you really?
*  I actually thought I was going to instead of MMA. I actually wanted the box really
*  yeah, cuz I was living at the Olympic Training Center and
*  and my girlfriend at the time was an Olympic boxer and
*  Whoa, yeah, and so I
*  Was like man this wrestling thing is not really working out because I've been hurt a few times and it's hurting my motivation
*  To want to be Olympic champion wrestler so I can tell my motivation was starting to die down
*  And I'm like, what else can I do like I but I still want to compete and of course, you know
*  dating a boxer and having this kind of watch them now you start to be engulfed in what they're doing in the preparation and I'm
*  Deeply enriched in it now to where and I was already a boxing fan
*  But now I might you starting to learn what's going on
*  And I'm like, maybe I should just come back and box for the next four years and try to make the Olympic team and go
*  with the Olympics
*  But then I'm like wait
*  So I'm gonna throw away this skill that I just worked spent 10 almost 10 years perfecting and learning
*  Just throw that away and then just start a new sport
*  Off the rip. You're an idiot. How old were you at the time? I might have been what?
*  23 24 so now you've been striking for many many years now. Yeah, and so
*  When you see something happen like with Connor and Floyd Mayweather. Yeah, if something like that comes your way
*  Would I take it? Would you take it?
*  Absolutely
*  Know that the issue that the thing with that is a lot of people are gonna say no
*  You can't box. I you can't box like these guys. No, listen at the end of day
*  No, I'm not conditioned to be able to box like them to be able to go 12 3-minute rounds
*  Even though yes MMA rounds of 5 minute rounds might be more intense than those three minute rounds
*  But it's different conditioning. Yeah to be able to slip punches move and throw punches and block punches and be efficient
*  Efficient and comfortable
*  It's it's a it's man. It's hard work to where we go MMA fighter
*  We go into boxing you do four rounds you feel like you want to die
*  To where a boxer can come into it, you know MMA and might not even be able to get through a round, right?
*  You know, it's just different mechanics, you know, just being able to work the mind and relax the mind to get the work done
*  It's different. Yeah, if I got an opportunity I
*  Would definitely give it a I would definitely give it a try because I mean that's that's part of being a champion
*  It's taking on new challenges and and going out there and giving it your best shot
*  Well a fight like that would be Canelo right because Canelo just won the 175 pound title
*  You try to throw me to the wolves, I mean that would be the big fight
*  I mean, I'm not trying to throw you to the walls
*  But they came with you the big that big Floyd Mayweather money to fight Canelo
*  Like if they started doing I would give it I would give it my all I think I would take that absolutely
*  Yeah, I think I would take would you like one fight first though
*  Would you like a boxing match first before you because I think like Connor when Connor fought Floyd Floyd?
*  I would I would uh, yeah
*  But I would of course I would spar with I get some big-time boxes in there to spar with me and it really helped
*  Me prepare how much time would you need? Because what I'm saying is like Floyd was a gene. Oh, he gave
*  He gave Connor a very short window time to get ready. Yeah, Floyd was like, yeah, I'll give you like six
*  I was a mess, but but Floyd's a master. He's a mastermind. Yeah, that's his game. That's his world
*  He knows what he's doing. If you were gonna fight a real like legit boxer Canelo
*  Can I Jacob's something like that? Yeah, six months six months. Yeah six months six months to be confident in my preparation
*  To just go out there and do I mean, yeah, of course I could do it in less time
*  But but six months for me to do it right to feel confident
*  Going in there to box a boxer not and not saying that I would definitely win. No, it's me
*  I'm gonna give it my all like I'm gonna come you nothing to just walk over me you gonna fill me
*  No, I'm not trying to set you up with a big fight
*  But what I'm saying is what with Zufa boxing right now because the UFC is getting involved in boxing
*  Absolutely, and they do have some plans on promoting some big boxing matches and perhaps having some crossover fights
*  Like Terrence Crawford is talking about fighting. He's like I'll fight you one boxing match with Connor
*  He's like I'll fight you one boxing match and we'll fight you one MMA match I think he can do it
*  I think Terrence could do anything. I mean you see his kid his kids are wrestlers. Yes. Yes
*  Yeah, you know from Omaha you from you know that Midwest you touched the mat a couple times
*  You've wrestled a bit and his hands
*  Dude that guy and that guy switches up as good as anybody on the planet
*  That's the thing I was gonna say is you know, that's the guy that I like to watch a lot to
*  Boxing he's an artist some you know learn some things from him. Yeah, is the way he's he's very good
*  He's an orthodox fighter when he switches southpaw. He's deadly. He's just as good just not bad
*  Yeah, yeah, he can do anything and he's like a computer
*  He starts seeing where those openings find your weaknesses and then starts putting it on you and putting it on you
*  Yeah, Terrence is special. He's got a dog in him, too. Yes. Oh, yeah
*  Loves it he loves it. That's the thing that a lot of people might not take away, but when he turns on that dog
*  You're in trouble. Yeah. No, he's special. I could do it. I think he could too
*  I just don't know if he's famous enough to entice, you know, like not making not making Floyd and Connor, right?
*  Right. I mean who knows I mean maybe Connor wants to have a bunch of it
*  Maybe look Connor's got probably a hundred million dollars in the bank, right?
*  He's doing if he's doing it right now, he's barely doing it for the money anyway
*  He's doing it for the challenge and for the rise
*  Yeah, it might be something that he would be interested in but he just said he wants a Billy
*  Well enough could get there
*  I mean they posted his earnings the other day on one of the pay-per-views that we just did and they were saying these already
*  Made more than 200 million dollars in his career. Yeah. Oh, that's that's a fifth of a way. Yeah
*  No, I yeah, he I definitely think he can do it a bill a bill I mean I'm shooting for two to fifty
*  250 million. Yes, to me. I think to not retire. I'm gonna do other jobs as well, but 250 million
*  I think because at that point it's generational wealth. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, it's something that you know, my kids kids and my family is going to be able to live off of that's dynasty money
*  Yeah, that's that's that's all I care about when you say you do other things like what do you think you'll do when you stop?
*  Fighting I'm still passionate about I want to be a marriage counselor a marriage counselor
*  That was if I wouldn't fight now is what I'd be that is hilarious
*  Do you know how funny that is? Yeah, me and my wife would see a marriage cancer. Yeah, come on
*  Yeah, I see sideline he's got a side gig he's a marriage counselor, yeah, I want to be a marriage council
*  It's just something about it. I
*  Was always I think personally I was always very good at being able to step back from situations and
*  What's going on?
*  keep a level head and being able to dissect what's going on and give advice and give advice and
*  and and I do this with my friends where my friends tell you like think of your boy tell you a story like
*  Man my this happened with my daughter's mom my mom my wife or this and that you know
*  She she came home and she said this and that and all this and then she kicked me out of the house, man
*  She's wrong for this
*  But when they're telling the story in my head, I don't know why but in my head how I'm taking it in is
*  He's saying oh she called me a bitch. What did you say before that?
*  That's that's who that's I naturally that goes into my head. What did you say before that?
*  Then she threw this at me. Why did she throw that? What did you do?
*  What did you say?
*  You know so when everyone tells you a story when they say there's three sides to every story
*  There's yours hers, and I literally like in my mind
*  That's what goes on when someone's telling me a story, but do you know how funny it is that you want to be a marriage counselor?
*  Do you understand how crazy that sounds yeah, it does sound weird, but you're the UFC welterweight champion of the world
*  You got smash people and like I think I'll be a marriage counselor
*  Okay
*  Do you think tomorrow's mom wants to be a longshoreman
*  You want to be a brain surgeon? You want to be a fighter pilot?
*  Marriage counselors number 100. I'm like that's definitely not real. He definitely doesn't want to be a marriage counselor. That's not real
*  Yeah, that that marriage counselor would be there or just um a counselor of some sort a counselor
*  Yeah helping helping shape and mold
*  Well, I want to leave this when I leave this world
*  I want to leave it better than that when I came in or when I lived through it
*  I want to leave it better situation
*  Well one thing you can do you have you could have a tremendous impact on young people
*  Because of what you've accomplished where you've come from how inspirational you are and then just the physical difficulties
*  You're dealing with while you're doing that with your injuries and all the the preparation that you have to do to fight for the title
*  And your honesty about it when people or a young person hears your story like that. It'll make them think like with hard work
*  Anything is possible with the right mindset and the right discipline almost anything is possible. Yes, absolutely
*  anything is possible because um
*  You know where everybody thinks nowadays? Oh, I'm limited. I can't do that because it is I can't do it
*  And it's funny because my daughter sometimes you know will be
*  She's when we're tying her you know her shoes when we're there was a certain point over
*  I'm teaching her to tie her shoes and she gets a point where she can do it. She's doing it
*  She's doing it and then she'll just decide one day that she doesn't want to do it. So she'll play this game like I
*  Can't daddy I can't do it. I'm like why why can't you do it? She's like because
*  I'm I'm for I can't do it because I'm only four so I don't know how to do it
*  I'm like, but you did it yesterday, right? You you can do it. No, I can't do it
*  I don't know how to do it and
*  Like she mentally she just wants to feel that she can't do it because everyone's like oh, you're four years old
*  She knows she's four years old. So she wants to just I'm four so I shouldn't be able to do it
*  I don't want to do it and I'm like no you can do anything that you want to do
*  Or she'll be outside playing soccer cuz I got her into soccer
*  And she's like no, I can't I'm not good. I can't play. I can't know how to do it. Yeah, you can do it
*  No, but I don't I didn't get the ball today. I don't know how to play
*  I'm like you can do anything you want to do if you put your mind to it, baby
*  You can do anything and it's it's sound and when I even when I say that to her, I'm like she's only five
*  But if I say it enough by the time she's 10, it's gonna stick in her mind. It's there
*  And so the fact that people live go through life like that now all I can't do it because I'm nothing I can't do it
*  I'm not supposed to do it. I'm not doing people just feel like no, I shouldn't be able to do it
*  But it's the matter of putting the work in
*  Like you can't tell somebody like if they do something well enough
*  Over and over and over and over and over and over they're not gonna improve
*  Mmm, even though you suck you're gonna get good at sucking
*  At some point like you're gonna improve and so people just don't want to try sometimes because they just like I can't do it
*  I can't be good enough at that. So I won't do it
*  And I and I learned that lesson the hard way because when I started wrestling I used to see there was this
*  There's this poster that a sick put out USA wrestling
*  They put out this poster of the best wrestlers in the country in high school
*  And I remember the first time I went to Fargo. I was looking at the poster and he's just
*  Nerdy looking kids. I mean this one. There's just one kid. He was super nerdy. He had glasses like just like
*  I'm like, you know the kind of kid that you would like I know kids picked on at my school and
*  Then I I hear the name. I see the name. I read the name and I hear it. I'm like, okay
*  I don't know who that is because he's from like some other state
*  maybe like Pennsylvania or something and
*  And then I could hear through the loudspeaker they call they're like all this kids wrestling on map one
*  So then I look at map one and yeah, he looks goofy goofy looking kid
*  See he walk up to the mat takes his glasses off puts him down goes out there and just
*  Whips the shit out of these other kids like I mean he was rolling kids up
*  I'm like
*  What
*  What just happened the rolling kids up and I think if he can do it and and and
*  You know, that's the kind of kid that you would look at and judge my oh man. I can bully this kid
*  I'd be a bad day for a bully. Well, how about chase?
*  You know chase Hoover the 20 year old kid is fighting the UFC. Oh, yeah. Yeah the one that that with the curly hair
*  Yeah, he says I'm gonna go get M&Ms afterwards
*  Didn't he who did he come he went up to Mosfet all and said you beat up my dad
*  I'm just fucking around
*  He's hilarious that kid funny my wife saw him she goes he looks like he goes to Calabasas
*  Hi, yeah, like looks like a like a kid with a backpack. Yeah, like hey, how's everybody doing?
*  I just gotta play video games. They'll fuck you up. It will fuck you up. He's a
*  Nasty grappler to ya. This is very legit. Yeah
*  And he can take it to man like he got cracked in that fight and he just rolls with shit and just he's all
*  Jiu-jitsu like his most of the jiu-jitsu and ground and pound. Yeah fucking 20 years old and he's so cute
*  He's cute. It's a like video chase a cute
*  Oh my god
*  Got that teenage chest to you know, the muscles aren't really in yet
*  I remember having that chest where I'd be in the mirror like trying to make my boobs move like
*  It's tough he's a savvy I like I like his approach
*  He's a good fighter too, man. He's a really good fighter
*  I mean guys like these are the future of the sport and afterwards he's like talking about oh, I'm gonna go get some candy
*  I think I saw a clip Dana White
*  But he was saying he's gonna go get candy I was like
*  Okay, he's gonna get M&Ms or something. My daughter just told me the other day. It's like daddy
*  Do you know there's an M&M store in New York?
*  I was like what?
*  You can get M&Ms anywhere we don't have to go to fucking New York
*  But I guess there's like these stores these like the M&M store like they actually have a store store
*  To where they had like all the products M&M products where there's flask, it's clothes, it's stuff. Is that necessary?
*  It feels like M&Ms are readily available
*  They had a Diet Coke store do we just need a store? There has to be a Coke store isn't there?
*  There is
*  There's gotta be a Coke store, but M&M store that sounds so crazy. Yeah, it's a big thing. I think big big
*  Okay, I mean, I'm a fan of M&M. I like the peanut ones
*  I used to like them and peanut ones are the shit if I'm in a hotel and they got a snack bar and it's peanut
*  Oh, yeah, you know what? I I had a little thing with those in college. Yes
*  Love peanut M&Ms. Yeah, I used to there was a
*  They were the little fun-sized one they'd be in the little vending machine when I was in college I
*  I did the I was the
*  the laundry guy
*  For the athletic the sports athletic team. So that was my work
*  I had a work-study job and so yes all American wrestler
*  But then you know, I did the laundry for all the athletes a lot of them didn't know
*  But I would you know do you know go practice go to school whatnot and then go home and then after all the sports
*  Were done at night. I would come back into the school to go do all the athletes laundry and
*  Hang them up for them to have tomorrow before they all go to practice football basketball
*  You know soccer all the sports and so they were these M&M things
*  So that was like my treat that was like my little I like a lose like a little snack thing that I would
*  Have even when I was cutting weight that was my little
*  It had like maybe six little peanut M&Ms in there
*  But then I got a little addicted to I like them because they could pretend you're eating some good because there's protein in them
*  It's the only candy that you can have that actually gives you protein. It makes yourself feel good. Are you like?
*  Yeah, this protein in here. It's healthy, but it is like how much protein you think is in a bag of peanut M&Ms
*  gotta be a few grams a
*  Bag like a good side one of the nice bags the big bag good bag
*  Cuz I'll eat I'll fuck up a big bag of peanut M&Ms
*  How much it's gotta be let's say a large bag not two three grams
*  Really? I don't know like no
*  Cuz that the whole bag is a serving size
*  One package contains two grams of dietary fiber five grams of protein
*  Oh, whoa
*  Peanut M&Ms cuz they're rich in protein and fiber can actually help you stave off hunger cravings by leaving you feeling fuller longer
*  Did you know that sounds like an ad?
*  Yeah
*  Superior nut store comm that sounds like the wrong name for something
*  Rizzo from Wu-Tang clan was here. Yo Rizzo is a vegan and I had this
*  F-bomb is nut butter. Yeah, and it was there and he's like nut butter. He's like they need a better fucking name
*  Let's go don't over there. So there's a lot of products out there now that are just like putting it out there
*  Yeah, not there's that uh, what is it? Um,
*  Mmm, is it manscape or something like that? Yeah, and they make something they make a call ball wash
*  I'm like, there's a just a ball. Yeah, no subtlety in it at all
*  Yeah, these is for your balls
*  Wash your balls, that's what it is. Wash your balls ball wash. Yeah, we don't need to beat around the bush here literally
*  Yeah, so they just I mean they just put it out there. Yeah
*  Superior nut store in the house, but five grams of protein is legitimate like candy
*  That's like an actual amount of protein
*  Yeah chocolate chocolate supposed to be if it was dark chocolate
*  Someone needs to make like a real good chocolate one like with a good solid dark chocolate like a cow
*  Yeah, you know, so you actually get the antioxidants from the dark chocolate
*  So this the regular the chocolate that's been sold the store. That's not the good chocolate
*  It's not it's not the worst thing for you. Like if I've all the candy I bet chocolate is I mean if it really it just
*  Does chocolate always have cacao in it? I don't know does it do you know?
*  Like could it be both like that feel like that's the definition of it but
*  Right, but like that really don't my favorite my favorite cheat dessert is dark chocolate and peanut butter
*  Just just you know, cuz I remember I like Reese's peanut butter cups
*  But I remember like you got your peanut in my chocolate. You got your chocolate in my peanut butter. It's delicious
*  Remember that yeah, and I was like, well, why why fuck around?
*  Why don't just get a bowl of fucking peanut butter and an actual good chocolate bar and mix those two together
*  It's fucking way better than a Reese's peanut butter cup. Really? Oh, man
*  Yeah, like good like good organic peanut butter and like a real good dark chocolate
*  It's fucking delicious and you don't feel that guilty. Yeah, cuz you're getting like real peanut butter and like real good dark chocolate
*  It's kind of good for you
*  Well, I mean you could kind of be a you know the testament of that because you're like weirdly like in shape
*  Weirdly like in shape like no one really like people talk about like people make up these fantasy matches
*  Joe Rogan versus this guy
*  I'm not fighting anybody. But the thing is you don't look 50. So you're like one of those
*  weirdly organic like in shape guy
*  Well, I'm scared. I'm gonna kick someone's ass
*  I just keep it keep it going because one day the wheels are gonna fall off like right now
*  I could do pretty much everything. Yeah, but I mean one day like sometimes I'll work out
*  I'll hit the bag. I'm like this amazing. I can still do this. Yeah, cuz one day, you know
*  I'm gonna be throwing a kick and I'm gonna be like, ah
*  It's just a matter of time like my my back is just definitely it's a lot. There's a lot fucked up in there
*  There's a lot of discs are shrinking my discs are getting compressed and you know, like I do all these
*  These stretches on these different like there's a reverse hyper machine
*  Decompresses your discs, but that's the one thing is you get older particularly if you've done wrestling or jujitsu
*  Your your discs get squished and so many guys have to get their discs fused. Yeah DC
*  Remember DC threw out his back. Yeah before he threw the day of the fight
*  I think when he fought Derek Lewis, really I think he I remember
*  The day of that fight in the morning. It was like a Saturday morning
*  I'm getting ready to head out and go to practice and I get a call and it's from DC
*  What's the champ call you got fights we call me for so I I pick up the phone my yo, what's up champ and he's like
*  yo
*  you got Heather's number I
*  was like what Heather's the
*  the
*  Physical therapist for the UFC the head physical therapist and I'm like, yeah, I got her number. Well, you good
*  He's like I just woke up I sneezed and I threw out my back
*  And I remember a champion of the world I
*  Sneeze and threw out his back and I remember laughing at him. I'm like, yeah, cuz I thought he was joking
*  He's like, yeah, man. I don't think I'm I gotta fight this fight
*  I'm like, whoa, he's serious. And so, you know Heather works on me
*  He go of course he goes out there and puts on like amazing performance and winning that fight
*  But before this last fight
*  I woke up I've got my bags and stuff and in the morning
*  I'm getting ready getting the car and I sneeze and
*  I hear a little pop in my back. No
*  My back is out. I'm like, no
*  I'm barely turn. I'm like what just I'm like almost crying and first thing I go to I'm like, I'm 32
*  I'm 32
*  What is going on 32 I just sneeze and my back is out and I call my strength and conditioning coach
*  I'm like, yo Cory, I don't know if I'll be able to I'll bro. I just sneeze and I threw out my back, bro
*  And he's like what I was like, yeah, just sneezing. I threw out my back man
*  I cuz you at that point is like one thing after the other and this my hand was hurt
*  You know not too long before that
*  And he's just like come in, you know
*  We'll do some stretches and you know
*  I'll stretch you do some certain things and then we'll try to loosen it up and it was bad for like three or four days
*  Like really bad Jesus Christ really bad to where I'm just like
*  What is happening with the body
*  Like this, what do you do when that happens? Do you ice it?
*  It was you know, cuz I got a train that's the thing was me. It's like I have to train right and so
*  Put heat on it because heat loosens everything up so you can go out and actually somewhat move it around it in train
*  So I just I just tried to stretch try to kind of you know
*  Do certain that I could do because I could barely get in the car at this point
*  It's so crazy that sometimes things like that will happen
*  I grew one of the worst times I ever hurt my neck was in the shower just turned to grab something like shampoo
*  Back when I had hair I turned for shampoo and something went pop and like ah
*  Didn't make any sense
*  And and I had a drive to Vegas me and my friends would see some kickboxing event in Vegas and I'm driving
*  I literally couldn't do this to park. Yeah, if I was gonna turn around
*  I had to turn around like my whole body had to turn around like my neck was not moving
*  Yeah from just turning just turning crazy. How does like just like that? Yeah pop
*  For no reason and now I see a car because I got some you know
*  Who is it that aero spent you know the boxer? Oh, yeah, so I was I was training at their gym
*  when I was in town because I work with his coach sometimes and and I'm like, um, I forgot what they were saying he
*  Was like back was tight one day or something like that. I was like you got a good chiropractor here that you see
*  You know, he's like no, I don't do that stuff
*  What you mean? He's like, yeah my my I don't know whether it is his dad has said something to him early
*  Honor he he's just he's like I don't believe in that
*  I think they they make you worse off there for you went in and and I just been seeing chiropractors
*  For that I'm like damn is he right? Do you know how chiropractors were invented? No, you ready for this?
*  chiropractors were invented in the
*  1800s by a magnetic healer during a seance
*  He apparently came up with this idea that you could fix all the ailments of the body by manipulating the spine
*  He was murdered by his son
*  His son ran him over with a car
*  His son was a con man and his son took over the business and his son started promoting that chiropractic
*  Healing could fix all these problems literally the whole art of chiropractic
*  manipulation and I'm not denying that some people do get pain relief from
*  chiropractors and most chiropractors today really act as more as physical therapists
*  they do a lot of deep tissue work a lot of other things, but the origin of
*  Chiropractic medicine came from a fucking bullshit artist a straight-up bullshit, but it happened in the 1800s
*  So it just got grandfathered in where people took it seriously
*  But there's a crazy article by a woman who was a guest on my podcast in the past
*  How do you say her name you vet to the chiropractors or bullshit? How do you say her her last name?
*  Is it complicated last name?
*  But I didn't know I had no idea because I had gone to a chiropractor once I had a
*  Bulging disc in my neck. Yeah, jujitsu and I was like this just is not getting any better and he's like
*  Oh, you got a muscle pull like I'm just gonna manipulate you everything will be fine
*  I went to him for like a year and it never got any better and then finally went to a real doctor
*  He's like hey, you got a fucking bulging disc man. This is my hands were going numb
*  I was like, why is my hands going numb and he's like, yeah, your disc is pushing out
*  It's pressing and then I did Regenekeen and it fixed it. How do you say her name?
*  Yvette de entremont
*  She's very cool. She was on the podcast. She was pretty hilarious
*  But this the the article is actually pretty hilarious, but it's basically about like how chiropractic
*  Medicine got started out. Yeah, and they call themselves doctors, right? Yeah, they don't go to medical school
*  They're not well, they have the MD don't they no no no. No, I know right you're like, wait a minute
*  What are you talking about? No, they get a doctor in chiropractic doctor like I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor
*  No, it's no PhD. No, it's no PhD. No, no, no. No, they go to chiropractic school
*  Yeah, do you know what percentage of people get accepted to chiropractic school?
*  Tell you yes
*  Ten percent a hundred
*  You know, I will attest to the I work with some
*  Some some good ones some good guys. Oh, yeah to where they can help you they get me right
*  Yeah, you know like I work with this guy dr. Menge and also dr. Davidson and they they do a good job
*  Really kind of cuz I'll go in my neck will be tight in it pop pop pop here in there
*  I was like, I just feel a little bit of relief
*  I feel a little bit a little bit of psychological too. I think but you know
*  Yeah, that's the thing too. Yeah the massage but I said thing for me too is like I'm very aware of the whole placebo effect
*  Of certain things like cuz I'm I was a skeptic. I'm a skeptic sometimes and so going in and actually feeling relief
*  There's a dr. Menge that he works with a lot of a lot of football players as well
*  And he's like you said, you know those guys yeah that he adjusts you and gets you right
*  But he does a lot of physical therapy work as well. That's what more they are now
*  Yeah, and he really kind of helps, you know
*  Some of those elements that I have and he's helped me for a few camps as well as dr
*  Davidson these guys have helped me a lot in my fight
*  So, you know, that's what I and that's the thing too is like when arrows like no, I'm gonna see I don't see them
*  I'm like
*  You know, he's kind of right. Yeah, I know but I'm speaking off of my experiences cuz these guys not just crack crack and pop me back
*  They're actually, you know physically help work some things out to where I'm good to go
*  I just thought they were doctors. I did too. I thought you had to go to medical school to be called the doctor
*  You don't
*  Speaking of Errol Spence, how the fuck did that guy get out of that car crash without a scratch?
*  I mean, what do you like chip a tooth man?
*  That is the crazy you watch that video you like he's dead
*  One of the best boxers in the world is dead and then nothing and if he was wearing a seat belt
*  They said I think he would have died. Yeah, I think he would have died
*  I think yeah, you know, and I don't know maybe he was asleep
*  When he was thrown out of the car because you know, you don't really feel much when you're asleep, you know
*  Yeah, especially yeah, if you if you're asleep your body just is there you're relaxing
*  But you know God just got got him
*  Somebodies watching over him because that's how his time to go
*  I mean there was a video of him getting interviewed a couple months after after the car accident
*  He's out of fight and they're interviewing him and it doesn't look like anything's wrong
*  Said he was like a bruiser scratch somewhere scratches and bruises like watch play that video
*  Can you find that video the video is fucking crazy? I watched it about ten times
*  Hey, and he said not his 488 a Ferrari so he's he must have been cooking
*  I mean he that is a crazy fast car
*  Those four eighty eights are ridiculous have that car and go to speak and especially with the convertible man
*  Man, you know, so, you know God's really watched someone's watched someone's somebody's watching over. Yeah, I want to see this because
*  You find it?
*  No, it's is that it. Yeah, here it is. Look at that. Damn
*  Boom and he goes he went flying out of it right there. That is crazy
*  How the fuck is he okay, I
*  Mean if he was in that car strapped in he would probably be fucked up paralyzed or dead
*  or brain damaged
*  Meanwhile, you just sad part how many boxers have gone through a similar situation, you know, how many box like what's uh,
*  What's his name? Is it Paul Paul Williams?
*  Motorcycle crash. Yeah
*  Things like that fighters like and then and who was that? My buddy Daniel Strauss. Mm-hmm
*  You know Daniel's back. There's a fast fought
*  Yeah
*  since then
*  you know
*  Imagine like something like that and because I watched Daniel kind of slowly because I would try to check up on him
*  You know because I like that guy really liked him. He was training with us at the time
*  Watching him slowly work back because he didn't have any
*  Feeling here at one point and then slowly have to build it back up to the to the you know
*  I don't know. I think it's a fighter and then fight and win. Yeah, he came in here with Joe Schilling
*  It's like while he was on his way up one of those way back rather how about and did member Diego Corrales?
*  They are Corrales died from motorcycle accident as well
*  There's it's been a lot of fatalities like that. Like can you imagine how sad this story would have been?
*  I mean, I mean with aerospace. Oh my god, that's a guy that's loved and man loved not just in Dallas
*  But all over the world after he beat Mike Garcia, everybody's like, holy shit. Is this guy for real?
*  I mean, I knew he was for real. Well, but really for he's Mikey Garcia is a very good fighter. He shot him down
*  Yes, I mean he couldn't do anything to him
*  He's he's one of those special guys. Yes special fighter special boxer. You got to get him up here
*  I would love to I would love to well
*  Terrence could be a big fight in the future and they were thinking about him and Terrence Crawford before the accident
*  Yeah, you know, I would love to have him in he's an interesting dude. He's sponsored by on it too. Really? Yeah. Yeah
*  Dallas right Austin Austin. Yeah. No, he's there's there's a great group of like super talented boxers
*  Now like this is a an amazing time. Yeah, and the thing about him too that I like is that he's this
*  He's been the same guy
*  Now that he that he was when he was an amateur because I met him while he was an amateur
*  oh, I was living at the Olympic Training Center and I was dating a boxer at the time and
*  You know all the boxers when they have national team practices
*  They would come through before that Olympic cycle and they would all come through and do two three words
*  Or maybe a month training camp all up there at the training center
*  so I got to kind of meet these boxers and and you know talk to and get you know acquainted with some of them like
*  Was it Marcus Brown who was a world champion?
*  Rashi Warren Jamil Heron
*  I got to kind of see these guys and that's when I finally I first recognized them and
*  Then watching them all make to switch to the pros and get to where they're at now
*  Eros Benz has been that same guy the whole time which is one thing that I love because you know
*  I feel like that's kind of how I am in my sport
*  I don't have to you know turn on this charm just because it works for Connor
*  It works for this guy for him them to be just brash and out there
*  Yeah, don't you think that's gonna work that's Connors personality. Yeah, that's Connor. It works for him
*  That's him like Tyson became a superstar and he had none of that in him
*  You know he was he had a totally different way of talking very soft-spoken in a lot of ways, you know
*  but the Tyson the fighter the result and the Tyson that the just the Tyson in general is
*  Well, I would say Mike and I would say Tyson are two different people. Yeah, and then knowing him now, man. It's like
*  That guy was that guy. Mm-hmm. It's I mean he's amazing man
*  I've been pretty jazzed up talking a lot of people on the podcast
*  But I've never felt weirder than talking to him. You're always gonna feel that way. I
*  Still feel that way. I still feel it's like
*  There's a lion sitting next to you
*  The whole time
*  like we just spent New Year's in New York and
*  And he's it's me it's him and it's Henry it's a hoodo and we're talking and just and we're just getting knowledge from him
*  the whole time
*  There's a lion
*  You can't shake that feeling I know and shake it
*  You never will right? You just you never will it's just what makes a guy like that special
*  You know, it's like if Muhammad Ali was in a room which you know, I never got to ever experience or see but if Muhammad Ali
*  Was no, I'm sure guys it just didn't matter and Dana said this at one point
*  You could have Michael Jordan the best, you know or the best baseball player and
*  You have the best football player and you have the best musicians in the world all these guys in a room
*  But when Mike Tyson walks in the room everybody knows Mike Tyson is in a room
*  Yeah, it's just something different about a fighter
*  Like that. Yeah, they walk in a room. Everyone is on alert. Oh shit. There's a lion in the room
*  It's the pinnacle of sports is the elite fighter
*  Yeah
*  It's the pinnacle of sports and especially the elite heavyweight champion and especially a guy like Tyson who you know in his prime was just
*  He changed everything he changed
*  like I said
*  the the the vision was so lackluster before he rose to prominence and when when he did I mean I remember when he was
*  On the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine
*  He was 19 years old and they had the cover it said kid dynamite and it was him and he looked so young and
*  That's how I found out about him
*  I remember I saw maybe I've seen some clips or something like that of him sending some guy flying with a left hook
*  But then watching, you know seeing the the cover of that magazine
*  I was like this guy's 19 years old like that is crazy. They're talking about being the next heavyweight champion
*  Yeah, I mean and you know even now
*  Like knowing all of that and seeing all of that because I you know, you kind of try to bring it
*  I'm like man and talk to him now
*  It's like
*  He's just like
*  That was such a long time. I love his beard too. It makes him look scholarly
*  I know
*  He's a wise old master. Yeah, and it kind of gives him a it gives him a little
*  It's kind of like a little cover. You think it's like he hides him a little bit
*  Yeah, but we were here we had lunch in New York in New York and then we walk out this little like
*  place in New York and
*  we come out we're on the street and
*  somehow a bus full of like
*  Tourists I kind of know if they were the Asian tourists like a bus some were somewhere from Asia like there
*  Just pulls up right in front of us
*  We're like right there and they all get out and initially because he's wearing a beanie and he's wearing a big jacket
*  you know, we're kind of standing outside and
*  they're doing some recreational stuff and so and so we're just kind of standing there initially and
*  You know one guy walks up one guy like while he's walking by and kind of just looks back
*  And you could see it cuz you know that look you you know, right?
*  Like you know like when you're somewhere and people are trying to figure out if it's you right you see him kind of do the
*  Double-take and they're thinking in their mind in there
*  Is that who I think it is?
*  And then he gets like halfway down the street and at this point I peep him
*  I'm seeing him and he turns around and he walks back
*  like Mike
*  Mike is that you and like is freaking
*  He's like, please please give me can I get a picture please please and and of course Mike is I so such a nice guys
*  I use a sweetheart and Mike takes a picture one
*  Then one of the Taurus sees him
*  Now it's a swarm
*  It's a war
*  Thankfully his wife is just pulling up in the car and and Mike hops in but I'm like
*  Mike hasn't fought in how long I when his last fight was what?
*  15 years ago and
*  That's how the reception he stood. Yes, like people still freak out that it's in Mike Tyson
*  It was incredible for me to see that it's like at some point
*  That's what we want to get to that's that's the level of respect and the level that as a fighter
*  That you always that you want to get it's so interesting that now he's in the weed business
*  Yeah, I mean and he smokes weed all day long. He's one of the and he's like it makes me nicer
*  It's like calms me down keeps me sane. Yeah, I mean it works, you know, sir certain guys, you know
*  It depends on some guys some guys abuse it but certain guys use it as a medicine
*  But it's also like who doesn't want to get high with Mike Tyson, you know
*  But I was on the podcast I'm like Henry you want to pass me one of those was Henry hit net. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah. Yeah, so you don't get high at all. No, no never I have I have yeah, I
*  For my my 26th birthday was the first time I tried it what happened
*  Nothing, nothing. Nothing. I mean, I guess I didn't know how to do I didn't know how to inhale it
*  I didn't know how to smoke it and you know, I'm like this does nothing
*  I hit it like maybe two three times like does nothing didn't feel the thing and then that same year
*  I had to I think was 26. Yeah, I was thinking was the last year I was at the
*  Training center the Olympic training center and and I had to do I did the ultimate fighter season 14
*  I was a wrestling coach for team mayhem Miller and
*  and
*  me and mayhem would sit cuz we were in the same house and we'd
*  Would sit on the balcony at night after filming all day when come and he would uh, he would smoke and we just relaxed and he
*  Decompress and that was a crazy thing about mayhem to smart guy. I mean, yeah, he had a crazy path
*  But it smart guy who just come back and sit there and relax and just think and he would say certain things
*  And then he was like, yo, you should try this you should try this. I'm like, nah, that doesn't do nothing for me, man
*  I already tried it this weed does nothing for he's like you doing it wrong
*  No, like no it doesn't do anything for me man, and then he's like
*  Try this edible and it's a it's an edible is a peanut brittle. Oh Jesus like a just like a fat piece
*  I'm like bro. This don't weed doesn't do it doesn't affect me, bro
*  and this is doing for me and uh, I
*  Had the edible had a big piece to him eating because it was like it was good. It was chocolate was candy
*  Just eat them eat them like this is nothing and
*  Maybe like six seven minutes later. I'm like I need to go get water
*  so I opened on my let me go get some water inside and
*  You walk in the balcony the sliding door you walk inside my room is our rooms are this way down the hall
*  His rooms further my rooms just to the right and the kitchens right in front so I walk in I'm like, okay
*  Get some water
*  I'm like three steps before I get to the counter, but I'm just like there
*  What's going on I
*  Never touch the water. I eventually just somehow turn up to my right
*  Just stumble into my room. I
*  fell on my bed like this I
*  Woke up 10 hours later
*  Just like that didn't move best rest I ever got Wow, I was like
*  No, did you have crazy dreams no, I
*  You just went out but it was it was a fun. Yeah, it was a fun time
*  It was it was because I was like the first time I've experienced Vegas
*  so that we were shooting the show in Vegas and so that was my first time being in Vegas and uh,
*  But it was fun time and I was just like wow, okay
*  But then I after that I smoked again with my friends out in Florida like years ago, maybe four years ago
*  And that was when I actually got high from smoking
*  You know, I hit it hard at first. I'm like cuz I'm the same. I'm like this doesn't affect me guys
*  You know cuz I was like the reason it hit me is cuz it was edible. I'm never doing edibles again
*  Okay, never again. So I already wrote that out. My weed doesn't affect me guys. So I hit it hard
*  Hold it you got hold it in I'm holding it. Yeah, I'm start coughing. I call for like maybe six minutes
*  Oh, no hard coughing almost
*  So I'm like, bro, this is nothing I hit it again
*  Like right away pass me that I hit it again hard
*  coughing
*  This is not gonna do nothing for it. I hit it again hard
*  coughing
*  Bro, I told you guys this does nothing for me man, and we're sitting on the couch and
*  And
*  My little brother calls me and
*  He was I think this was when he was making the transition. He was leaving football
*  He calls me he's talking to me on the phone and we're talking I'm like man. Everything's good, man
*  You'll you'll be fine. We'll do something else and boom. I
*  Forget everything I was just talking about I
*  was a
*  I'll call you back. So I hang up and I immediately I'm one of those guys if I don't have control around
*  I feel like I don't have control of my body my thoughts was going on
*  I kind of have anxiety so I kind of start going to the panic mode
*  And so I'm sitting there on the couch and these guys are looking at me and I look left to these guys. I'm like
*  Guys something's that something's wrong. Something's wrong. Something is wrong
*  Something's wrong. I don't know what's going on
*  I was just trying to talk to my brother and I forgot everything I was talking about something's wrong and they're laughing
*  Hysterically, they're laughing at me bad
*  And I'm and then now I'm like, okay. No, I gotta be cool. I gotta try to be cool
*  I gotta control this I'd be cool. I'd be cool
*  But the biggest thing is I couldn't control what was going on
*  The fact that I was feeling what I was feeling I couldn't shut it off
*  That was it for me. I was like, yeah, I can't that's too much though. Yes. Well, like that's not what you're supposed to do
*  I
*  Did it wrong
*  There's also a thing that happens when you cough like I don't know why it gets it deeper in your lungs
*  I don't know if there's science behind that. Is there any science behind that?
*  Is that real like coughing gets you more high because it is for me when I when if I'm smoking pot and I cough I go
*  Oh, no
*  They say they say well from what I've heard they say oh it makes it worse when you cough and it gets deeper into your lung
*  I've heard that a bunch of times. I've heard that a bunch of times
*  I don't know if it's I don't know if that's real though, or maybe just really high and that's why you're coughing
*  Yeah, you know, I'm not sure maybe it's a smoke because I'm not used to having smoke in my lungs
*  Yeah, because even now if I walk through casinos, I'm sick for a while with pot
*  You just want to if you're not if you're a rookie if you're not a veteran, you don't do it a lot
*  You want this? Sorry ready?
*  That's it stop stop right there wait give yourself some time which reminds me um
*  I
*  Smoked again
*  After that, oh, I think a couple years ago, but I it was like almost like
*  Pier pressure he didn't pressure me but it was like
*  Rashad
*  He didn't appear pressure me but it was like I'm with Rashad
*  That's my brother if he's doing it, I gotta try it, you know
*  So he's like he knows how to do it like for him. It's like medicinal like now it's right
*  He so I
*  We were at a court going to a comedy show
*  country Wayne is the
*  Comedian comedian and we're going to see him and funny guy. So we're going country way country Wayne
*  Yeah, he's a big following now and on the south and and he does his whole show
*  I don't think he curses at all really that funny guy if you look him up very funny guy and
*  So
*  We're at the show and before the show starts and he's like, let's take a walk
*  So we're walking and in over shot. It's like me and him like the wisdom that he passes on to me. It's crazy
*  I love being around him. I love spending time with him
*  And so we're walking and you know, and then he's whips it out and he's smoking
*  I'm like sure I've always heard like you keep people things get funnier when you smoke weed
*  I
*  Like oh man, it's gonna be the best comedy show ever cuz this guy's already funny
*  I think it's funny and this is gonna make it funnier. Oh my gosh a good idea
*  So I take it on but I'm like I learned from last time. I'm not gonna hit it like that
*  Just light hit. Mm-hmm, you know once maybe twice, but that's it. So I hit it boom. I
*  Cough a little bit but not as bad, you know cough just a little bit
*  And I'm okay and so we're still walking and then I hit it again light, you know this time I didn't cough
*  I'm like, hi, that should be good. I should be perfect. This shows gonna be phenomenal
*  So we get in now
*  We're sitting in and we're sitting in because you know those improv comedy clubs are very very tight, you know
*  Especially the big nice ones, but the VIP tickets you're right there on the floor next to them
*  So we're like maybe three seats away from the stage
*  so we're there and it's a packed house, it's everything sold out and
*  We're watching him we're watching him we're watching him and I remember like now I start
*  feeling something
*  I'm getting I'm like paranoid now
*  So I'm I'm talking to Rashad well in my head I think I'm talking to him
*  So I'm thinking I'm trying to whisper because I don't want to interrupt the show cuz I want the comedian
*  Because I've heard comedians would go go after you so I'm like trying not to interrupt the show I'm like I'm thinking I'm like
*  Rashad Rashad
*  But I'm really like
*  And
*  And I'm and I'm one of my why is he not paying attention to me? Why is it Rashad?
*  We're I'm looking at him like Rashad something's wrong
*  I'm trying to signal him. I'm using my eyes. I'm trying to signal him like bro
*  I gotta get out cuz I almost I was this close to running out of
*  that the improv comedy club
*  But then would you where would you have gone? I just run out of there
*  I just in those cases you're better off just sitting still and waiting for it to pass
*  I know but I was I was I was like in my mom's like
*  Exactly what I thought I'm like I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out of here now
*  But then and I was in my mind and I was like no my what stop being a punk
*  Stop being a punk. You can handle this. So I'm like trying to reel myself back in in my mind
*  I'm like just breathe relax breathe relax watch the show breathe and I'm getting to the show
*  I'm getting to it, but every now and again it'll creep back in you're high bro. You're high get out of here get out
*  But that's it that was it for me after that one. I'm like, you know what? We just not for me
*  It's just not not for me I've had those experiences a hundred times
*  At least maybe more probably yeah, like what I'm never doing this again, you know, we just get so high
*  It just gets ridiculous
*  But you still do still do it. I like it. I
*  Always learn something when I get that high when I get real high and something's bothering me
*  I'm probably like well, I probably have an issue. I need to take care of like something's bothering me in the first place
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah like if if I get paranoid about something or I feel bad about something maybe I said or something I did
*  Like marijuana like if you have something that you're you're like maybe pushing in the back your head
*  Yeah marijuana is like hey. Hey, what the fuck is that? What's that? Let's turn a light on click put a flashlight on it
*  It's like it makes you think like Eddie Bravo told me this once it really made a lot of sense
*  He goes the best time to get high is when nothing's fucking with you if nothing's fucking with you and you get high
*  It's like oh you can just enjoy it
*  But if you if you got anything that you're putting off anything that you're half-assing
*  Anything you're doing wrong in your life anything you're procrastinating
*  Anything where you you're not really doing your best not giving it your all if you get high you start thinking like what am I doing?
*  My life, but isn't that like everybody and every time?
*  Like very seldom or is everything okay? That's true, too
*  That's very seldom is everything. Yeah, okay. That's true, too
*  Like I can count on one hand how many times I've just sat back and said
*  Everything is beautiful. Everything is good
*  Yeah, that's true, right? I mean if you're doing difficult shit
*  Especially and clearly you're doing difficult shit if you're doing something difficult with your life
*  Like you're always in a state of some some kind of struggle. Yeah, yeah, it's never
*  It's never like oh man. This is perfect. Man. It's funny wonderful
*  It's such a true thing you just said you know everything at some point something is always gone
*  There's something always going on, but isn't that weird that everybody wants everything to be perfect, and it really never is yeah
*  It never is constant state of that, but you see people like that's what social media is all about right social media
*  Projects this image of perfect yes like you see some guy
*  Leaning on a cool car stand in front of a nice house beautiful girl with him like this fucking guys got it made
*  He doesn't feel any pain or suffering. Yeah, he's just smooth sailing through life
*  Look at him with a six-pack and I blame you I blame this show actually the last time I was here
*  The last time I was here after that it just got worse. Oh they hate I know not just hate but now like
*  People like oh, I need help. I need help with this hey my

*  Imagine if like that's how they make a living they just get a lot of people do that no a lot of people do that
*  Yeah, that's but it's it's that it's that whole deal is like that
*  Everyone puts on social media to smoke screen puts everything out there the best part of them out there speaking of social media
*  I just got you. Did you see that? I just got hacked. Did you really get hacked or did I know I got hacked?
*  Is Ali still your manager?
*  I thought Ali did that no look you got hacked, but if you know, but if you if you know
*  Let's you know the for when I said when the first me in the eye when I you definitely got hacked
*  I would tell you if you got I'll tell you did Ali lie to you
*  No, Ali didn't lie to me because the crazy thing is the crazy thing is were were
*  We were we were preparing to go to the fight
*  we like to they were coming to get us because the fights already started the prelims that started and
*  he was about to start the main card, so we're preparing to go as a Saturday and
*  You know my phone's just bloop bloop and get in text message text message text message
*  I'm gonna say maybe it's just one person you want to get there
*  Because my phone just blows up sometimes so I'm not really looking at my phone. I'm just trying to get out of there and go and
*  Somehow I I just I picked my phone up we're getting walking down to the car
*  I slide it up and I have 26 messages. What the what just happened?
*  so and then the top one was a
*  What's her name page? You know used to work for the UOC is like
*  Are you
*  Looking at your Twitter right now. I was like what what are you talking about is I yeah?
*  This is that what I thought I thought you something's wrong with your Twitter right now
*  You need to get on there, so I like what I get on my phone. I try to go into my Twitter
*  I can't I'm locked out
*  so someone had got in and changed the password in the email, so I can't even get into my Twitter and
*  And then I'm with Ali because he's with me and we're walking down. I'm like yo Ali
*  You know I need to see your phone now
*  I need to see your phone because I can't even see what they were tweeting and
*  So I get his phone and I go to my page and the first couple the first
*  Like the first one was like it was wrong and it on so many levels was kind of funny if you're a troll
*  You know but he was tweeting Connor. He was like I'm gonna be raw dog gonna do something with your wife tonight
*  I was like whoa, that's a little
*  You know that's a little much
*  You know and then the next one another one comes in another one comes in another I'm like now
*  He's going all the way left
*  And now he's at one point even said something about Mike Tyson your n-word like you're effing n-word you're this is it to Mike Tyson
*  Yeah, so he's tweeting to a bunch of people now
*  He's tweeting to a bunch of people like you know you're effing n-word or this and that like like going in like that
*  Oh, and then it's cross screen screen screenshots my bank account somehow. He gets got into my bank account
*  Got into my bank account screenshots it and puts it out now. I'm getting like
*  Messages like yo what is go like and then of course that was right there
*  I'm like old they got my bank account boom. I call the bank
*  I'm on the phone with my bank, and we're in the car going to the arena
*  to to Connors fight and
*  Now Dana we're getting calls from a message from everybody like yo
*  We would now the UFC is working on getting the Twitter shutdown and by the time they called and got the Twitter shut down
*  He had tweeted my bank, you know screenshot of my bank accounts. He you know they tweeted
*  You know the random people a lot of a lot of disrespectful things
*  He was like oh what he was I want one tweet
*  He was like you know if I get over a hundred a thousand followers or a thousand
*  Comments or retweets on this I'm gonna put his peanut pin code out or is like internet password the password for that out there
*  I'm like how?
*  Duff cuz I have my phone right
*  Like how did they get in to my stuff and I have everything
*  Now Instagram they shut down my Instagram right away before he could post anything
*  you know because that I have a lot more followers on there, and it was just like I
*  was so like just
*  just
*  Flustered by it all to where I couldn't do anything but smile like I just does anybody ever post for you
*  Yeah, it used to they used to yeah, but I I'm I still like to have some level of control
*  But but meaning that other people besides you had your password. Yeah, yeah
*  Yeah, but it's it's it's someone that I know someone that I trust you know it's not like random people
*  No, it's one person one person
*  But is it possible that one person left their phone laying around or something and someone saw the password?
*  No, no because no it can't you because it wasn't just my Twitter. They got my bank account right? That's what's crazy
*  I mean, I don't how are they connected?
*  How's the bank account and and from what I'm learning now is they can ease it hackers can easily hack you from an IP
*  Like you're a Starbucks Wi-Fi. They can yeah, that's why yeah you want a
*  Virtual private network of VPN yeah, we use express VPN
*  But there's a bunch of them you you could use that and the good thing about it is also you could get into
*  Accounts like you could do stuff like you know you're in other countries. They lock you out of things
*  Yeah, like you can't look certain parts of the web you can if you have a VPN
*  Yeah, because this was what and obviously something they were using because you know they sign when they sign in to mine
*  They try to get into my my email
*  They got into me when they sign in because now you have that two-factor authenticator or whatever and when they sign in it
*  Show one of them showed that they were in New York another one showed that they were in like, Bali
*  So they were switching up
*  Yeah, yeah, whoever knew what they were they knew what they were doing because they were they were getting in there saying some
*  And it was like and of course and I saw that and and it was unfair to to my manager for people to actually
*  Say that because you know
*  Automatically everybody assume of course everyone say and then Connor said something about it, too
*  Which was just kind of which was very low I understand that the comments that were tweeted out were very very disrespectful
*  First of all that's not me. I don't even talk like of course
*  You know and I would never say anything like that even though as much as I want to beat him up if he Connor
*  Wants to fight we can fight but I would never there's lines that you don't cross. That's not you at all
*  I would never you know, you're saying it you're so like effing you yeah
*  I mean don't get it wrong. I'll say, you know, yeah, yeah, you know, but it was just I would never say anything about someone's family
*  Someone's wife someone or children. I would never say that no
*  I never thought for a second it was you and and Ali is a guy that's so into his friend would never say I don't
*  Care how much he hates Connor or how much he does. I thought he was just trying to stir up the pot
*  No, no, I didn't know the thing is I didn't know the extent of course not
*  I didn't know the extent of what he had said either. I didn't know a bunch of people. It's bad. It was bad
*  It was some of the things can they find out who did it? Is it their way? I would think so, but
*  You know, it's I'm sure that something like that is gonna be expensive
*  Mmm, you know someone's got to investigate that tell the UFC pony up bitch, you know
*  You know, is it is it worth it for them to do it if it is if it's Ali?
*  That's sure that's the only way it's worth it. That's sure if it's just some random crazy dudes a Russian hat
*  Yeah, that's not worth it
*  But that's what that's I'm saying in order to find out if it's worth it now
*  You got to do the investigation you gotta pay for all of that. Yeah, but I
*  You know
*  The funny the funny thing is
*  Soon as we get there Danny comes up and like initially I didn't know what he meant
*  But he was like it's like yeah, I talked I had to talk with him like, you know
*  I made sure everything was okay, and I'm thinking like I had to talk with who what are you talking about?
*  And and this was before I really saw the tweets. He's like, yeah, I had to talk with Connor
*  I'm thinking like I'm giving shit about Connor. I got hacked
*  Talking about right until I saw the comments of what was said towards him. I was like, oh shit
*  Okay, I understand this guy's going into one of the biggest fights
*  I mean he's this is a return fight, you know with everything he's gone through and having that hanging around or someone saying
*  Of course. Yeah, it's just first of all, we're not that thirsty. I'm the champion the belts gonna move
*  I'm gonna fight somebody now, you know, so I don't really care who it is
*  I'm gonna fight somebody has he mentioned he has mentioned your name, right?
*  The only reason we're even talking about Connor Connors even in the conversation because he came out and said
*  Like he wanted my belt. Yeah, like I don't give it. I don't get two shits about Connor
*  Well, the idea would have that 45 tap to 55 tap to 70
*  I don't really care but 70 if he could win a title at 70
*  I mean goddamn for your 55 and 70 that would be arguably would be one of the biggest fights because
*  Because he's trying to make history
*  No one's ever done that to go up three weight classes and get a belt in all three weight classes
*  No one has ever done that. Well the UFC's campaign for Khabib and Khabib's like give me a hundred million bucks. Yeah
*  He's in this position to ask that he's the fucking champ. Yeah, and he doesn't want to fight him
*  He's like fuck that guy. No, I've been there done that
*  Yeah
*  And also is like why am I gonna give this guy more attention and hear him say more crazy shit about me and all that
*  Stuff that he did before
*  Yeah, some people don't care for that no Khabib is very honorable guy he's not in the business of talking shit
*  He doesn't have anything to do with that
*  But he said one of the darkest things I ever heard of a guy say before he said I want to change his face
*  Change his face changes and you see the conviction in his face when he looked at the camera said send me location
*  Send location send me send me send me location. I fucking love that statement to do this new you Brooklyn
*  Yeah, go send me location. Yeah
*  We're like
*  And that's that's how I feel too
*  You know like a lot of these guys do all these talking now and do this and this whole mass with all character do all
*  This talking and and you know I used to I respected mass with all a lot before
*  You know, but you know after years of years of being in the game
*  You finally start to get a little shine and this is how you're gonna do it
*  This is what you know now you're you're that gimmicky guy. Yeah, but now you're talking about him, you know exactly
*  No, I get that I get his management team
*  Even though you know my management is taking care of his management team before you know, that's another story
*  But you know, they've done a good job of getting him to this point where he's got this hype around him now
*  But that's what it is is a little bit of a good job
*  But knocking out Donald Cerrone knocking out Darren till and putting Ben Asker into another dimension with a flying knee
*  All that helped and then fucking up Nate Diaz and open up two vaginas on his face
*  That is that is why he got popular right? You know that yeah
*  But you know like were those the hardest fights at that time?
*  Well Darren till was thought to be a very hard fire until was a good one
*  Yeah, that was the answer was a good one. He was coming off of the Tyrone Woodley fight
*  But still Darren till was thought to be a very good fight. Yes, and Donald Cerrone, you know, Donald is a real 55 pounder
*  Yes, yes
*  But I'm talking about those big fights. Yes
*  So Donald Cerrone Darren till and then the Ben Asker and one that was no matter how you slice it
*  That's goddamn crazy what he did to him. Yeah, absolutely. I mean to land that knee. Yeah, it's crazy
*  Yeah, you know, but what happens if that knee not landed who knows exactly
*  I mean he might just that was a gambling up. That was that that was the gamble
*  Yes, I think that was the gamble fight that paid off and
*  Mm-hmm sent him. Well, he took all that hype from Ben Asker. Yeah, you know, but I understand I get it
*  Rightfully so but you know now to kind of make all this noise and say you're this and now you're gonna do this
*  Like I've heard him gone as far as he's gonna break my face
*  He's gonna do all of this and do that, but then I see you backstage and nothing was said
*  Nothing we sat in the same role in Connors fight the same role maybe ten people apart nothing was said
*  You know, I'm that type of guy if you're good
*  If I say what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do something to you when I see you. I'm that's it's on site
*  I don't that's that's not me. I don't like to talk to shit and this and that but if I feel a certain way about
*  You when I see you I'm gonna confront you about it
*  So your number one pig is GSP number one is GSP number was GSP for legacy for history for everything
*  Number two red panties night Connor, of course, absolutely very close red panties night number two
*  number three
*  Is that yeah, yeah that kid Mazviel. Oh, yes. Why does he call you owl? What is owl hunting? What is that?
*  Out that makes
*  No, because they when people try to bring him up, yeah, like he's just kill him
*  Who come on that's hilarious both on both sides. Yeah, I mean it is what it is that we know
*  Let's just be honest unless they somehow cuz they're doing everything possible not to fight me right now
*  They're begging for a counterfeit. They're begging for that fight because like I get it
*  Let's be honest his if my manager said it too if I was his manager, yes, why would I fight you?
*  You know, I've got all this hype right now. I would do everything possible to fight you
*  Of course, I want to fight Connor you fight Connor and lose guess what?
*  I still got the payday who cares giant one. Yeah, a big giant payday who cares?
*  Yeah, but he fights me he goes back down and make him 50 and 50 or whatever. He was making before I get all that hype is done
*  You know, so yeah, why would I fight you? No, I have the opportunity to potentially fight Connor if Connor picks him
*  It's real interesting right now, right? It's like how does this all play out?
*  We're just waiting for the UFC to pull up but listen everyone is is the problem is everyone has
*  Been saying oh they they need to give him a title shot need to give him a title shot
*  I need to give him a touch. Well, guess what?
*  You just might get what you wish for but now you realize oh, I don't I don't really want the title shot
*  I want no I want I want this money over here. I want this guy to pick me so I can get that money
*  I don't really want the title shot because we both know what's gonna happen him and I both know his management team
*  No, everybody knows what's truly gonna happen
*  But that's the nature of the game because he's got his fans who really believe that he can beat anybody in the world
*  That he can't be touched. They're just like, oh, yeah, that's the guy that's gonna beat you. He's gonna knock you out
*  He's gonna do whatever he wants to do to you
*  No, it's not gonna happen not even remotely possible for it to happen being exciting fight to set up
*  Oh, yeah, I mean, I don't care like I'll fight anybody the height behind it would be
*  gigantic for fight anybody for actually for all three of those fights all three of those fights are here you're in the driver's seat, which is
*  Beautiful, or you really are because everybody wants that title
*  You have the like nobody's the the BMF titles like no one's trying to get that
*  No, it's just it's just a no one cares cool-looking belt that he gets to carry around with them
*  But everybody wants your belt
*  Yeah
*  so, you know at the end of the day that's you know, then it said that's the fight that he wants and
*  And we're in the business of doing business with Dana right now
*  So if that's the fight that Danny wants to make then we're gonna go in and we're gonna talk and what kind of timeline you
*  Think you're looking at like if ideally for you. Well, let's see April's taken already
*  March is taken
*  What about July?
*  I'm ready to fight as soon as possible. April. I'm ready to fight. That's gonna be in Vegas, too
*  I'm ready to fly event. Yeah, I'm ready to fight them. You know, we'll see what Dana says if it makes sense for them
*  That's what I want to see. Oh, yeah, I want to see red pants
*  You and him would be fucking crazy. God damn that would be huge. Yeah, um, you know if it happens it happens
*  But I I'm not hoping you know holding my breath. I'm excited about all three of those matchups
*  They're doing everything they're doing everything they're good around it and you know, it is what it is for them
*  I don't think I'd be extra hyped for any of those fights. I think all three of them. I'm at a hundred
*  Yeah, whether it's GSP. I'm at a hundred Mazda. I'm at a hundred red panties night
*  Come on. I'm fucking pumped. I'm a hundred percent pumped for all three of those. Honestly, I you know at some point
*  We just look at I'm like that actually kind of makes more sense than even you know
*  Obviously the mass with all being in the welterweight it has been doing his thing, you know, but it's like
*  This guy hasn't beat anybody in the top five hasn't fought anyone in the top five
*  Well if Connor jumps right ahead of everybody and gets a title shot like people
*  You know some people some people will frown upon it, but at the same time at the same time they get you know
*  He's fought. He just fought at what to wait
*  Yeah, you know and they'll get it because look Connor did the same thing for lightweight. Mm-hmm
*  He went straight into a fight. You didn't even fight a tune-up fight. He just fought a tune-up fight
*  Yeah at Walter way and lightweight he didn't he just jumped right into the title you saw what he did there
*  Yeah
*  So people are intrigued to see if Connor is really this miss mythical creature that can go in and win three titles
*  Dude, you know like that
*  I mean it makes sense if Connor wants that opportunity get who am I to try to stand in the way of his opportunity to try to
*  To be great. I don't mind red panties night July set it up UFC
*  I
*  Listen champ. It was great having you in there as always appreciate your brother. Thank you so much
