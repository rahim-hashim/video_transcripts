# Joe Rogan Experience #1477 - Tony Hawk
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4kjSXFr-U)
*  And we're rolling. How are you Tony? Awesome, thank you. My pleasure. Thanks for coming
*  here man. Yeah, hey thanks for inviting me. It's an honor. It's interesting to see you
*  even just fuck around with your skateboard just the way you maneuver it. You're so adept.
*  It's really weird like the way you move your feet and just pick it up and... Oh, I mean
*  it really is just at this point kind of an extension of my body. It seems like. And it's,
*  I guess it's weird. I don't think about how comfortable I am and a lot of times we'll
*  be in a city or something or just like now. I didn't know where to park, right? So I just
*  park somewhere kind of close and just I go skate. And I feel way better about doing that
*  than like parking and then walking somewhere. And it just, you know, I know I can get around
*  people and sort of be indiscreet and stealthy. Wait, wait, indiscreet? Tony Hawk on a skateboard
*  is indiscreet? That's ridiculous. That might be the most ridiculous thing. I do get weird
*  things for sure. I get a lot of do a kickflips out from car windows. Oh really? Oh, that's
*  funny. Yeah. That's my curse that I, that I, that's my burden I carry. I'm seeing these
*  new skateboards that are, they look like convertibles where as these guys flip the board, the wheels
*  flip up and go to the other side. Oh yeah, that's a, that's sort of a phenomenon, sort
*  of a social media thing going on. Ah, like so you can see it in slow-mo. Is that what
*  it is? No, where the board is actually a contraption, right? Yeah. I don't, I don't
*  really understand what that is. There's a, there's a select few people doing that. Yeah.
*  And I've seen a couple where they actually have figured out how to make their board grind
*  and then do a flip around a rail as they jump back on it. Oh boy. Yeah. That's, it's very
*  specialized though. I can't say that's a movement. It's just a few key people that are doing
*  it. How many bones do you have to break to perfect that? When I see this dude sliding
*  down rails, I'm like, how many times do you fuck that up and snap a forearm? I, well,
*  skating went through a different, different waves of disciplines basically. And in the
*  early nineties it was all street, right? And so what I did was, was vert skating. That
*  was kind of dying out. So I, I was skating street a lot too. And I realized I was not
*  fit to be a street skater. The third time I rolled my ankle, like both ankles twice.
*  Then the third time the other one, I was like, I don't want to do hand rails anymore. This
*  is not working for me. This impact is I'm not going to be able to skate anymore if I
*  keep doing this. Yeah. I see these kids like when you, whenever you go like near like a
*  large office building that has a lot of outdoor space and you see them using the rails and
*  stuff and like how many breaks can you have before? Like I, there, I think that it's a
*  little deceiving cause people do know how to fall relatively safely from, from stuff
*  like that. But they get addicted, right? They're doing that probably every day. Yeah, for sure.
*  There's all kinds of different styles. So there's tech styles where it's more people are skating
*  ledges and benches and they're flipping their board, grinding, flipping out stuff like that
*  where it's low impact, but super technical. And then there's just the stunt men who are
*  doing the big rails, the big gaps, you know, jumping fences and how did this happen? Like
*  what was like, how did it go from just riding a skateboard? When I was a kid, you and I are
*  the same age, but when I was, I guess I was probably like 11 or 12, I had a skateboard.
*  I was just riding it on the street. Like all my friends would just ride a skateboard on
*  the street. Like what happened? Like how did it get to be like grinding across benches
*  and railings? Like I think there's a, well, there's a pretty deep history there of how
*  it got there, but skating was just more like a transportation toy. And then it was really
*  the Dogtown crew that took it to a new level where it was like, oh, you can use this to
*  do aerials and skate swimming pools. And they were just trying to emulate their surfing.
*  And so then skate parks started cropping up, skating got popular in the late seventies,
*  early eighties, and then it was all swimming pools. And then maybe like four years later,
*  the skateboarding kind of started falling in popularity. The skate parks couldn't get
*  their insurance anymore because the liability was crazy. And so then the streets became
*  the skate park because there was nowhere else to go. And there were a few key skaters that
*  figured out how to use like the urban landscape as a skate park. And then that was it. Like
*  all bets are off. Skating kind of took off in the underground as the street culture,
*  street sport. And then people started doing handrails, ledges, benches, stairs, because
*  they just didn't have parks.
*  How much of an impact did the internet have on it? Because it seems like once kids could
*  see all these YouTube videos of people doing all this crazy shit, it must have really accelerated
*  it.
*  I think what it did, I mean, especially in the last 10 years, even the playing field,
*  you didn't have to live in Southern California. You didn't have to live in New York or be
*  near where the industry is. You can just be in your little town. As long as you're putting
*  out content and it's progressive, you're going to get noticed. And I think that's awesome.
*  That is awesome. Yeah, that's one of the cool things about it. Like you said, evened out
*  the playing field.
*  Yeah. And, you know, people are making careers as skaters now in the most unlikely places.
*  Well, you are the Lance Armstrong of skating. And this is what I mean. I don't mean that
*  you got caught doing drugs. What I mean is that you're the guy, like when people talk
*  about professional skaters, Tony Hawk, like, I don't know a single fucking bike rider other
*  than Lance Armstrong. I mean, Greg, there was that other guy, Greg Lamond. Yeah. See,
*  but I can't remember him real quick. But for you, it's that's got to be strange because
*  like you were the first and you're for sure the most prominent. Like how did you pull
*  that off?
*  Well, mostly longevity by surviving the first wave of skating in the 80s. Or it was actually
*  kind of the second wave of skating in the 80s where I had a pretty good career. I was
*  doing really well in competition, especially in the in the mid to late 80s. And then as
*  skating kind of went underground, I never quit and started my own skate company in 1992.
*  And then when the X Games came into play, I was still kind of on top of my game. I did
*  really well there. And I think a lot of people carried over my name from that that first
*  round where they were skaters in the 80s and now maybe their kids skate. And they're like,
*  I remember that guy, you know, and their kids are watching me on the X Games. And then when
*  our video game came out in 1999, that's when everything changed for sure.
*  You were famous for skating when you were like 17 or something, right?
*  I turned pro when I was 14. Yeah. And then but I mean that when I say that, it seems
*  it might seem magical. But at the time, skating was this little tiny scene. So when I first
*  when I literally went pro, I filled was filling out an entry form to a competition. And I
*  already reached the top of the amateur ranks and there was a little box that said pro and
*  a little box that said am. So I clicked. I checked the pro box. That was it. I was pro.
*  No one was offering me a contract. No one had champagne. You know what I mean? And like
*  my coach was I'll never forget Stacey Prolete was looking over my shoulder and I checked
*  it and he's like, okay, that's it. That was it. Yeah.
*  Wow. But you had a coach. We had a team manager. He's the one who put me on
*  what is now considered the Bones Brigade, but the company was Pal Peralta. And that
*  was sort of the elite crew of skaters in the in the early eighties. And I was the super
*  young newbie on the team, like super skinny dorky kid. And a lot of the guys that were
*  established were like this guy really. What is that? That's me at age 17. Wow. Time flies.
*  Does it freak you out looking at that? I think it's I mean, I see that photo making
*  the rounds. So it's cool. I'm actually so by the time I turned 17, I was kind of doing
*  well in competition and making money. So I'm literally sitting outside of my house that
*  I bought while I was a senior in high school in that photo, which was a challenge trying
*  to stay focused on schoolwork when you have the party house. That's crazy. You own a fucking
*  house. Yeah. Wow. A duplex. But yeah, it was my own place. But you know, like when you're
*  a senior, oh, this so and so's parents are out of town parties at his house. Like my
*  parents were never home. So everyone's gone to my house. But what did your parents think
*  about you buying a house? It was my dad's idea. Really? Yeah. Because he saw me really
*  not understanding finances or how lucky I was. And I was just throwing money away, you know,
*  on cars and trips and sharper image and just the most ridiculous things. And then he's
*  like, I really think you should invest your money. Did you get a massage chair, sharper
*  image massage chair? No. But I bought between okay, this is a long story. But my sister
*  and I went in on a tanning bed together. It was like, I used it once. She used it because
*  she it was helpful to her skin. I'm not gonna say why. But you know, she had a legitimate
*  reason for it. But I was like, yeah, tanning bed. Like, we're gonna go tan. But you know,
*  you got to have it. Where did you live at the time? In North County, San Diego, Carlsbad.
*  You don't need a tanning bed. Exactly. Yeah. That was it. The first time I went, I was
*  like, why am I laying in that? I just go to the side. 350 days a year. Yeah, that's hilarious.
*  But I mean, it's it almost you know, when you're that age and you're you're doing well,
*  you think that some other some status symbol. Did you sleep in that house by yourself when
*  you were 17? No, I had three roommates. Oh, god, that's all crazy. One was a little bit
*  older. He was a good friend of mine, pro skater. And he was the only guy that actually had
*  a job. And he was tortured for like two years. Because we were up super late all the time
*  making noise. And you'd have to get up at, you know, 7am go to work. He was doing he
*  was doing line stripping, like back when you'd have to color separate for magazines
*  and stuff like that. Oh, what a bummer for him. Such a bummer. Yeah. And still trying
*  like he's still trying to make it as a pro skater. But clearly he had to get a job and
*  must be an exhausted too. Yeah, he would leave these kind of nasty notes for us in the morning.
*  So when you in high school, like so you're a senior year in high school, you had your
*  own place. Did you do any schoolwork at all? I did. Yeah. Um, you must have been like,
*  well, fuck this. I can already buy a house. I don't know. I think it was more because
*  my parents valued education. My mom was an educator. She was actually like taught in
*  a college. So I felt that I was going to be a disappointment if I didn't at least graduate
*  high school. And I was always pretty advanced. Like I was in the gifted program and you know,
*  I was a great ahead and a lot of the subjects. So by the time I was a senior, I only needed
*  four classes to graduate. So I went to school until lunchtime every day and then I was out.
*  Oh, wow. And then I got my diploma and my dad not strongly suggested I go look at colleges.
*  And so just to humor him, I went looking at like a, you know, a city college in our area
*  and looked around the campus like, oh, that's cool. I guess. Sure. And I just knew that
*  it was my opportunity to really chase this and to embrace all these opportunities I was
*  getting. I mean, I was, I was literally out of high school onto a Hollywood movie set
*  gleaming the cube. Oh, that's right. So I was out, just graduated high school and then
*  moved to North Hollywood for two months. That was like what? 86? It was, it was shot in
*  88, I think 87. Wow. God, I'm remembering that now. Wow. What a, what a crazy way to
*  go from being a young kid to like right into your manhood. It's, it's deceiving though.
*  I mean, especially when you have that much success at a young age, you think, you think
*  it's never going to end. Right. You think you're invincible. And I definitely sometimes
*  treated it as such where I was just like, whoo, you know, just throw money away. And,
*  and like I said, my dad was encouraging me to save it. And then it all came crashing
*  down in about like 1991, 92, where my, my paycheck was all based on royalties of skate
*  products and it started getting cut in half every month. Whoa. Just from lack of interest,
*  lack of sales. Why did it drop? It was it just a liability thing? It was that and just
*  skating was considered a fad. And it was just like, and, and also my style of skating, I
*  was, I skated the ramps, right? So I'm a vert skater. Vert skating was just instantly not
*  cool because street skating had taken over. So I was considered this dinosaur and it was
*  just like, you're out, skating's not cool and you're not cool in skating. Wow. So it
*  was rough. That was like, I would say sort of 92 to 95 ish were, were very lean.
*  So you were trying to figure out like, Hey, what am I doing? I got really good at this.
*  Were you thinking I got to find something else to do?
*  Yes and no. I knew I wouldn't quit skating because I just loved it. Like I never did
*  it for the money. You know, I started, there were no, no one could be rich or famous from
*  skating. So that was never the objective. It was just because I loved what it brought
*  to me. I love the self-confidence it brought to me. I love the creativity. I love the,
*  the misfit crew, the community of it. And so when things started to go south financially,
*  I knew I wouldn't quit. I just had to figure out how to make ends meet. And I actually
*  had a video editing system and I learned how to do that very early, like right when nonlinear
*  video started happening. I had a system. So I started doing freelance work for companies
*  doing video editing, super random, some skate companies. And then I did exhibitions. Like we
*  were doing exhibitions in amusement park parking lots. We weren't even in the amusement park.
*  We're like in the parking lot as people walk in as entertainment, you know, and doing that
*  for like a hundred bucks a day. Wow. But it, but it allowed me to skate and allowed me to pay the
*  rent. And it was like, that was good enough for me. But were you thinking that this is going to
*  stop totally? Well, it was definitely felt like it was heading that way. But I, like I said,
*  I was trying to, I was just trying to do whatever I could. So I was trying to learn different skills
*  and you know, maybe skating wasn't going to pay the bills, but I couldn't let it go for my life.
*  Wow. That's a great story. It was a, and you brought it back. Yeah, I guess.
*  I mean, a lot of ways, right? It was, it started to slowly come back really when the X Games
*  came into play, whereas suddenly we were, we were on TV and kids could see how much skating had
*  evolved. Well, the whole public could see how much skating had evolved from the time that they
*  last saw it in the late eighties. And then they were seeing it. And it was just like, whoa, these
*  guys are, this is for real. You know, this is for lack of a better word, this is a sport. These guys
*  are doing acrobatic things and it takes discipline and it takes, it takes determination and kids
*  recognize that. And I think they, you know, that's really when skating started to spark again.
*  And this is like 95 ish? Probably more closer to 96, 97. The first X Games was a little strange,
*  a little scattered because it was like skateboarding and bungee jumping and rock climbing
*  and sky surfing. They were just throwing everything. And then it really rubbed us the
*  wrong way because suddenly we were labeled as extreme. And it was like, what do you do? I
*  skateboard. Oh, you're into extreme sports. No, I skateboard. I don't know. Yeah, that's a weird
*  category, right? That extreme sports. It was just anything. Yeah. And that was, I mean, really it
*  was coined by ESPN. So that's why they changed it to X Games. So the first one was extreme games,
*  95. They changed the X Games in 96. I think they really found their, their niche a few years later
*  when they really sort of started to weed out all the random stuff. And it was more about skateboarding,
*  BMX, motocross. Like those became really the highlights and the reason people were tuning in.
*  And then that's when things really exploded. And what were like the early skateboarding events in
*  X Games? Like what did you? It was, it was street and vert. And so vert came back. Yeah. Yeah. A lot
*  of it for us. I think it was really because ESPN recognized that vert is a spectator sport. Yeah,
*  that was going to say for us on the outside, we would watch it to see someone fall spectacularly.
*  Yeah, because you guys would go, you would hit those ramps and you would watch people just
*  fuck up and you're like, Oh my God, look how far he's falling. Right. Yeah, for sure. And then once
*  they got in, you know, once they evolved that into what they call the big air ramps, the mega ramps,
*  then it was just like the, the aerials and the risk factor was tenfold. Yeah. The risk factor.
*  I mean, I've seen some wipeouts that are just, they're baffling. I think when, when things
*  started to really explode with that, with the big air thing, and then Jake Brown had his big
*  accident, the one that kind of everyone saw went viral. You've probably seen him where he's just
*  falling from like 30 feet up. That's when they started to, I don't want to say tone it down,
*  but really they started to figure out how to do it in a way that is still progressive, but not just
*  throwing caution to the wind and not just trying to break all the height and spin records. It was
*  just bad. You know, they really refined it. He, I mean, surprisingly, he, I think he broke his hand,
*  maybe his, his, uh, heel and had like internal bruising, but that's it. It was, I mean, it was
*  really unbelievably lucky. Yeah. I watched that and I was like, this guy, there's no way this guy's
*  going to live. And then, yeah. And then, and then, you know, they didn't have the proper protocol in
*  place. They just let him walk off the ramp. It was nuts. Yeah. It was, uh, but, but it was definitely,
*  uh, shocked to the system. And like I said, they started to refine that event where it's just like,
*  all right, you guys, you know, let's just, we're comfortable at this certain height. Let's just
*  stick with that. Yeah. Even all the skaters said it themselves. They're like, well, we can really
*  work on new tricks at this height instead of trying to go to the moon, go to the moon. Right.
*  Yeah. It's just, it was, is there an issue with CTE with skaters?
*  Um, well, it's definitely a concern. Yeah. Um, I haven't, I can't say that I know many examples of
*  it, but I, I'm not following people past their careers necessarily, you know, except for close
*  friends. You know, Jason Ellis, of course. Yeah. Ellis, uh, I think he told me he's been knocked
*  out like seven or eight times, like out cold. I, I, yeah, I definitely at least that for me.
*  Um, yeah. Wow. Uh, I mean, I've had probably by all accounts over the years, at least like 30,
*  uh, you know, either semi concussions or heavy con, I'd say like three or four heavy concussions,
*  but out cold. Yeah. How cold just three or four times woke up in the ambulance. Yeah.
*  Um, and I don't take that lightly. Like I don't, uh, and, and especially with all the information
*  that we have now and with all the research I went and proactively tried to figure out
*  if I'm susceptible because, uh, did you get that gene check? I did. Yeah. What is it? APOE four?
*  Is that what it is? Yes, I believe so. Um, I do not have the gene that makes me susceptible.
*  And I was even more concerned, I mean, because my, my mom, uh, she passed away recently, but she had
*  Alzheimer's dementia and it makes you more susceptible to Alzheimer's dementia. Um, and not
*  just CTE. I mean, I'm, I'm acting like a medical expert. I just, you know, I, I researched it enough
*  to know that, okay, I'm not more at risk for that, but I don't, you know, I'm not, I'm not
*  putting myself out there to be, to have concussions anymore. I'll tell you that. Well, I mean, I'm not
*  doing those kinds of moves that, that I was getting knocked out on. Have you done anything
*  proactively to try to like, um, I take supplements, stuff like that. Yeah. Do you ever heard of a
*  neuro force? No, no, no neuro one, right? Neuro one. There's a bill Romanowski football player
*  created it specifically because he was dealing with a lot of issues, memory issues and the like,
*  okay, because of a head trauma. And, uh, it's like the first new tropic I ever tried. It's really
*  good. It's just like, it's a bunch of new tropics that combined into delicious, but you do feel like
*  your mental capacity. Yeah. There's a bunch of stuff that I take that cranks me up. Uh, alpha
*  brain, which is one that my company makes on it makes, um, there's another one, uh, neuro gum.
*  I really like it's just a gum that has no tropics in it. Um, I'm, I'm willing to try. Yeah. I mean,
*  I would imagine any sort of supplement that would aid the function of your brain foggy or anything
*  Uh, no, I, I only had a couple of concussions that affected me for a longer period of time,
*  like for a week where I couldn't focus or I had other, you know, physical issues. And, um,
*  I don't feel any of those effects like that. No, you're down at San Diego. There's, um, there's
*  an area outside of San Diego that, uh, Katz and Ghana went to, she's a UFC fighter and she fought
*  Amanda Nunez, who's the Panamway champion now currently. And she got a really bad concussion
*  in that fight. It was, it was really fucking her up to the point where her hormones were out of
*  whack. Her cortisol levels were so fucked up. She couldn't, she couldn't keep weight off her,
*  her whole body was just a mess. She was having a hard time with her coordination. And she went to
*  the center that, um, they do some sort of magnetic therapy for people with brain injuries and it
*  restimulates growth in those areas of the brain that have been damaged and brought her back to
*  normal. How, for how long that take? It took a few months and she was going on a regular basis and
*  it was quite a trek for her. I think it was more than an hour drive back and forth and she was
*  doing it, I think every day. And, uh, I believe the center was developed because, you know,
*  San Diego has so much, so much military down there. I believe that's why I live there.
*  My dad was in the Navy. And, uh, I love San Diego. Oh, me too. I'm not leaving. And, um,
*  the mayor actually just asked to go into stage three. They made a request in San Diego to go
*  into stage three of the recovery from coronavirus. Like everything's great down here. Let's,
*  I know the rest of the city or the rest of the state is having issues in some spots,
*  particularly Los Angeles, but he feels ready to rock and roll and push. I keep getting different,
*  uh, different views, different news, different, different guidelines. So I don't, I, you know,
*  I'm just kind of like, um, go out, wearing a mask, doing, you know, trying to
*  follow the guidelines as possible, as much as possible while still leading a relatively normal
*  life. Yeah. It's a weird time, right? It's yeah. And, and the strange part to me is the, the, the
*  great divide in terms of, for instance, um, my daughter loves to get bagels in the morning
*  before school. So I still try to do that with her sometimes so she can feel like we're doing a normal
*  school day even before she goes online. And the bagel shop says like face mask required and people
*  just walk in without them and give you dirty looks for wearing the mask. And it's just like,
*  I'm just following the rules of the place. Like, yeah, just like, this isn't some war of politics
*  here. I'm just following what they're asking me to do. That's so weird. Yeah. It's, it's really,
*  it's like they're making a stand by not. I'm like, okay, well, you know, it's the same theory as no
*  shirt, no shoes, no shirt, no service. Like, except your stinky feet doesn't get someone sick.
*  You know what I mean? It's, it's a little different. It's a fucking weird time and it's a weird time
*  politically. It seems like, uh, the Corona viruses is a line in the sand politically.
*  Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's a strange time. And like I said, I'm just,
*  you know, doing my best to follow the guidelines, the experts and, um, and still try to maintain
*  a semblance of normalcy from my family. Um, so that, you know, we feel like we,
*  there's light at the end of the tunnel. Yeah, we all feel that way. Yeah. It's, um,
*  just California in particular is a very restrictive state when it comes to the recovery.
*  And maybe that's a good thing. Maybe that's a bad thing. We really won't know for months,
*  you know? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I'm still like there certain appearances and events and things
*  that, uh, have been so-called postponed. Some are still are very optimistic where they think,
*  okay, we're going to do it in July. Like you think, you think so? I don't know. Or August or,
*  well, we're going to push it back. And it's just, um, I just don't know what to believe. And, you
*  know, I, I got a, I got a schedule for doing some promotional stuff for our video game coming out
*  in September. And it's like, okay, August going to Europe. Like, are you sure? I don't know.
*  Are we going to be let in? Am I going to have to wait in quarantine for two weeks when I land? Like,
*  I don't know. Yeah, I have a bunch of dates. Um, I've got one in July in Vegas, and then I've got
*  a bunch in New Orleans. I got one in New Orleans, one in Nashville with, with Chappelle. And we're
*  just like, hopefully it happens. Yeah. But it's like September 4th and 5th. Like, really? I mean,
*  who, I mean, maybe it's, I never thought this was going to happen. I never thought we'd be sitting
*  around in May going, there's no way we're going to be open in August. I thought it was just going to
*  be, we closed down for a month. You know, we take this financial hit, but, uh, you know,
*  the virus settles down. Everybody can get back to where we get testing or whatever, whatever takes
*  place, some sort of therapeutic relief, something where it comes along some sort of a treatment.
*  No, no, not yet. Yeah. Yeah. I don't. Yeah. It's weird. Yeah. I remember when, when a couple of
*  my events got canceled and I was in shock then, right. And now I'm more in shock that they're
*  trying to reschedule. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's interesting how quickly you get used to
*  this new normal too. Right. Like now when I watch movies and people are hugging and handshaking,
*  I'm like, Oh yeah. Yeah. I had a, um, I was going to be in this commercial. I mean, I don't know if
*  they want me to say what it is or whatever, but, but they had to delay it. Cause there's like,
*  eh, yeah, it's not the right time to put that one out, but that's, we know we didn't shoot it.
*  Right. Right. Right. Yeah. It doesn't matter. We didn't shoot it yesterday. That's so weird.
*  Like perception, like just, just, just the appearance of. Yeah. I mean, I, I understand
*  it was gotta be careful and whatever. I'm just, I was just super excited to be in it. So I was
*  like, no, but they're going to put it out there. Statistically, at least San Diego seems to have
*  taken it much better than Los Angeles to in terms of like, uh, fatalities. And one of the
*  superintendents was a supervisor or superintendent said that there's only six deaths that can be
*  directly attributed to nothing but coronavirus and everything else had people with underlying
*  causes, which is pretty extraordinary. Oh, wow. Yeah. I don't know if he's right though. Yeah. I
*  don't, I mean, yeah, he's a conservative. It's so hard to know what to believe too. That's the
*  problem, right? Yeah. That's the problem. When you like San Diego is a really healthy place. Like
*  every time I'm down there, like Pacific beach way, like any, like people are always running
*  and biking. It's like, yeah, especially North County door Z. Yep. I would imagine just that alone
*  would lend itself to people having stronger immune systems. I would hope so. Um, but like I said,
*  it's still, it still feels like a great divide even there. Really? Yeah. Where, where people,
*  you know, when, when they open the beaches and then there was only one beach in our area open
*  and it was like spring break, just nuts. Yeah. And then, you know, people are frustrated with
*  each other. What are you doing? You're putting everyone at risk and it just was a mess. And
*  then they're like, all right, now it's closed down for good. And then everyone just goes up to
*  Newport or wherever they can. And then got more crowded there. And it's just, it was, it was a
*  mess. Well, they're all, I don't, they're pretty open now, right? Isn't that the new thing? You
*  can go surfing, but you can't park on the beach. Um, that's so stupid, which is, which is very
*  challenging, but Hey, well at least we're surfing, but that's so dumb. Why can't you park there? If
*  you're like, what's happening to people when they park? It's like some of these rules are so arbitrary.
*  Um, yeah. And like, and, and you never know what, you know, what, what is the rule now changes day
*  by day, but, uh, it does feel like there's definitely a slow opening happening. So when
*  we're talking about San Diego being like very fit place, do you do any sort of strength and
*  conditioning or anything for skateboarding? Is that something that people do? Some people do it.
*  I never found it to help my skating and I always felt like skating kept me fit. So I never really
*  did it. I mean, outside of swimming and surfing, which is more upper body than skating obviously,
*  but, um, but I do feel like that would have benefited me later in life. I just got stuck
*  in my mode and then just skating was it. You stay there. You're in your mode now. You don't do
*  anything. I don't do anything else. I do. I do make an effort to like swim some laps. Um, cause my mom
*  lived, uh, till her nineties and she swore by swimming. Oh, swimming is amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
*  she would go, you know, through, I mean, I remember all as a kid, she would definitely, she had to get
*  her 20 laps in every day. Um, and, and we, we are, are, uh, where I live, the residential area had
*  a community swimming pool that was like Olympic size. So that was a good thing. Yeah. Yeah. We were
*  talking before about, uh, surfing and I was saying that I think that surfing at least partially would
*  kind of mimic some of the muscles that you use in skateboarding. And then you were telling me about
*  getting towed in by Laird Hamilton while you drink his coffee. Wow. Um, yeah. So, well, my brother,
*  my older brother was a surfer and he got me into skating because he skated in the seventies when
*  that was the thing was they were trying to emulate surfing with the skateboards. And so he actually
*  gave me one of his old boards. That was my first skateboard. Um, and then he would drive me to the
*  skate park once a week, like come home from college and take me to the park. And then I just got hooked.
*  Like that was, that was my home away from home from that point on. Um, and so I surf pretty
*  regularly, I would say less now, but, um, but it was hard not to with my brother's influence.
*  And we were in Hawaii. My brother actually used to be the, uh, editor of surfer magazine.
*  So he knows all the surfers. Um, cause he's really, he's a journalist, um, really good writer, uh,
*  teaches at Stanford now actually. And so we went to Hawaii, we went to Maui and he said,
*  Hey, Laird said he'd take us out toe in surfing. If you want to go, like we're going to go tones
*  over with Laird Hamilton. Like the, I don't think his level of what is mellow is something that is
*  what we would consider. And he's, and I go, but you know, we got to go like it's once in a lifetime.
*  Right. So they took us out, uh, to Spreckel's, which is near Jaws, which is their big spot.
*  This is like early two thousands. So toe in serving was just starting to come into play.
*  I'll never forget Dave Kalama, who's one of the surfers, one of his homies,
*  he was trying out the first foil board there. Oh wow. And he had, he was wearing ski boots
*  attached to the foil board. That's how he was riding it. I was like, these guys are out of their
*  minds. And, uh, and so, uh, detach like a ski boot. If you fall, I never saw it detach.
*  Oh my God. Yeah. So you have to recover and swim to the surface while you're permanent.
*  I was too focused on trying to survive myself to worry about what he was doing.
*  But, um, yeah. So, uh, Rush Randall, who's another, um, windsurfer there, he was towing me and Laird
*  is towing my brother and I'll never forget them being outside and then, you know, they're saying
*  it's a small day and they're like, Oh, I think there might be like some 10 or 12 foot sets. And
*  I know what 10 or 12 foot in Hawaiian measurement means. And I was like, kid, just don't tow me into
*  one of those. Okay. And, uh, and then I'll never forget looking out and Rush said, here comes one.
*  I'm like, where, where? Cause you're so far out. Right. And he's like, get ready. Okay. And so then
*  I got ready and I'm getting towed and all of a sudden this thing, this mountain just swells up
*  underneath me. And before I know it, I'm just in the pit of this move, this way that was like
*  double overhead, biggest wave I've ever written for sure. Um, and for me it's backside. So when
*  you're going backside, you're just sort of looking down the line. You're not looking back at the,
*  at the barrel. What does that mean by backside? Um, so the wave is breaking this way and my back,
*  is to the face of the wave. Oh, okay. Right. And it backsides a little more challenging
*  just because of the, the turning and the way you're facing. So when you go in front side,
*  you're facing the wave. You can really see down the line. You can go back easily. Um, so I'm going
*  backside and I remembered looking, looking at the wall, thinking like I've written 20 foot skate ramps
*  and I'm like, that's, that looks like about a 20 foot skate ramp. So I was going and I was cruising
*  and then I did a little cutback. So I started going to back towards the barrel and I looked
*  at the barrel and it was like the most frightening thing I've ever seen in my life. Cause it was,
*  you know, it was like a massive hollow wave that you see in movies that you see Larry just dancing
*  around in. And I'm like, I can't, I'm not getting near that thing. And I immediately just turned
*  back and went down the line even further and just get ahead of it. Um, and then I did find myself
*  after a few waves getting cocky and I tried to pull into the barrel and it just clobbered me in
*  the head. And then I, you know, you weren't a life vest. And then I went down, I'll never forget,
*  like I felt myself going down one shelf and, you know, trying to swim up to the top. And then I
*  felt it go down another shelf and I was like, Oh, this is bad. Um, and then finally made it up to
*  the surface and rush is like three feet from me. Cause he's just been chasing those guys are,
*  they're the masters experts and recovering people that get clobbered. Yeah. Fuck. And I
*  was just like, how long were you down for? I, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't like a crazy hold down,
*  but in my inexperience and not conditioned body, it felt like a long time. Um, and I,
*  and I told rush, I was like, Oh, that was so scary. And I was never been held down that much. He's
*  like, yeah, I've had my worst hold downs out here. Cool. Thanks. I was telling you, you know,
*  I get in the sauna every day and I said something to Larry and he sent me a picture of his sauna.
*  Pull it up here. It's he's at 250 fucking degrees in his sauna. I mean, I don't even understand
*  why he would do that, but he's like, I'm pissed that this thing doesn't go any hotter.
*  Let me, yeah, he lives on a different plane. He gets in there with oven mitts at 250 degrees with,
*  here it is. Look at this crazy motherfucker. Look at that. So does he wear oven mitts so his skin
*  won't melt off? Yeah. Cause he rides his fucking air dyne bike. Oh my God. So the metal of the
*  air dyne bike would literally cook him. I mean, I cook a steak at 250 degrees and the smoker,
*  this is crazy. And it's 200. It's actually like probably it's, it's pinned at 250 because that's
*  as hot as this thermostat gets. Oh yeah. Right. Like it's probably hotter than 250.
*  He's out of his fucking mind. Yeah. He's nuts. Um, he's fascinating. More is always better is his
*  quote to me. I just, there's gotta be a point. I did it once here. I was trying to, after he came
*  on the podcast, I was trying to copy him. So I was doing it at like 210 and I did once at 220.
*  I was burning like the inside of my throat from breathing in the air. I was, I felt like cooking
*  myself cause I was in there for like 20 minutes. I was like, and then I'd get out and it was as
*  tired as I've ever been in my life. I would just collapse on the mats after I got out of the sauna.
*  I was like, I gotta stop doing this. And then I'd come in and do podcasts and like, I was having a
*  hard time talking. I was like, like my throat was, was cooked. It was basically getting cooked.
*  Yeah. I never did well with that stuff. I, we, um, we got one, actually we got one of the infrared
*  ones. Those are different. Those are the, he, he doesn't like the infrared ones. Laird said that
*  they gave him a real bad skin condition and that like, there's something about, it's particularly
*  the temperatures that he's putting them at. Yeah. Well, I gotta start somewhere. I'm not gonna.
*  Well, I think the dry heat, it's like, that's where the studies have been done on them. And
*  I'm sure there's some benefits to the infrared one, but according to him, he's not into it.
*  Yeah. Well, I don't, like I said, I don't really do it anyway. Um, my wife, my kids, they like going
*  in there, but I usually go in for a little bit and like, we'll watch one episode of something.
*  And I'm like, okay, I'm done. Have you done his crazy water workouts? No way. No, I would never
*  survive that. Not at this. No, I have a bunch of friends that have gone up there and train with
*  them. But then they just text me afterwards. What the fuck? Yeah. Cause he's just not, no one,
*  no one can, can go easy. No, he's not. There's no easy with Larry. There's only two speeds.
*  I was telling you about his ankle. If people don't know, he came in here and showed me his ankle.
*  He has an ankle that broke that he never did anything to. He never bothered getting a cast.
*  He never bothered getting it surgery. And it's, it's like the root of a tree. It's this
*  fucked up thick ass knee of an ankle. It's so weird. And like, wow, that's next level.
*  He's just a next level human. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I, I respect him and
*  admire him, but I don't want him to train me. Well, his workouts are so crazy. Like they take a
*  75 pound dumbbell and they swim with it. Like the whole 75 pound dumbbell. And then you're
*  swimming across the pool with one arm while holding the 75 pound dumbbell while trying to
*  pop your head up and breathe. I'm like, Oh, okay. Yeah. Whatever. Yeah. So, uh, not, not my
*  conditioning, but I liked it. There's a guy like that out there for sure. I think it's important
*  leading the charge. Yeah. Just some fucking maniac exactly. Who's just so, he's so psycho
*  about everything. The guy sends you a 250 degree sauna that he's mad. That doesn't get any higher.
*  It's just so interesting. But I think like it turns of a guy like that, who's like a world famous
*  big wave surfer guy, you almost have to have that kind of mentality. And I would imagine the same
*  thing, at least in some way has to transfer over to skating and to kind of everything. Right.
*  I think so. I think, I think that there's a, well, there's one, there's an adventurous spirit,
*  but also there's a sense of self-confidence that you gain and that you explore. Like you want to
*  see how much further you can take it. You want to test the limits. Um, and I identify with that for
*  sure. Uh, that's always been my drive to come up with new tricks. Like I knew the first time I ever
*  did a trick, like a new trick and one that hadn't been done before the buzz that I got from it was
*  what I've been, it's what I've been chasing my whole life. You know, the idea that I've,
*  I created something new, like just on my own with my own thoughts and, and, uh, creativity and that
*  like I did it my own way. And you know, skateboarding was like that. It was like this art form to me,
*  where you, there's this blank canvas and it's just like, go make it your own. Oh,
*  that's an interesting way to look at it. I never thought of it that way. Yeah. I mean,
*  it really is cool to look at. So it's, it is an art form. Sure. And it's like, you could show me
*  a picture of two people doing the same trick, silhouette it, and I could tell you who it is.
*  You know what I mean? Because everyone has their own style and they put their own flavor on it. And,
*  and that's what I love. Like I love that it's, it's subjective like that. You know,
*  people think of it like they don't like skaters themselves, especially the more hardcore purists
*  don't like to call it a sport. They're like, we're not a sport. Like, well,
*  there's legitimate competition. So yeah, there is a sporting element to it, but I agree. It is more
*  of an art form and a lifestyle because how can you, you're comparing apples to oranges always.
*  That's real similar in a lot of ways to martial arts in that, uh, like if I saw a silhouette of
*  certain people, I'd say, oh, that's, you know, that's John Jones or that's John Wayne Parr. Like
*  you could tell by the way someone moves like right away. Yeah. You just put, cause you put your stamp
*  on it and that's what I love about it because it's so diverse. Yeah. When you come up with a move,
*  like what's your process? You just skate and fuck around and have some fun and then go,
*  no, no, I just try this. It's always different. Uh, a lot of times it's like, how do we combine,
*  how can I combine these two things that I know I have dialed in? Like, can I make them work together?
*  Sometimes it's a happy accident. Like you go try something, your board spins the other way and it's
*  like, well, wait, if I caught it there, that would have worked out. Um, I, I, yesterday, I literally
*  created a new trick yesterday. Yeah. Because we are doing this, uh, when will this air?
*  Tomorrow. Um, well we're doing a, we're doing sort of a, uh, we call it an NBD best trick event at
*  my ramp. NBD means never been done. Um, and so my idea was that, and this is all, this will all
*  come out, but, um, my idea was that while we're all stuck, you know, doing this social distancing
*  and whatnot, let's do a best trick event where everyone gets one hour on my ramp, all the best
*  vert skaters. So you get one hour to do it, get a trick on video. So it's literally just one dude
*  and one, one skater and one filmer at the ramp at a time. And I was the guinea pig.
*  So yesterday morning was like, all right, you're the first hour go. And, uh, and I had to come up
*  with this trick and I started trying one that I had been working on and it just kept slipping away,
*  like getting worse every attempt. And so I went, I went and sort of switched gears into a trick that
*  I had tried a couple months ago and was like, if you're ever going to make this happen, this is it.
*  And, uh, finally one just clicked and I made it and it was like, it was, it was the combination
*  of two tricks that I have pretty dialed, but putting them together added this element of,
*  of, um, just so much to miss. Like they all, you know, everything had to come together
*  at the exact moment and land on my feet on the coping in the right position. And,
*  and I knew if I got it once I'd make it, but like, I'm never going to do that trick again.
*  That's how technical it is. Where I just know that, okay, I got that one done it,
*  got it on video. I don't want to go through that again. Now, how much, I don't know about skating.
*  So like, forgive me if this is an ignorant question, but how much improvement has there
*  been in the wheels, in the boards, in the components and all, and all the different things,
*  like, are there things you can do now today that just really weren't possible when you first started
*  skating? Only in the, well, when I first started skating, skateboards were all over the place. So
*  they were made of different materials. They were different with like all different shapes. Um,
*  they, you know, the urethane had just come into play, but I would say for the last 30 years,
*  it's pretty much the same construction. Seven ply wood, maple skateboards, uh, trucks have not
*  changed. Um, wheels have changed in size and hardness, but it's still the same urethane for
*  the most part. So there hasn't been a lot of huge advancements. The big, the big changes are the
*  shapes of the boards. Now, why have they, um, stuck with plywood? What about like carbon fiber,
*  anything synthetic? That is, that's the big question and, and something that I would like
*  to pursue, but we really need a sea change in skateboarding with materials. I believe that.
*  And we've, we haven't found anything that, that, uh, responds the same. Um, or, you know, the other
*  thing is skaters as, as much as they are very progressive and, you know, they like to be,
*  do different things and, and, um, go outside, think outside the box and whatnot. If you try to
*  sell them a deck that's, you know, 200 bucks, that's, that's gonna be hard. Even if you can
*  convince them that it's going to last three times long, four times long. So is it just a money thing
*  or are they married? We just haven't really found like there's some, some people have done, uh,
*  different construction where they add a different ply in and that has worked a little bit. Um, but,
*  uh, like I said, there just hasn't been that, that one seed planted where it's like, all right,
*  this is it. I would imagine carbon fiber. I, I tried something along those lines and it just,
*  like I said, didn't, it didn't have that reflex. Does it have to have a certain amount of weight
*  to it too? Cause that, that, well, that's the other thing where we're kind of stuck where this is,
*  this is how skateboard should weigh. Right. And so if you bring in something that's way lighter,
*  maybe that's not the answer, but we don't know. It just, you know, it takes R and D for sure.
*  And you would have to get someone really good to fuck with it too. Right. Yeah. And to believe in
*  it. Yeah. And get behind it. Yeah. When I was a kid, there was no 50 year old rock stars, you know,
*  like, you know what I'm saying? We thought of rock stars as they were in their twenties and thirties
*  and then they just kind of like, we thought they faded away. Like the beach boys, everybody felt
*  sad about the beach boys when I was a kid, but not anymore. You know, now Mick Jagger is like
*  fucking almost 80 years old and he's rocking after heart surgery and shit. And the same is kind of
*  true with skaters, right? Because when, when we were kids, when you became famous, you were,
*  you were like the first wave, right? Or one of the first waves and certainly the most famous,
*  you're 52 and you're still considered, like, is that a weird thing that you're a,
*  it is weird. It's, it's, well, it's fun. It's great that you can still do it. And then you're still,
*  you know, I mean, you're also, it's not like you're a dinosaur, you're accepted. Like you're,
*  you're a skater. It's like just, you just happen to be 52. You know what I mean? Yeah. Well, it went
*  through the years. So when I first started skating, the, the sort of unspoken rule was once you're
*  at an age of responsibility, you're 18, you got to get a job. You can't skate for a living. No one
*  can. So, you know, your skating career is over by then. And then as I turned 18, things started to
*  sort of ramp up with skating, forgive the pun, but, and things started to kind of explode. And
*  I remember around that time, there was a photo in Thrasher of this guy, Mark Lake, who was an
*  older skater at the time. And he was a picture of him doing one of those hand plant like upside down
*  on a ramp. And it was like Mark Lake 30 and still going for it. And I remember I was like in my early
*  20s thinking that's crazy. He's 30. Right. And then as things progress, like we realized that,
*  that we're all sort of, if we're, if we're able to do this for a living and we can really pursue
*  it and we have support, we are, we're getting better into our thirties. I mean, I, you know,
*  when I did the 900, the X games, I was 31. Wow. And so then it was just like, well,
*  what is the limit? I don't know. I'm, I guess I'm sort of the guinea pig now or leading the charge
*  of, of what, how far you can take it. And I've definitely started, I've refined my style. So I'm
*  not doing big impact stuff. I'm not doing the more, you know, the big spins, the big errors and
*  stuff. I've learned to get more technical with my skating and that has allowed me to stay creative,
*  but maintain my health. Yeah. That's why I was asking you about strength and conditioning.
*  Cause if you're an older athlete, it's, it's a mandatory thing in almost every sport.
*  Yeah. I, it's just, I, I skate for a couple hours a day, I'd say four times a week.
*  Um, and that's pretty much my exercise, but, uh, definitely I could use some help with endurance
*  these days. Well, have you thought about doing something like, what would you do? Uh, I don't
*  know. I guess I would listen to the experts. I would, I would tap you, but you haven't done
*  anything yet, which is amazing. I haven't. Yeah. But like I said, it's just because that's worked
*  for me pretty much my whole life. My only, um, really, uh, ailment is my neck. What's wrong with
*  your neck? Just I've had so many whiplashes, like just, you know, we call them chicken necks
*  cause you shoot out and, and I've had so many like different ways that whenever I'm like, if I'm
*  sitting here and someone were to call me over there, when I go to turn to look at them, they'll,
*  they'll definitely say like, what's wrong with your neck? That happens to me every day. And I'm
*  like, what happened? What's wrong with my neck? I don't know. 40 years of whiplash. Have you got an
*  MRI? Uh, yeah. And I, I do. That's the only thing that I get worked on. So, um, uh, there's a guy
*  near, uh, where I live who does chiropractic, but also does a lot of body work and he just works on
*  my neck once a week. Just massages it. Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever heard of a thing called an iron neck?
*  Yes. Yeah. Have you ever used that? I did try, but, um, it was just awkward.
*  Yeah, it's awkward, but it's really good. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a must have thing for grapplers.
*  You should really try it. Okay. I did it when, um, we, I did sort of this racing training with
*  Cadillac, uh, a couple of years ago and their racers do that. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah.
*  For turning their head, you know, checking the, checking their mirrors. Yeah. Well, it's great
*  for fighters too. Strong neck will keep your head from snapping around. I can imagine the same thing
*  would happen with skaters. Yeah. I've got one out here. You should try it after we're done here.
*  I swear by the thing. It's, it's the best. And it's, it's also, it doesn't fuck with your neck in a way
*  that's unnatural in terms of putting weight on your head and flexing your, your, your discs.
*  It actually keeps your neck stiff as well as, you know, when you're, when you're turning it,
*  it doesn't bend it and unnatural angles and it still strengthens it. I'm a giant fan of it.
*  Okay. Well, I'm, I'm open to ideas. Yeah. Because I would think that like the whiplash thing,
*  that's got to be real simple, similar to what happens with fighters, you know? Oh yeah, for sure.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's weird though. A lot of, like a lot of my peers, they have more knee problems
*  than ankle problems. And I've just realized that all mine's on my neck. You never had any knee
*  problems or ankle problems? I've had, I had surgery. I tore my meniscus and both knees actually got it
*  cut out, tore my PCL, but always came back from it. That's amazing. Yeah. I mean, I feel,
*  I feel pretty lucky. I was always very flexible as a kid. So I know that that was to my advantage
*  for sure. Oh, for sure. And like I said, when I went through the sort of street era of the early
*  nineties, I was rolling my ankles left and right. So I never actually broke an ankle, but, but they're
*  loose. They've got some play. Yeah. Yeah. I was really bummed out, man, because I was seeing that
*  they were trying to keep these kids out of the skate park. So they filled it with sand. I know.
*  You see that shit? Yeah. What the fuck, man? I mean, how much of an effort did it take to do that?
*  And why? That was, that was very strange. But I mean- How are you going to get that sand out of there now?
*  Yeah, good question. No, well, you know what? If, if, if they say skate parks are open, the skaters
*  will do it. They're very, yeah, they're, they're all very DIY resourceful. It's just like, I did
*  see some fun, some helicopter footage on a news feed where there were some guys that actually dug
*  a sort of a path so that they could skate through the park. So they cleared out one area and they
*  kept trying. Like this guy was trying to get a trick on video. So he kept trying the same trick
*  and the helicopters just shoot him. I was like, what world are we living in? So strange. But imagine
*  being in an office somewhere, whatever, you know, government office, and they're like, well,
*  how do we stop these skateboarders? We're going to have to truck in some sand. So they use our money,
*  they use tax money. Probably a lot of it too. If you think about how much sand that must have got.
*  It did seem like a very big effort. Yeah. Fucking giant effort. How about just-
*  The irony is that, is that they're, they're trying to keep skaters out of public areas and
*  school yards and stuff and give them a place to go. And now you're just forcing them back to those
*  days. Yeah. It's not like they're going to stop going to staircases and railings. No, they're
*  going to do it more now. Yeah. It's so dumb. But all of this, it sort of exposes some of the flaws
*  and governance, you know, just- It's very scattered. Well, skateboarding too, it's,
*  it's almost like some people would think of it as a frivolous activity. Sure. You know, it's like,
*  yeah, glorious results of a misspent youth. If you know how to-
*  Oh, absolutely. Flip around a skateboard. Yeah. It's funny. The, when I first started,
*  I have a foundation for public skate parks. We've been going 20 years actually. How does that work?
*  We basically give communities the resources to get a park going. Like if they, if someone in
*  their community has started a petition or fundraising or just raising awareness that they need a park,
*  we sort of give them the roadmap to do that and funding to do it. Oh, that's amazing. And, you
*  know, designed help and things like that. So it's been great. We've helped to fund over 900 skate
*  parks now, all 50 states. We've given away almost $10 million. That's incredible. Yeah. I mean,
*  it's definitely my proudest work. But when I started it, there was a point where I was,
*  we were trying to get funding and trying to raise awareness. And, you know, I'm doing,
*  I'm doing visits to children's cancer wards and stuff like that. And at some point I was like,
*  I'm trying to build skate parks. And I remember this conversation I had very vividly actually
*  with Lance Armstrong when, and this is when he was the face of cancer research. You know what I mean?
*  Like say what you will about his competitive career, but he did so much for cancer awareness
*  and research. And I'm visiting children's hospital with Lance Armstrong. And when Lance Armstrong
*  walks into a cancer ward back then, like the C's part, you know what I mean? It was just like,
*  this, it was like, oh, he's here. And I remember having lunch with him with that day. And I was
*  like, it's so weird to be with you. You're, you're doing so much for cancer and cancer victims. And
*  I'm just trying to build playgrounds. Yeah. Like, you know, concrete waves. And he said, he said,
*  look, the number one cause of cancer or number, you know, number two cause of cancer
*  in the U S is obesity. And by building those skate parks, you are preventing cancer. You're
*  preventing obesity. Wow. And that was heavy for me. That is heavy. And it really gave me
*  a lot of inspiration, you know, and a lot more motivation. Well, you're creating
*  a potential place for joy. Right. And for, you know, for people to like minded people to hang out,
*  like to develop a community. I mean, when I was a kid, like I felt like an outcast. I felt like,
*  like I didn't belong in, in sports. I didn't belong in my school. And when I went to the skate
*  park and there was just this band of misfits listening to punk music and look, you know,
*  weird heritage from all walks of life. I was like, this is it. This is my crew. And I want the same
*  sense of community for, you know, we're not trying to build training grounds for Olympians. We're
*  just trying to build a place for them to feel like they belong and feel like their community
*  actually cares about them. Yeah. And it is a loved pursuit. I mean, even though it's had these weird
*  views, like, or people have had weird views about it. If you think about how many people love it
*  and how it requires this sort of a place, like what you're creating to really do it right.
*  And nowadays, I mean, it's way different now, the sort of perspective on skating or the attitude
*  towards skating is that parents are doing with their kids, like, you know, and little girls are
*  encouraged to try it. And that just wasn't the case when I was a kid. Like, I think it's because
*  of you in a lot of ways. Oh, well, thank you. I mean, I was always happy to at least advocate
*  for skating and try to explain to people like this has a real positive impact on kids. You're
*  too focused on the hairdos and the music and stuff. You got to really look at what it provides
*  someone's mentality. Yeah. But that's always been the case with things that kids do that their
*  parents didn't do. Sure. Like how many parents told their kids to stop playing video games
*  and now kids are literally making millions of dollars playing video games and parents have to
*  kind of make this adjustment like, okay. Yeah. Okay. So I think the generation of parents now
*  grew up at a time when skating was starting to be cool. Yeah. Okay. So either they're encouraging
*  of their kids skating or they're actually skating with them. That's awesome. That's got to make you
*  feel good. It is very cool. Yeah. Real impact on the thing that you love. Yeah. I mean, the coolest
*  part is for me is that I still get to participate and I get to bear witness to all this. Like,
*  who's the oldest skater? Is there a really old dude out there shredded? Sure. I mean, the name,
*  like even that some of the Z-boy guys like Tony Alva still skates. I just saw a photo of him grinding
*  a pool. I he's 60 something. Holy shit. But when you fall at 60 something, yeah, that's rugged.
*  Yeah. Well, like, you know, I'm, like I said, I've kind of narrowed down my discipline to the ramp
*  because I know how to fall on a ramp and I wear the pads and that's what's kept me going. But even
*  that, that's why I'm encouraging strength and conditioning. Like when I see people in their
*  fifties that are doing things, I'm like, Ooh, okay. But do you lift weights? Cause you should,
*  you know, really like just kind of fucking trainer, man. Just keep your bone density. That's,
*  that's what's really a real problem when people get older is their, their shit breaks so easy.
*  Right. Things that normally you just bounce off of and be fine. And then all of a sudden you're
*  like, Hey, there's some clicking in my arm. Like, Oh shit, I gotta go to a hospital. And then,
*  you know, a normal fall causes you to have a cast. Yeah. I learned that. Well, I broke my pelvis.
*  Oh, I was almost 40. I was doing a loop ramp, which is something that I had done many times before
*  that. And the loop that we were skating was kind of weathered and kind of slow. And I tried to
*  adjust for that. And I just overshot it. Like I shot out at the top and then just fell straight
*  to the bottom. That's got to affect you. Jamie broke his butt bone out here with a hoverboard
*  and he was fucked up. You were fucked up for like a year, right? Yeah. It came and went. I thought
*  I got fixed. Couldn't get fixed. No one I went to knew what was going on. It took, he had a self
*  identify what the injury was. And then who was it that had a similar injury? Zach Bitter came and
*  said he had the same thing. He got MRIs. The doctor told him he was okay. And then they re looked at
*  it and was like, Hey, by the way, you have a small fracture and like, yeah, and it just like your
*  whole body freezes up. Yeah. I could walk for like 25 yards. I had to stop and sit. Yeah. Loosen up.
*  I had the same thing. You know, those hoverboard things that kids have them out here and they go
*  bananas out here in the warehouse. And yeah, Jamie was fucking around on it while not totally paying
*  attention. I was trying to practice and see if I could film and stuff. And like it, you know,
*  B. Yeah. And we didn't really figure out what it was until Zach Bitter explained it. And then we
*  thought about the, I mean, you're a 200 pound man or whatever you weigh somewhere around there and
*  you fall like on polished concrete on your asshole. Like that's a lot of weight, like butt first. Do
*  you know who Zach Bitter is? I don't. He's the world record holder for a hundred mile race. He
*  ran a hundred miles in 11 hours and like 40 minutes. He's a savage. I mean, just bananas.
*  And then he kept running afterwards. He ran like a hundred miles the long or the fastest to run
*  a hundred miles on a treadmill. Cause he was doing it while he's in quarantine, I think. Oh my God.
*  Wow. And he eats mostly meat. Really? Yeah. His diet is almost all ribeye steaks and he,
*  he supplements it with like some glucose supplements and things like that while he's
*  doing that. He did it again. Zach Bitter shatters a hundred mile treadmill world record. Oh my God.
*  He averages seven minute mile, seven minute, 18 mile for a hundred miles. That's so insane.
*  That's so insane. He's an animal. How old is he? He's in his thirties, right? Jamie? Yeah. 34. Yeah.
*  But just like he was still, he was still running while he had the problem too. Oh yeah. That's
*  just kind of crazy. Yeah. So when I, when I went through that, the thing that I had to adjust
*  mostly was that I didn't realize I was favoring my back foot when I would skate because the
*  fracture of my pelvis was on my front leg or front leg side. And I ended up- Injuring something else.
*  I actually got a KO'd once because I was leaning back more than I should have been. And I thought
*  I was balanced and then found myself just on my back, like KO'd. Oh shit. And then another time
*  I was putting so much weight, like, cause when you, when you skate, you put one foot on the tail of
*  the board. And I was trying to get speed for something going on the big ramp and I had so
*  much force on my tail that I broke it off. Like going through the flat bottom of the ramp, my tail
*  just was left behind me with my foot doing the splits. That's so crazy. And I realized that,
*  that's when I realized that I needed to readjust my weight distribution because of my pelvis and
*  try to figure out how to skate properly again. Wow. Now how do you recover from that? Did you
*  have to go through a rehabilitation? Did you- I basically laid around, sat around for
*  almost two months and then slowly started to walk and then was skating about like six weeks after
*  not walking. And- So you didn't do any rehab? I did some stuff in the pool. I did have, I did
*  have a trainer that was helping me. A guy that I knew that used to work on skate stuff. So he did
*  help me for a few weeks. And then I started skating. It was actually, I was, I was working
*  towards a goal. We had a big exhibition in Orlando that was already booked and I was like, all right,
*  that's, that's the time. How many weeks out was that? I want to say it was, it was about 12 weeks
*  from when I got hurt. Oh wow. That's not a lot of time. Yeah. To recover from a bone break. Yeah. I
*  mean, I, you know, I didn't, it wasn't my best performance, not my best work, but I got through it
*  and then really had to figure out how to rebuild my confidence. That's the thing I lost the most
*  because I started to question everything. I can only imagine. So mostly just laid around,
*  let it heal up and then you had to do something to build your muscle mass. I was doing, I was doing a
*  lot of stuff in the pool with resistance, my leg and stuff like that. That was, that was pretty
*  much it. It was just more, I just felt stiff. And like he said, like when you have an injury like that,
*  you can't cough. Like you know what I mean? You can't like sneezing. If you feel a sneeze coming on,
*  it's, it's traumatic. Right. Cause everything hurts. Yeah. It's about to you're like shot. Yeah. And
*  then like just going to the bathroom is a trauma. Oh God. Right. Just sitting right on the bowl.
*  Oh my Christ. Oh damn dude. Wow. That's amazing though that you, you got through that with pool
*  work, but you could do some great shit in the pool. George St. Pierre is like one of the best UFC
*  fighters of all time. Does the majority of his workouts in the pool. Now he has these things
*  that he wears on his hands, these resistance things. And he does like all these crazy workouts in the
*  pool when he does them on his legs and, and he does like these jumps inside the pool and he does
*  it all to preserve his joints while still, you know, building up muscle. But it's so he's mostly
*  focused on the pool. Yeah. See, see we can find them. They're pretty cool to George St. Pierre,
*  pool workouts. Yeah. He has a, I mean, he's, he's a fascinating guy, really intelligent guy. And
*  he's gone through a bunch of different kinds of strength and conditioning routines and, and, and
*  attitudes about it over his career. And at one point in time he really embraced gymnastics and
*  he got really into gymnastics. But now most of what he does, he goes to the pool and see these
*  things he's wearing. He's got like these like barbell looking things and a bunch of different,
*  different apparatus that he uses. And the, he has, see these things he puts on his legs and he
*  develops his, his kicking power and his jumping power and all these different things with those.
*  That's my ally right there. It's really interesting because you're really not concerned
*  about getting injured this way, but he gets this ferocious muscle workout and he doesn't have to
*  worry about tearing things or, you know, hurting himself because of weight. Yeah. Yeah. All right.
*  Well, you, I'm going to leave here with a whole new attitude. Yeah. Well, it seems like a good
*  thing to try, especially for someone who's funny. That was, that was one of the things that when
*  I told my kids I was coming here, they're like, he's going to talk to you about working out, you
*  know, I was like, I'm sure. And they go, but you don't work out. I've got, I know.
*  F*****g kids, man. They never let you take a break. They ride you if they find this one thing.
*  Oh yeah, of course. Yeah. What about your diet? Are you healthy? Do you eat healthy or?
*  I think so. Yeah. Um, I, uh, what's that? I said that's iffy. Well, I let's put it this way. I,
*  I don't eat to excess like I used to. I think that's really what I've learned getting older is
*  just like, don't go crazy with everything. You know, drinking, eating, like just eat till you're
*  not overly full. Just eat enough and, and watch what I eat. Like for sure, when I was a kid,
*  it was just all, it was all junk food, everything. It was sugar cereals, McDonald's, Jack in the Box.
*  I mean, our, our big going out night with my dad was Bob's big boy. That was like,
*  we were living large. In Burbank? Uh, no, in San Diego. Oh, okay. Yeah. That was it. I mean,
*  without like, I don't, I never went to nice places. The, the, the extent of his nice place was like,
*  hey, this guy, this place has prime rib for five bucks. Okay. Um, so I didn't like,
*  I didn't really grow up with health, health conscious diet. And then as I got older, I,
*  I discovered, well, mostly just so much great food and then realizing that, you know, I gotta
*  get more greens and really watch it. And so, uh, I've managed to be able to do that. I'd say over
*  the last 20 years. Do you take supplements at all? I do. Yeah. What do you take? Yeah, I take, I have
*  a whole bevy of stuff that this nutritionist gave me. Um, I wish I could name them all, but I just
*  know which bottles they are, but it's good and makes you feel better. Definitely. I can tell when
*  I've missed a day or two on them. I mean, just in terms of how I feel. Well, people are so much
*  more conscious of that now. I mean, it's, it's, it's something that pretty much in every athletic
*  pursuit, anything where people are doing things, things physically so much more comp, uh, really
*  conscious of supplements and diet. But I, but I do have to admit that I do love like barbecue.
*  Of course. You know, my wife's not much of a fan. Really? Yeah. What's wrong with her?
*  She's, she eats much more healthy than I do. She's, she's more Mediterranean. Oh, okay. Um, in terms
*  of her diet. Have you ever gone to Dr. Hogley Wogley's in Van Nuys? No. There's a joint in Van Nuys
*  that's been around fucking forever. You go in there, it's like wood panel walls. They've done
*  zero for the decor and no one gives a fuck. There's always a line. It's Spectrum when it's open.
*  Can't even get in right now, but it's some of the best barbecue I've ever had anywhere. And it's in
*  Van Nuys in this semi sketchy neighborhood. Oh, perfect. Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, it's phenomenal.
*  Um, there's a place in San Diego that I've been going called, uh, Abby's, um, that I think is,
*  it's pretty spectacular. That's my daughter loves barbecue too. So that's our big lunch outing.
*  San Diego's got some great food, man. I've been going to San Diego forever. I started going to
*  the La Jolla Comedy Store. Yeah, of course. Way back in the nineties. Yeah. It's a great spot,
*  man. And I might've actually seen you there. That's crazy. San Diego's never gotten too big.
*  You know what I mean? It's still, I try to tell people it's one of the last small beach towns,
*  but it's a city. Right. Well, but if you fan out, especially if you go north,
*  yeah, it's more like no one can really build on the coastline anymore. So, uh, the, the homes
*  that are there there and it's not going to get any more crowded. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah.
*  Well, that's smart because they've, they've preserved a really nice spot. Yeah. It's like
*  the right size. It's like you get traffic there, but it's, I'd stop complaining. It's not shit,
*  you know, come up here. Yeah. This is ridiculous. This place. And even now with the quarantine,
*  it's still, you get on the road. Like, well, I thought everybody's supposed to be home.
*  Right. Stay safe indoors. It's fucking five o'clock traffic. You get like real. I was telling you guys,
*  actually, I was, I was on a, I was on a zoom call just on audio on the way up here.
*  And, uh, I was passing LAX on four or five and usually it's just dead. Stop. Right. And finally,
*  I was just like, Oh man. So I turned the camera on and faced it out. But you guys got to see this.
*  I'm dry. Look at this. There's the one Oh five. There's LAX. I'm still moving. Yeah. It, uh,
*  whenever I've done gigs in San Diego and I have like an eight o'clock show, I'll leave here at
*  11 in the morning. I'm like, there's no way. Oh yeah. Yeah. I've not taken any chances. Yeah.
*  It could easily take five hours. Easily. You know, we sound like that SNL skit, the Californians.
*  Wow. I don't know that skit, but all they do is talk about traffic. Well, it's fucking ridiculous.
*  Have you ever thought about living anywhere else? Um, not really. My wife and I sometimes sort of
*  muse about we'd love to live in New York once all of our kids are out. Um, but probably for a brief
*  time, New York's going to be real weird now. Apparently there's a mass exodus out of there
*  right now. I was there right before everything turned upside down. Oh wow. Um, and it was already
*  feeling shaky. I don't know. They, we went out, we went out to dinner, we saw our friends band
*  perform this little club and there was the sense of unease. What year, what month was this? Uh,
*  that was in early March. Oh yeah. So it was just starting to get there. Or no, no, no, it was in
*  February. Sorry. Oh yeah. But it was like late. It was just, there was something in the air where you
*  knew something was going to change. The buddy of mine caught it there in New York. Yeah, my buddy
*  of mine too, skater, um, my age and he went through hell. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like the New York
*  strain, what they got in the East coast, they were saying is coming from Europe. It's a stronger
*  strain than the strain that they got here in California. It's coming from China. Yeah. Um,
*  my, uh, my oldest son and I were, were extremely sick in February, both like as sick as we've ever
*  been. We are convinced that we had gone through it once everything like, and so I managed to,
*  I managed to get a test. I had to pay through the nose. It wasn't, you know, the tests are not
*  available. Um, but I, I lucked into one and we both didn't have it. Interesting. Yeah. We've been
*  testing pretty much everybody. I didn't test you, but we've been testing everybody that comes here.
*  We just have a concierge service comes here, concierge MDLA or whatever. Oh wow. Yeah. It's
*  nice. How did I luck in luck out? I don't know. I just didn't test you. Didn't ask. I fucked up.
*  It's my mistake. Okay. Well, I was negative as a month ago, as of a month ago. That's good. As long
*  as we don't make out, I think we're okay. Okay. Cool. I was, I've been tested. Uh, I got tested
*  last weekend. I took the swab cause I flew to Florida for the UFC event. So I had the swab
*  before that. I had, uh, um, the antibody tests and then I got it again when it came back all negative.
*  We did have one fighter test positive though. He was asymptomatic and is two cornermen were
*  asymptomatic too, which is one of the weirdest things about this. And he discovered it here.
*  They found out in, oh, he's from Florida, but they found out, uh, when he arrived that, uh,
*  he knew that someone in his family had had it. And so he was cautious and wore gloves and mask
*  and the whole deal and didn't make contact with anybody other than the people that he was with
*  you know, the entire time. And then, uh, they found out before the fight that he was positive.
*  Wow. Yeah. But ever all the other fighters, they did 1100 tests and only three people, uh, were
*  positive and they kind of knew that they had a potential for being positive, even though they
*  were exhibiting no symptoms. It's just wild right now. It's weird. And we, uh, called the event.
*  That was what was really wild. Calling the event with no audience at all. I saw it strange, man.
*  Yeah. Just fucking strange. I'm just happy. Well, I can tell you watching it in home with my kids,
*  they had the same excitement level. Oh, me too. I mean, it was great. The fights were amazing. The
*  judging was fucking terrible. There were some really bad decisions, but the, uh, the fights
*  were incredible. It was just, it was so, it was just great just to do something to be.
*  I was curious about that though. Do you think the fighters had a different sense of energy or
*  motivation because they didn't have the crowd? I don't think the motivation is any different.
*  It might be a little bit less stressful, slightly. Obviously it's a fucking cage fight. It's going to
*  be stressful, but maybe a little less stressful because you don't get the roar of the crowd. It's
*  not the energy in the place. Maybe you could focus a little bit better, but you know, they're in the
*  UFC, so they're fighting the best fighters in the world. So that's no matter what certain mindset
*  you're getting into regardless. Yeah. But it was just interesting because they could clearly hear
*  their corner. So when their corners were yelling out instruction and when the opposition corner
*  was yelling out instructions, they could heal up, hear all that. And we could hear that too,
*  like crystal clear, not a sound in the room. And you could hear the breathing and the impact,
*  the shots way better. It was a lot different. That's a new element. It was a lot different.
*  It's really strange. Yeah. Wow. Are they going to have skating competitions with no audience as well?
*  That remains to be seen. I assume that's probably where it's going to go. I'm not part of the whole
*  Olympic qualifying thing going on, so I don't know what they're going to do or how they're going to
*  continue to qualify people going into next year. We had an event planned that was supposed to happen
*  in June in Salt Lake City, Big Vert Skate Contest, and it has been pushed to August.
*  And I don't know if we can do it with the audience or not. Well, Utah's opening up. I mean, they're
*  doing comedy shows there now. Restaurants are opening up now. They're opening up some things.
*  They're cautiously opening up some things. Yeah. Ultimately, I'm not the one that will decide if it
*  happens or not, but I hope that we can get it done with the necessary guidelines and whatnot,
*  because I do feel like our type of skating, which is the vert skating, is sort of a lost art. That's
*  not going to be in the Olympics, by the way. So is this the first year that skating is going to
*  be in the Olympics? Yeah. Well, next year. But next year. Is it 2021? 2021, yeah. Interesting.
*  So skateboarding, the disciplines are street, which is sort of the handrails and stairs,
*  ledges and stuff like that you see, and then what they call park. And park is sort of a
*  mishmash of pool skating, but also some other skate park elements like banks and curves and
*  things like that. So it's more because that type of skating is more accessible, especially
*  internationally than what we call vert skating. But it's kind of a, to me, it's a disservice to
*  skating because vert skating, like you said, it's the thing you can understand if you're not a
*  skater. People are flying around, they're doing gymnastics, they're doing somersaults, and that
*  type of stuff, you see a very muted version of that in park skating. And why do the Olympics
*  choose those events? I think that's it because the accessibility and then I have to, I have to respect
*  that. That's just nice. For instance, you know, there's a, there's like a strong skate. I mean,
*  there is a skate scene in places like Ethiopia and Ethiopia has parks. They don't have vert ramps,
*  obviously. So I understand on that level, you're going to have a much more well-rounded
*  competitive field. That's cool that Ethiopia is embraced skateboarding. I would like to see that.
*  Yeah, I've been there. You've been there. Yeah. See, here it is. Jamie's already got it. The
*  best in the business. Young Jamie. Look at this. Wow. That's fucking cool. Well, that's not what I
*  picture when I think of Ethiopia. Right. I mean, that looks like that could be Atlanta. That could
*  be anywhere. Yeah, absolutely. Chicago could be any city. And I mean, that kind of thing is happening
*  all over the world. There's a, there's a, I don't know if you've ever heard of skatistan,
*  but skatistan is a skate, for lack of a better word, camp facility and educational facility
*  in Afghanistan, in Kabul. And they teach girls, they teach girls, they give them
*  educations and they learn how to skate. Whoa. In fact, there was a documentary on them that
*  won an Academy Award at the last Oscars. Really? Yeah. Do you got anything on that? That was my in
*  for, it's called Learning to Skate. That's skatistan. It's called Learning to Skate in
*  a War Zone If You're a Girl. That's the name of the documentary. That's got to be very dangerous
*  for them though, right? Because the fundamentalists don't want them doing. Well, so that's the thing
*  is, is that they, they see it, the culture sees skateboards as a toy, not a sport and allows girls
*  to do it. Oh, wow. So they don't, they don't see it as this coed sport at all. And so it's really
*  interesting that the ratio of boys to girls are equal skating in Afghanistan. And same goes for,
*  they have another program in Cambodia and they have one in South Africa. I've been to all of them,
*  not Kabul, but. Look at that picture. That is so wild. The mountains of Afghanistan, the background.
*  Oh yeah. The girls catching air. Their program's insane. They're one of the best. Wow. That's wild.
*  That's crazy. Skating is, that's crazy that during your lifetime, skating has just blossomed and
*  gone from this sort of misfit thing to something that's in the Olympics, in Ethiopia, Afghanistan,
*  all over the world. That's wild. It is wild. Yeah. It's really, every day is like a new surprise.
*  Now, when they do it in the Olympics, what is the scoring criteria? Like how do they, how do they
*  judge? Well, I don't think they're going to reinvent the wheel in terms of how they judge. I think that
*  they have to be very concise with their criteria now in terms of writing it down. Cause before it
*  was just sort of loose and that guy, you know, that skater ripped and went higher and looked
*  cooler and we gave him first and now it's got to be much more. But it's more, it's more about
*  technical aspects, like how the difficulty factor, how you flow, like how you link tricks together,
*  how much speed you have, how high you go. I mean, all those factors. But at the end of the day,
*  when you go to a skate contest, you can tell the top skaters. It's just obvious that they,
*  they were ripping, they use the course better. You know, they went higher, they spun more,
*  they flipped their board hard in more difficult ways and they were the winners. And now do you
*  have former pros or current pros, the judges? I'm not really sure who, how they're picking judges.
*  I'm not like, yeah. A standard competition. How would they? A lot of them were ex pros. Yeah.
*  And so there's pretty like universal acceptance of like what, what's good and what's bad or
*  yeah. I mean, it's always up for debate. Who should have won that event or this or how to
*  imagine at the level that these guys are at, there's probably quite a few guys that are comparable.
*  Right? Sure. Yeah. So it's basically how good your run was, how good your run was. Yeah. And,
*  who had a better day? Similar to surfing in that regard. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what's
*  interesting for someone like me watching. Like I'm not exactly sure what I'm seeing. I know what
*  looks cool, but I don't know what, what, what won, you know? Sure. Yeah. And I, and I think that,
*  well, I, I'm hoping that that will be my job to explain to the audience. Oh, right. I, they,
*  I was supposed to be there in Tokyo doing some commentary, not, not the play by play, but more
*  sort of, you know, coming in and out of, of there and doing whatever shows they need me to do. But
*  I would like to. So did they postpone the Olympics for a year? Is that what they did? For a year. Yeah.
*  So you would like to. I would like to, to be there to try to, to try to bridge that gap. Right. Of
*  the, the non-skating viewer who is interested and explain to them why, you know, why this,
*  this nuance is going to score way higher than this other, even though they look the same
*  to you. Yeah. And I've done it. I've done like, they had the vans park series all last year,
*  where we went to all over the world and went to China, Brazil, Canada, France, and they built
*  these parks that they left there. But I was doing all the, the commentary for the events.
*  And that was kind of where that's where my strengths are is, is being able to explain those things
*  to non-skaters. Well, that's kind of be fun for you too, because there's an opportunity to sort of,
*  you know, proselytize, let everybody know, like, like show them how cool this is. Yeah. Yeah, for
*  sure. Put words to your passion, this thing. And I mean, that's got to really spark up the interests
*  of new skaters. I think that's the silver lining with the Olympics. I mean, there, there is a lot
*  of controversy in the hardcore skate scene where it's just like, we're not, we don't belong in the
*  limit. We've always done this to be anti that type of thing anyway. Yeah. And then it's just like,
*  all those things that you love about skating will still exist. Right. You can still go hop fences
*  and skate the hint. We're like, that's not taken away from you. If anything, it's going to
*  bring it to a bigger audience that is going to be interested. Yeah. And I believe a more
*  international audience. I think that's the really cool part about it. That's a thing though, man,
*  when things start going mainstream, people always panic. Right. But that's the other thing is this,
*  like, if you think that the competition element is what is somehow sanitizing skating, we've had,
*  I grew up skating competitions. I literally entered my first contest at age 10. That is the only way
*  you got recognized when I was a kid. Like this is not something new to skateboarding. It's just that
*  now there are different opportunities in skating and there is a way to make a living. Even if you
*  don't compete. And so because that exists, people are just like, Olympics are a con, you know,
*  that's a sport competition. Like, yeah, but we already have street league and we already have
*  the due tour. We already have X games. Those things all exist. So we're going to have this other big
*  event once every four years. People always want to shit on something that's different than what
*  they're doing though. Oh, sure. It seems like, I mean, hey, I've lived with so much ridicule
*  my whole life that I just, it's like, yeah, sure. Whatever you say. Well, for you, I mean,
*  you've crossed over to the other side. That's what's interesting. I mean, you don't even need
*  a thick skin anymore. Yeah. I mean, there's, there's obviously still haters, like you're a
*  sellout and whatnot, but it's like, do you read those comments? I don't read Twitter or anything,
*  do you? I like, if someone's making enough noise, I'll see it. And, you know, every once in a while,
*  I like to see what the, what the general vibe is on something. But, um, when I grew up, like, I think
*  my journey allowed me to really be prepared for that because when I was a kid, I was doing this
*  outcast activity, right? So I was already not cool in school. And then I started skating and I was
*  like a scrawny little kid with a really sort of what they call robotic style, because I was focusing
*  on tricks. So I was getting made fun of in the skate world. So I was like an outcast in this
*  outcast activity and it was really isolating. And at some point I was like, I love this too much to
*  listen to these people and not do it. Like, explain to me what you were getting shit on for. Like you
*  had a robotic style. So basically when I first started getting into skating, especially pool
*  skating, to be a pool skater, you had to be super cool, look like you're surfing. It was all about
*  your style, right? And it was all about like how you flow. And if you're doing aerials, it's got to
*  look cool. And, and I was super scrawny, super short kid. And so all I really knew how to do was
*  to maneuver my board. And so I was doing these tricks where I'd like spin my board under my feet
*  and do these weird sort of hand plants and aerial tricks and things where it just wasn't,
*  that wasn't the normal and it wasn't really considered the cool way to skate. And so they
*  were like, they call me circus skater. They're like, oh, there's Tony with the circus tricks.
*  Oh, wow. And then at some point I just like, I loved what I was doing and I didn't really listen
*  to it. And then I got more confident and I got stronger. And then I started doing this stuff like
*  way up high in the air. And then it was sort of undeniable that it was like, oh, well,
*  that is something. So was there pressure for you to change your style and sort of blend in?
*  Um, I just didn't have, I didn't have the bulk to be able to do it anyway. So I didn't, yeah,
*  like I just didn't have that weight behind me. And so what I did was when back then in order to do
*  aerials out of pools, you had to like reach down and grab your board and sort of muscle it into the
*  air and above the coping. And I learned how to launch into the air without grabbing my board and
*  then grabbing it at the peak. And that allowed me to get the height when I was still really scrawny
*  and weak. And they said that technique was cheating. Like they literally wrote that in
*  thrash your magazine. It's just like, well, Tony Hawk cheats because he always into his errors.
*  And that way he can just grab it wherever. And I was just like, yes, that's exactly it. That's what
*  I'm trying to do. That's so weird. So they would judge you on that's so crazy. Here's this invented
*  thing, right? This art form. And then you're doing it your way. And they're saying you're cheating.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't, it just, it was just like this old guard in skating and they just, they didn't
*  like to see anything new or, or sort of fringe. And then I started doing that. And then, and then
*  a lot of my peers who were my age, they all figured that same technique out. And then we
*  just kind of took over, you know, that became the way to skate. And, but, but then through the years,
*  like in those days, you know, skating was still very much a novelty. And then in the nineties,
*  like X games came into play. And then all of a sudden my name was, was being well, was well known,
*  not mainstream, but, but getting there. And then our video game came out and then it was just like,
*  oh, you're just a sellout. And it was like, because of the video game, because the video game,
*  the endorsements that followed from that, you know, I was doing stuff for Jeep, for McDonald's,
*  for Doritos. And they were just like, oh, you're just a sellout. I was like,
*  when I turned pro at age 14, if McDonald's had asked me to be in a commercial, I would have
*  jumped on it. Are you kidding me? Like I was eating McDonald's my whole life. I still do.
*  So it was more like they thought someone had changed my values and was just like, I haven't
*  changed my value system. It's just that I'm getting these opportunities finally. And I've
*  been doing this for most of my life. For the most part, it's you're getting opportunities
*  that they're not. So the best way to dismiss that or diminish it is to say that you're a sellout
*  because you're on a video game. Like that's so short-sighted. Sure. But, but, but, but,
*  but so what I'm saying is that just sort of, that sort of steeled my resolve where,
*  so once social media came into play and people were talking shit online, I was like, you're not
*  getting to me through this, you know, through this media. People used to say this to my face,
*  used to write about this, this write about me in magazines. Like you're hiding behind your Twitter
*  username. I don't care. When you first saw someone say that you were cheating by using that technique,
*  how bad that must've sucked up. Yeah. And it was from a, it was from a skater that I really
*  respected too. Like he was quoted in the magazine and that was, it was crushing. Wow. That's such a
*  bitch ass approach. You know, cheating. That's so weird to me because I never would have, I guess
*  it makes sense because there's always factions in any discipline or any art form or anything where
*  some people respect some things and other people shit on it. And, but the idea that you doing it
*  your way would somehow or another be cheating to me, it seems so strange. That doesn't make any
*  sense. Like I said, it was, it was just weird because skating was just a small community at
*  the time. And it was, it was like, why are you like, why are we fighting in our little tiny world?
*  It's always going to be that way. That's just humans. Yeah. Especially when you're doing
*  something different, especially if you're getting attention and doing something different, they're
*  going to find some way to diminish you. Yeah. It was just, it was, it was harder for me because all
*  I wanted to be was accepted as a skater. You know, I kind of given up on my peers and my schoolmates.
*  I knew I wasn't going to fit in there. And so I was like, I found this thing and then just like,
*  you guys don't like me the way I do it rough. But look, you hung in there and came out on the other
*  end. Yeah. And I don't, I don't harbor any ill will. You know what I mean? A lot of people are like,
*  oh, you should go back to school. Like you go to your reunion and I was like, I don't,
*  it's not some revenge for me. I just loved, I'm just so thankful that I still get to do this for
*  a living. Like this is seriously living the dream. Like I get to do this for a living.
*  I get to come on your show because I'm a skateboarder. Like the stuff that I've gotten
*  to do over my life is beyond any dream I could have ever written or imagined. And it's all because
*  I just kept skating. That is the American dream to me or the worldwide dream, the human dream.
*  Absolutely. To be able to do what you want for a living and to continue doing it. Yeah. And to
*  support your family and to, you know, it's crazy. The kind of stuff that we've gotten to do,
*  especially as a family, like the kind of trips we've taken and people we've met for skating.
*  Yeah. For skating. That's crazy. That's amazing. Do you still talk to that guy who shit on you back
*  then? Do you know who that guy is? I do. I think he fell on some hard times. I don't know.
*  That's how it usually goes with haters. Yeah. I'm sorry.
*  Sorry. It's interesting though that there's been these waves of change inside of it during
*  your lifetime. You know, that it's such an evolving sort of growing thing that from the time you were
*  a kid to now, it's almost just a totally different thing, but yet still skating.
*  Still, yeah. I mean, at its core, the feeling I get when I'm on a skateboard is the same.
*  Like when I just go out just practicing on my ramp or in our backyard or whatever,
*  I can just feel that happiness, that sort of peace. And it's the one thing in my life that I'm
*  fully in control of. And that's my escape. That's so cool that you still enjoy it like that.
*  Yeah. I never imagined skating into my thirties.
*  Do you have friends that are your age that also still skate?
*  Yeah. I have a couple of friends that are a couple of years older than me and they're
*  sort of my, you know, they're my gauge. So do you have like a crazy setup in your backyard?
*  I have a small concrete setup that's not huge, but you know, it's fun. And then I have a proper
*  size big vert ramp in my office. And I mean, in the last two months, those are the only places
*  I'm at. Is it an indoor thing, the vert ramp? It's indoor, yeah. How high is it?
*  It is 13 and a half, 14 feet. Wow. So you just go there and fuck around and have fun and...
*  Yeah. Yeah. We've done a couple of live streams from there just to provide entertainment for
*  people. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. And we did one with DJ Z Trip. He was doing like mixing up on the deck
*  and we were doing tricks up on his table. That was pretty cool. And then we are working on this
*  best trick NBD thing. I actually got some money from a sponsor. So, you know, just trying to
*  make content, make entertainment as best we can. What other content do you make online? Do you do
*  podcasts or anything or video? I used to be on SiriusXM. Actually, that was the first time
*  I reached out to you because I had a SiriusXM show for 10 years. And I stopped doing it just because
*  I kind of went as far as I could with getting guests and I just wasn't really moving up the
*  ladder. And it was really hard to maintain that schedule. It was only once a week, but for me,
*  it was like I got a book studio time in LA, drive up here, beg some, I didn't have like,
*  I didn't have anyone running the show. So it was just more like, Hey, does anyone know Seth Rogan?
*  But I had a good run. I mean, I definitely like my last two guests were Pharrell and Seth Rogan.
*  Oh, that's great. So I felt like, all right, that's about it. Pharrell the sports guy? No,
*  Pharrell. Oh, the musician. Pharrell Williams. Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah. Oh, wow. That's, that's a big get.
*  Was. Yeah. So I felt like if, if I'm not, I can't really go further with this idea
*  and let's just end it here. So it was fun though. Do you do anything with it now? Do you do anything
*  like that now? No, not really. I mean, I, I'm happy to, but I just so easy to do some sort of a podcast
*  now. It is. Yeah. I just don't, I guess I just don't want to be that guy that's like, Hey man,
*  do my podcast. Yeah. Cause that's how I felt when I like sent you the first message on Twitter. I was
*  like, Hey, you want to come on serious XM show? And that was right when your show started blowing up
*  and I saw you all. I was like, Oh, he doesn't have time for my show.
*  But I did. I mean, I'm, I'm looking, I'm happy you came to do this. I think what you've done
*  in your life is, uh, it's like a great roadmap for young kids that are sitting out there trying
*  to figure out if they can make a living doing something that they love, you know, that's, that's
*  the roadmap. Oh, for sure. I try to tell people too, you don't have to, you don't have to be the
*  best in your field too, to enjoy it and make a living at it. Like you can maybe find some angle
*  on it that maybe isn't even the thing, but you get, it gets you in the door and you get to be
*  part of the community or the industry and you can live like that, whether it's doing video or art or
*  you know, behind the scenes, you're still part of that scene and it's still super cool. And,
*  and I feel like that's what's lost on kids. They just want to be the best. They want all the
*  stardom and it's just like, Oh, think of something that is, that you would enjoy and make that your
*  job. Because that's for me, that's what success is. That's such an American mindset, that the
*  mindset of I need to be the best. I need to be number one. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And that, that's
*  just the thing that sucks about that mindset is that if you do reach any sense of that, a lot of
*  times that's when it all falls apart. How so? I feel like a lot of people get a taste of it and
*  they're no longer motivated. Do you know what I mean? Okay. I think in a lot of cases I've seen
*  in skateboarding, especially where they just want to be, they want to get in the magazine,
*  they want to be, or win the contest and then they finally do. And they're not motivated to keep it
*  going. That's interesting. Or to, to progress their own skating. So instead of just enjoying it,
*  they, they, in their end, the competition is the end meet the end goal. And then once they hit that
*  competition, it was just a means to an end. And then, and then there's no more inspiration.
*  That's a fun thing. That's a funny thing rather for a lot of people in, in any art form or any
*  sport. They, you know, once they reach a pinnacle, it's very difficult to keep momentum up. That's
*  what happens with a lot of fighters. Oh yeah. They reach the top and then they, they don't have the
*  same enthusiasm they have when they were younger. And then of course the trappings of fame. Oh,
*  and that's another distraction. Another, you know, and some people, that's what they revel in. Yeah.
*  And you can lose sight of, I mean, I think that's what I was lucky that I was young enough and had
*  success. And I saw some of my peers kind of fall into that and I saw how it affected their skating.
*  And that was my signal. It was like, if you follow that road, your skating is going to suffer. And
*  my focus was always getting better at skating. That's interesting. That happens with comedy.
*  A lot of times guys get really famous and then their specials, they start to fall apart. They're
*  like, when they're on the come up, their specials are edgy and they're really into it. They're
*  poor. They're, they're all into it. And then they become famous. And like, that was the thing with
*  Kinnison. Like he's partying with rock stars. Yeah. Hanging out. I saw him during those days.
*  Did you really? Yeah. In San Diego. Oh, wow. Yeah. It was awesome. Yeah. I mean, I got to see him a
*  couple of times. But you could tell that he could just come out and scream and everyone's like,
*  yeah. Oh, so this must've been like 86, 87. Yeah. He, he did a thing where he picked,
*  he called people from the audience to come up and then call their ex-girlfriend. Yeah. I saw that,
*  that set. Yeah. Yeah. That was the thing he was doing. Yeah. I saw him do that at,
*  in Mansfield, Massachusetts. Yeah. But, but in his day, man, he was a genius. Oh, he was the best
*  for, for a couple of years. He's probably the best ever. But then the trappings of fame just got to
*  him. We stopped writing. His brother wrote about it is there's a book called a brother, Sam, his
*  brother, Bill wrote this whole book about this sort of meteoric rise. And one of the things that he
*  said was that, you know, once he became famous, he was like, just doing coke and partying all
*  night. And he really wasn't writing anymore and wasn't out there trying to put together sets.
*  And he definitely wasn't keeping a secret that he was doing it. No, no, he was partying. Well,
*  listen, man, I appreciate you coming in here. It was really cool to meet you. It was my pleasure.
*  Thank you. It was an honor to be here. I think your story is fucking amazing. It's really cool. I love
*  hearing stories like that where someone finds something they love and they just, just follow
*  their dream and they become famous and successful at it. It's just, it's so cool. Yeah. I'm still,
*  still chasing that carrot. Chase that carrot, baby. Thank you. Thanks, brother. Appreciate you, man.
*  Tony Hawk, ladies and gentlemen. Goodbye. Thank you.
