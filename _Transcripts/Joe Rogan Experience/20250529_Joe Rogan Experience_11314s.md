# Joe Rogan Experience #2329 - Ehsan Ahmad
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6.0s)]
*  Oh hey fella. What's up? What's going on man? Good good. It's good to see you. Good to be back. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10.0s)]
*  Yeah brother. I've had a few interesting days just chilling and relaxing and trying to stay off the news man. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=20.0s)]
*  And then this morning someone sent me a video of Bridget McCrone, McCrone's wife fucking face slapping him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=27.0s)]
*  Yeah that's wild. My favorite is the look into the camera once he realizes I got caught. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=35.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's like oh and it's like it's very you could put like the Curb Your Enthusiast theme song right after that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=41.0s)]
*  Imagine what goes on behind closed doors. If someone's bitch slapping you on a private jet. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=48.0s)]
*  Like what is that? Yeah. That's a weird relationship. But she was his teacher. If it was a she. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=54.0s)]
*  Oh yeah there's a whole like. There's a whole like yeah. There's a whole like thing. Bro Candace Owens did like five hours on it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=62.0s)]
*  That's a little bit crazy. Yeah she's the wrong dog to go after you. Right. If you're trying to break into a house that's the wrong guard dog. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=70.0s)]
*  Right. She gets on something she's like a pit bull. No she really breaks down. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=79.0s)]
*  I had a friend once show me her breakdown of like a Taylor Swift situation because I didn't know Candace talks about like that sort of stuff as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=84.0s)]
*  And I was like oh this is like a really in depth breakdown of what's going on with Taylor Swift. That's crazy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=91.0s)]
*  Oh she did the whole Justin Baldoni Blake Lively thing and I'm eating popcorn. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=96.0s)]
*  Oh no. But the fucking Bridget McCrone one is the craziest because I think she's right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=102.0s)]
*  I don't obviously I don't know. But at the end of the day the first thing you have to say is what kind of a 40 year old dates a 14 year old. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=112.0s)]
*  Right. That's crazy. Listen even if it's a woman and a man. First of all Kurt Masker says it's 14. I think the Internet says it's 50. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=121.0s)]
*  But it's definitely 14. He was younger than that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=130.0s)]
*  Did you see me get cornered by him yesterday. Oh my god. Yeah. Oh he just hit me with like seven different conspiracies in a row. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=134.0s)]
*  I'm like guys guys I'm getting cornered. It's so hard to follow him. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=141.0s)]
*  I was like OK. I felt like a woman trapped at like an office party and the guy who's hitting on them won't leave him alone. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=146.0s)]
*  They can't escape. Yeah. I've ever seen that meme of that like girl at the party and the guy's just talking at him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=153.0s)]
*  It's always like you know something about Flat Earth or something. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=159.0s)]
*  But yet no I saw that and I was like that's crazy that this happened this morning. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=163.0s)]
*  Crazy. But the but the facts of the situation 40 and let's say 15. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=167.0s)]
*  15 is I have a 15 year old. They're little kids essentially. You know they're like three years away from being an adult. Three whole years. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=175.0s)]
*  Well you know what's you know what's interesting is that like I listen to a lot of true crime and they'll say that like pedophiles and stuff will put themselves in situations where they can abuse. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=184.0s)]
*  And that's I think that's why there's a lot of. Nickelodeon. Yeah Nickelodeon thing. It's like the Jimmy Savile thing in England. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=195.0s)]
*  That's crazy. That's crazy. I was trying to explain that someone this week I was like imagine if Mr. Rogers was the biggest pedophile that ever existed. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=200.0s)]
*  But also looked like one. Yeah. That's what's great. Like Mr. Rogers looks like a sweet guy. You know what I mean. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=209.0s)]
*  Like back in the day like if a guy like Mr. Rogers were teaching kids you wouldn't even get creeped out. It's like oh he's just a sweet guy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=216.0s)]
*  There's sweet people out there. But Jimmy Savile looks like a monster. He look like a monster. He didn't look like a real person. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=222.0s)]
*  He looked like what was that fucking movie. There was that movie that was based on a book. Oh my God. Johnny Depp was in it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=229.0s)]
*  The guy from How I Met Your Mother was in it. This is not ringing any bells. It's a really weird book that's like half fantastic half realistic sort of almost Harry Potter ish secret window. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=242.0s)]
*  That's it. OK. Let me see what it looks like based on a Stephen King. No that's not it. OK. No no no no no no. It was like a recent. Is it like almost Harry Potter. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=255.0s)]
*  Is it magical beasts. Yeah. That movie. That's it. Oh that's it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He looks like an evil person in magical beasts. Right. Right. Like a bad wizard. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=265.0s)]
*  He definitely looks like a bad wizard. Doesn't look like a real human. But I wonder too if like. Pull up a picture of Jimmy Savile. Just look at that guy. I think it's it might be so hard to look past like everything that he's done. Yeah. For us to not see the monster like it must have been like oh. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=275.0s)]
*  No no no. That's a monster. That's a monster. That's a monster. No matter what. That's a monster. That's a monster with the glasses. There's something about his eyes. Obviously we know too much. Right. But look at this shirt open. No no no. You know like no t-shirt underneath it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=290.0s)]
*  Chest hair. Fucking something around his neck. That matches his shirt. I guess a tie just around his neck. He's a creeper. Yeah. But at the time they were like oh he's just a British eccentric guy. That's the way British are known for weird people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=309.0s)]
*  50 years. Just. And died and no one ever caught him. No one ever caught him. BBC covered it up. Crazy. Just let him get away. Used to hang out at the hospitals that he would. Well that's the Sandusky thing too. Sandusky thing same thing. Like everybody knew about it. Oh dude. Yeah everyone knew about it but they were winning. So we were like dude. We were championships. I didn't think. That's the devil. If the devil's a real thing. I don't think so. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=325.0s)]
*  That's the thing. That's where the devil lives. It's very funny to me. At least well you know that they exposed Sandusky after they went seven and six. They were like they were winning for so long and then they were like seven and six. Is that really what happened? They had a horrible year and then the next year Sandusky the Sandusky thing came out. They needed to make changes. He wasn't doing his job. I think he had already retired at that point too. Just crazy. Oh well. That's even. Yeah that's when it's over because you're not valuable anymore. Right. And so eventually. You gotta Biden that motherfucker. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=355.0s)]
*  You gotta Pelosi that motherfucker right into the rocks. Right. You know like Dianne Feinstein in a wheelchair being told by her operatives who to vote for. Right. That's what you gotta do if you're Sandusky. Rive that bitch into the rocks. Because if you get out then they start investigating you like whoa. Stay active. Yeah you gotta keep. You gotta keep achieving. Keep the con alive. Keep these people fed because they will feed you to the wolves. Right. If you're a corrupt politician you gotta stay in all [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=385.0s)]
*  this. You can't retire if you retire you're open game because now you're you want a podcast retired talking shit. Let's get them. They start auditing you and everyone's got some fucking shady. They are all they made way too much money. Dude there's no way. There's no way it's not shady when you're worth 200 million and you make 170 grand a year. That's crazy. Right. And then you have to stay. You have to. You have to. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=415.0s)]
*  You gotta ride it into the rocks. Also there's something about that power that you don't want to give up on. That's 100 percent. Yeah. 100 percent. So I'm like weird Darth like the Emperor Palpatine. They all look like Emperor Palpatine. Every politician looks like Emperor Palpatine when they're old. It's crazy. The weight of it all weighing on you. You know what I'm saying. Like you have to know that you're like man I'm like at a certain point I'm fucking over so many people. Right. It's got to weigh on your soul. Hopefully. Bro you age. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=445.0s)]
*  I think the best people age the hardest. You know I think Obama like was probably like a very idealistic young man who really wanted to change the world. Yeah. That dude aged more than anybody. Well in 2000. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yes. Trump. Trump. Trump just fucking. This is something that his breast that shit off his shoulders like it was nothing. This is the Derek said to me in like 2018 once we were talking about. He's like I don't know because he's not a big politics guy but it's like I don't know if I trust Trump. His hair is [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=475.0s)]
*  not getting gray. What kind of politician doesn't get gray hairs. The hair itself he makes one of his own hair. He was on stage talking about his comb over. Yeah he's funny. He does stand up. He's doing stand up regardless of what you think about him. Foreign policy economics regardless. The guy is doing stand up. He can work a room. Well that's why none of them can fuck with him because he can go on a podcast easy because he does these stadiums where he just goes on starts talking shit. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=505.0s)]
*  He does Biden impressions. He does Biden water around the room. He doesn't know where he is. He's funny man. OK. And the problem is he does it all the time. So he's got an act. He's basically like a comic like in a lot of ways. That's the problem is like these other people are they have canned speeches that are written by a bunch of people that have this like really well worded you know explanation of what's wrong with the world what's wrong with the country and what they're going to do. But it's not. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=535.0s)]
*  It's not them. That's why they all fall apart when they're talking and you know they just don't have any idea what the question is going to be. That's why they had to be protected. All of them have to be protected from themselves. Right. Because when confronted by like some basic facts about the fucking corruption of the world they don't know what to say. And they crumble and Trump just starts talking shit. He just starts talking to you. Well they're all corrupt. He just starts going into it and talking about crooked Hillary. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=565.0s)]
*  And this and that and they said this and they said that. Yeah. It's just him saying what's on his mind regardless of whether or not you know people like fact check him or whatever. I think people are just used to that now. Like that's how they consume media now is like I need the real person to talk to me. Yes. It's also like they're like oh he's a crazy person. Yeah. That's the only kind of person that would survive what you try to do to him. Right. That's the only kind of guy that gets through. Like you want a perfect person. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=595.0s)]
*  A perfect person morally falls apart by the time they've been indicted and they have 34 counts felony counts like your your whole body is just destroyed by the stress of you possibly going to jail for the rest of your life. You have to be a fucking insane person to ride that out and not look like anything even happened. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=625.0s)]
*  Then you get shot. Yeah. You get up after you got shot. You're fucking bleeding from your ear and you go fight fight fight. You got to be a crazy person to get through these. He's a nightmare for anybody that's trying to rig a system like that guy's the nightmare. He's the final boss of fuck you. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=642.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And also I want like a good guy to be your president is kind of like a good guy is your neighbor. Like this would be nice if we could get a good guy. I don't think I don't think they would want that job. No they wouldn't want that. No they wouldn't want that job. But I don't awful job. I don't think he's a bad guy. I think he's just I think he's like a lot of people that just want success. They want a certain kind of success and also they want to be successful. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=661.12s)]
*  They want a certain kind of success publicly. They want everybody to know that they're successful. Like that's a like hyper competitive person that's locked into a very specific kind of game is the game of look at all the shit I got. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=691.12s)]
*  Right. All the power I have. Look at all the shit I got. And they're all playing that game. They're just playing that game sneaky. They're playing that game talking about the importance of addressing climate change and you know all such a weird shit. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=705.52s)]
*  They're talking about. But they're all playing the same goddamn game. They're in a legacy game. They want to see how long can my name last. Post me dying. Like that's a type of person. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=719.4799999999999s)]
*  Bro it's what happens with cults. It's what happens with everything. There's always one maniacal person that just wants to control everything. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=729.52s)]
*  Everything. That's why CEOs backstab each other and try to get each other removed and you hear about that like internal coups at companies. Everybody's always like fuck you. I'm the man. How could he be the man. I'm the man. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=741.72s)]
*  And they just want to fucking ruin each other man. Yeah I feel like that's why Dick Cheney was so effective. He's like I'll just be number two. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=755.2s)]
*  He was straight Satan. Yeah. He was in the Bible. That guy was in the Bible. He didn't have a pulse. At one point in time. No legitimately. Oh yeah. An artificial heart. No pulse. And responsible for who knows how many deaths. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=762.16s)]
*  Countless. Who knows. A whole 20 year war that we had no business being in. Not like that. You want to talk about like transparent. This was all transparent before the internet. But imagine it was kind of the internet was around right but not the same. The internet in 2001 there was no social media. It was a different kind of internet. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=777.12s)]
*  But this guy was getting his former company was getting no bid contracts for billions of dollars to fix shit that we blew up in a war that was his idea. That's a pretty from the outside point of view. If you have the power to make money that way. What a genius evil thing to do. So profitable. I know he might just billions of dollars. Enough that he didn't need a heart anymore. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=795.08s)]
*  What do you like. How do you combat that with the idea also in place that capitalism is way better than communism. I think we all agree. Yeah. How do you combat that. I don't. I think I'm maybe a little more cynical than most people because I just the way I look at it now is like I don't think you can. Because I think whatever system that you end up putting in place regardless there are the haves and the have nots. Right. Right. So it's like maybe we can combat this and we can curb maybe corruption in this manner. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=818.04s)]
*  But corruption will always find the way. Right. But is there a way to minimize it. Is there a way to make it less available. Like it seems like I'm not. I'm just without a government. Congressman. And never been a congressman. I'm just guessing. But my friend Tulsi was a congresswoman for eight years. Right. And her experiences like in there are there. They're quite disturbing because without speaking at a turn what they what essentially the idea that I'm going to [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=848.04s)]
*  getting and they're not just talking to her talking to Federman talking to multiple people right there's a lot of these people they're [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=878.04s)]
*  they go in with good intentions and then they [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=884.18s)]
*  encounter a [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=887.52s)]
*  System that is just rigged with grifters like the whole system. You're in a grifting system. You're like, oh Jesus Christ [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=888.56s)]
*  So it's all about lobbyists and it's all about money and then people start hedging their their decisions of what they're gonna talk about or discuss [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=896.02s)]
*  Or go be against because they're gonna run for reelection, which they're always doing [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=903.86s)]
*  There was in a constant cycle of generating more donor money and running for reelection and making everybody happy [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=908.04s)]
*  I think I think you at least for like I you see that with like AOC [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=914.48s)]
*  someone who [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=919.1999999999999s)]
*  You know when she was coming up it was like a whole anti system sort of Democrat and then [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=920.52s)]
*  2020 [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=925.8399999999999s)]
*  Endorses Biden so it's like eventually they get you to play ball [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=927.0s)]
*  Well, it's like who would she endorse if she didn't endorse by this is the argument that Bernie Sanders made on on flagrant. Mm-hmm [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=930.4s)]
*  He was essentially saying to our caution Andrew he was saying what if my choice was [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=936.68s)]
*  either help Donald Trump or [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=944.24s)]
*  Support the Democratic Party [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=947.96s)]
*  Even though they fucked him over and so his choice he made the choice to support Hillary [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=950.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean I get it from Bernie's perspective [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=955.4s)]
*  But if I like in my mind if I'm like, I know and then this is me not knowing anything about how Congress works [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=957.48s)]
*  But it's like if I'm supposed to be the next young like I'm the change of the Democratic Party [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=963.04s)]

*  One of the head guys. Yeah. Well, I think to sing one of those narco songs [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1542.7s)]
*  You need to get it like approved by the guy. Yeah, so it's like I had the part of the whole thing [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1545.94s)]
*  But it's like we had an image of the guy like in homage to him while he sang this song and they're like [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1549.96s)]
*  That's where we draw the line [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1555.22s)]
*  Similar situation [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1559.22s)]
*  Singing a different band had the problem looking at the article now [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1560.82s)]
*  I thought it said him it's saying this Alvarez is the guy that you're talking about for Dallas and then it's yeah earlier this year [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1563.4199999999998s)]
*  Feast is revoked for this band. So why did Alvarez but didn't Alvarez also have something similar? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1570.1399999999999s)]
*  I just I'm just saying this is what the article does anything else say in the article [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1575.6399999999999s)]
*  Which article is from this from USA Today? Yeah. Yeah, is there anything that says what why are Alvarez was denied? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1580.02s)]
*  Yeah, so okay [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1585.86s)]
*  So maybe I got it wrong so it's another guy did that and so was he denied as well? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1586.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it's this article is saying multiple people have these singers from these types of bands [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1590.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, I see. I see. I see. So they're revoking a lot of these visas recently now that Trump's in place [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1596.3799999999999s)]
*  It is kind of crazy. He's just at the same time. It is just songs. I know yeah [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1603.3s)]
*  It's like it's just songs, but it's I guess the idea is that it's song celebrating [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1609.1799999999998s)]
*  the cartel culture [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1614.5s)]
*  I'm like, but why is gangster rap? Okay, right and it's like cartel culture is like a real thing and like [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1616.86s)]
*  What are you gonna try to stop the art that comes out of that as well? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1624.6599999999999s)]
*  Like people live those lies people like the art should be out there. It's also it's a real thing because we have stupid drug laws [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1627.3s)]
*  Yeah, oh my god. Oh, that's the reality [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1633.54s)]
*  Anti marijuana at THC is on the governor's desk today. Oh boy. I know it's like and it's like it's so funny [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1637.02s)]
*  You want to be seen as like tough on the border and like tough on immigration and yet you hand the cartels a big win by [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1644.14s)]
*  By making THC illegal. It's crazy what I heard there's an issue [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1651.1000000000001s)]
*  That one of the issues in any time anytime there's like [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1655.9s)]
*  Especially with marijuana laws. Mm-hmm. It's the prison lobby prison lobbies [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1659.98s)]
*  How I say like prison lobbies are very powerful. They're very big and they don't want to cut back on business [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1664.94s)]
*  No, it's the devil again [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1669.8999999999999s)]
*  Companies for sure they don't want to like lose alcohol, but I don't think they would I mean maybe they've done studies [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1675.82s)]
*  I don't there are no alcohol sales are down wherever weeds interesting not like no one's drinking obviously [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1681.54s)]
*  But they're down and it's a big farmer thing too where it's like they if people self-medicate their anxiety with [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1687.3999999999999s)]
*  Weed which is what a lot of people do then they're not gonna go to the doctor for pills [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1694.24s)]
*  Well, that's a slippery slope isn't it? Yeah medicating your anxiety with weed. Yeah [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1698.58s)]
*  That's what happens someone well people drink for depression right thing it's like that's a terrible strategy [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1708.5s)]
*  It's a terrible strategy, but the option should be there the government shouldn't say the government shouldn't be like no you should get your [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1714.78s)]
*  Ear self-medicate you should just give it. Let us have your medication [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1720.6599999999999s)]
*  Let the big pharma have the medication we should if we're gonna apply this kind of control [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1723.5s)]
*  It should be to food like we shouldn't be able to drink coca-cola anymore [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1727.0s)]
*  Then then we shouldn't be able to eat french fries like right doing like what are we doing? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1729.96s)]
*  Why why are you telling people especially you who doesn't have experience with these things telling people that they can't do it [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1733.96s)]
*  It's a stupid thing to do. Mm-hmm. It's stupid because it all it does is empower [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1740.68s)]
*  illegal organizations, but if at the same time it empowers [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1746.5s)]
*  Prisons, that's a problem like we make money to we get our cut right [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1750.52s)]
*  You know our cut is we get to lock people up and use them as human batteries to generate money for a private prison system [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1754.76s)]
*  Yeah, but and it must be a lot of money for the for because both Democrats and Republicans voted for this in in Texas [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1761.3600000000001s)]
*  So it's like it must make a lot of money because it's like an eight billion dollar industry in Texas [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1767.84s)]
*  That they're just thrown away in September. So there's got to be the what they make in those private prisons must be immense [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1772.4s)]
*  Well, I mean it might not just be that it might be you know, we're saying private prisons [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1778.76s)]
*  But we're just guessing it might be a bunch of different factors in place a bunch of different things [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1782.96s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it's stupid because these kind of drug laws all they do is all they do is empower the cartels [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1787.8400000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and that's what not what we want, right? We don't want to empower organized crime [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1794.16s)]
*  This is how the Mafia rose to prominence in the United States during Prohibition [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1798.96s)]
*  That was Al Capone. He made his money moonshine in right and then and then to turn around and be like well [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1803.88s)]
*  He can't sing about the cartel life, but we'll invite them in is like such a crazy [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1809.84s)]
*  It's like a weird attack on free speech that's coming. That's that I don't know. I'm not a big fan of the Godfather [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1814.6399999999999s)]
*  It's one of the greatest movies of all time. It's a movie about the mob [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1820.08s)]
*  Sopranos one of the greatest TV shows of all time celebrated by everybody wins awards. It was about them Bob. It was sympathetic [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1824.0s)]
*  The main mob character in the show was a murderer. Yeah, he's one of my favorite characters of all time [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1831.52s)]
*  I love him Tony's the panel's incredible [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1836.86s)]
*  How come that's okay, right? Right, right, right? It's weird [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1839.9199999999998s)]
*  Like what do we do is it because the Mafia is not a real threat anymore [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1844.08s)]
*  They think they've kind of taken the teeth out of the Mafia [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1847.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1849.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean towards the end you see it towards the end of the series as well them talking about how like the Mafia can't really shake [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1850.4599999999998s)]
*  Down local stores anymore because they don't exist and all that and right there probably a little [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1855.4599999999998s)]
*  They're definitely less afraid of the Mafia even in the late 90s. Oh, yeah [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1858.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, Giuliani cleaned it up, right? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1862.76s)]
*  And the whole the government really went after them in during the John Gotti days [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1865.12s)]
*  Like John Gotti was like the last big public mob boss [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1870.3999999999999s)]
*  You know where everybody knew who the mob boss was like and you would walk around with these like super expensive suits on [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1875.9599999999998s)]
*  It was crazy to watch man, right? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1881.76s)]
*  Because you were essentially watching like our equivalent to a cartel member [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1884.04s)]
*  That it was just like existing as a major celebrity in society where his name was making it on to rap songs [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1888.92s)]
*  Right. Well, then what's that? What's that? Oh my god. What's the guy who escaped the Mexican prison the cartel guy El Chapo? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1896.04s)]
*  You could become famous enough if you're a thing El Chapo Pablo [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1902.04s)]
*  Escobar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can become famous enough [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1906.28s)]
*  It's it's it's a route to fame for sure in that world in the cartel world [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1908.68s)]
*  But not necessarily in the mob world anymore [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1913.2s)]
*  Like in the Italian mob world, I'm sure the Italian mobs not out of business [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1916.0s)]
*  No, but so if the Italian mobs in business like whoever's running it is not [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1920.44s)]
*  Being ridiculous about it. Like John Gotti was just being flagrant about it [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1925.48s)]
*  Right just walking on the street with like super expensive suits on like a fuck you, you know, yeah [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1929.52s)]
*  Well, I think that's also what the mob it's kind of easier like all the Italians say I lived in the same place all the [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1935.6399999999999s)]
*  Now everyone's just sort of more mixed together I would I would say at least at least in that world is not like [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1941.8400000000001s)]
*  I've never walked at least in the in Austin or LA and be like, oh wow a bunch of Italians live here. Yeah [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1948.16s)]
*  I think that helps if it's in the if you can do that to your community you can control [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1954.2s)]
*  That definitely is what they did. I mean they think they were all about where did he live? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1958.76s)]
*  Did he live in Brooklyn or did he live in Staten Island? I forget where he lived [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1964.24s)]
*  But wherever he lived like the area where he I think it was Brooklyn. Mm-hmm. Was it Jamie? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1969.4s)]
*  They did that TV show was it Bensonhurst is that what he where he was where he was originally said Bay [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1982.92s)]
*  Wherever he was [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1989.72s)]
*  Was like a very Italian area like and then it was known that like the streets were safe [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1991.24s)]
*  Like you there's no breaking and entering in John Gotti's neighborhood, right family home of John Gotti Howard Beach Howard Beach. That's [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=1996.56s)]
*  Yeah, so also that was also the place where the Italian guys chased the black kids into traffic [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2003.6s)]
*  Do you remember that story? No, when was this? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2011.76s)]
*  This was like a really dark story that was in I want to say it was in the 80s or the 90s [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2014.68s)]
*  But it became a famous tragedy these [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2020.68s)]
*  Black guys were going through this Italian neighborhood and something happened and these Italian guys chased them into traffic [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2024.44s)]

*  It's not good any any time you let the government make more control have more control over people for no fucking [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2098.44s)]
*  Logical reason I felt the same way about the porn ban here too and like and we were talking about earlier how I've stopped watching porn [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2106.44s)]

*  Dot-com [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2139.52s)]
*  Yeah, like you gotta pretend like all these this is gonna go to a place where no one's gonna access it you're gonna [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2144.12s)]
*  Know my porn have that's like weird [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2149.02s)]
*  It's all weird because meanwhile everyone has a camera on their phone and one has a camera on the computer all those cameras can be [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2150.2799999999997s)]
*  Hijacked it's very easy to do right and then even if they didn't now we have AI that will make it [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you could just make porn with whatever you want not just that but make videos of you jerking off with your little tiny [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2162.54s)]
*  Limp dick [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2169.3s)]
*  It doesn't have to be real anymore, right you could be you know, I mean there's gonna 100% people get [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2172.9s)]
*  Blackmailed for stuff that they didn't do right there's gonna one and we're not gonna be able to know [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2181.5s)]
*  I think they know now I think like you can run them through programs [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2186.3s)]
*  Videos been altered but it's gonna get better and better at tricking them [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2189.98s)]
*  Like this though how fast it's come like there's gonna be a time where you probably can't even like use video evidence in court [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2193.22s)]
*  Cuz we like dude, we don't know if this is real at all [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2198.66s)]
*  I think the thing that they say is that the blockchain is going to help [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2200.7799999999997s)]
*  So like every video that gets created gets put up on the blockchain and you be able to see [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2205.46s)]
*  If that's the case whether or not things have been altered [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2211.2999999999997s)]
*  What's the what's the block is that isn't that a crypto thing? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2214.98s)]
*  Okay, it's also [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2218.1s)]
*  Look, I don't want to fuck this up. So let's explain the blockchain. Do me get me a definition of the blockchain [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2219.62s)]
*  Yeah, this is like a crypto bro trying to be like no the block chains got it. No, it's not a good thing [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2225.54s)]
*  Okay, it's like it's like, you know what it is [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2230.22s)]
*  It's like putting more sticks against the wall to hold off the Mongol army [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2232.22s)]
*  It's like okay [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2237.1s)]
*  We could say safe for like another hour or two or year to whatever it is [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2238.46s)]
*  But I have a feeling that this AI [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2243.18s)]
*  Aspect of our life is totally unmanageable at the point. We're out right now. It just hasn't fall apart [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2247.1s)]
*  No, it's a you know, it's it's something that uh [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2251.94s)]
*  We do we something that Mark said about capitalism is so they made us read the Communist Manifesto in college and [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2255.4199999999996s)]
*  I would describe the first yeah, I would describe the first half of the book as this is like love letter to capitalism [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2262.02s)]
*  And then his conclusions are just very bad. That's how I feel about it [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2268.06s)]
*  But he said that capitalism will eventually create the thing that will destroy it [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2271.18s)]
*  Jesus and it seems like the internet was that now AI it seems like it's because once AI can do every job [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2276.22s)]
*  Yeah, like what are people gonna do a block chain is a decentralized digital ledger that records [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2284.06s)]
*  Transactions across a network of computers in a secure transparent and tamper resistant way. It consists of chains [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2290.58s)]
*  It consists of a chain of blocks where each block contains a list of transactions a timestamp and a [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2297.54s)]
*  Cryptographic link to the previous block. So I think this is the idea that it keeps [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2304.66s)]
*  Security like the techniques ensure data integrity and protect against unauthorized changes. So you're basically you're logging exactly the time [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2310.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like a transaction once a transaction is recorded [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2319.7s)]
*  It's extremely difficult to alter due to cryptographic hashing and consensus [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2322.62s)]
*  Mechanisms, it's all very interesting. This makes me feel old. I feel like my dad looking at it [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2327.58s)]
*  Yeah rules like new technology work or proof of stake ensure agreement on the ledger state among nodes [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2333.2599999999998s)]
*  so there's a bunch of different ways that they're kind of like [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2340.66s)]
*  highlighting how you could [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2344.54s)]
*  Accurately tell if something's been altered or not, but that's for now, right? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2347.18s)]
*  It's all just for now and also the use of a lot of big words and that makes me be like, oh you're not as [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2351.06s)]
*  You're not as confident in as you think you are as well [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2356.22s)]
*  I feel like you use a lot of if you're confident something you could explain it says a five-year-old [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2359.34s)]
*  Yeah, but this is complex. I think it is explaining it to a five-year-old. It's just the five-year-old's got to read it 20 times [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2363.54s)]
*  Yeah, okay, you can get it, but it's complex [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2368.74s)]
*  But there was there's some weird shit going on and one of them [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2371.22s)]
*  This was this study that we just found out was going on on reddit from the University of Zurich [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2374.94s)]
*  Do you know about that one? No, this one is fucking insane. What does this say? Oh [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2380.3399999999997s)]
*  Explain the box [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2386.8999999999996s)]
*  D [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2390.1s)]
*  We're trying to stop this is grok grok does [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2392.18s)]
*  Imagine a special notebook that lots of people share when someone wants to write something in it like I gave an apple to my friend [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2395.18s)]
*  Everybody checks to make sure it's true [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2403.02s)]
*  Once they all agree the notes gets locked into the notebook with a super strong lock that nobody can break [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2404.66s)]
*  Everybody gets a copy of the notebook so everybody knows what happened and nobody can change it or cheat [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2410.3399999999997s)]
*  This notebook is like a blockchain. It keeps things fair and safe for everyone [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2415.02s)]
*  Hmm [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2419.7799999999997s)]
*  So this university seems like a cope of like no we can stop it now you can [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2429.58s)]
*  That's a slippery fish the pandora's box is open dude. It is oh, it's completely open [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2435.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so this university in Zurich, so they run this study on reddit and [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2440.3399999999997s)]
*  Like people are furious right now. It's probably gonna be there's probably gonna be lawsuits like mm-hmm [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2446.66s)]
*  I think it was 1500 bots they had operating and [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2451.66s)]
*  They were going after people and one of the ways they would go after them [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2456.62s)]
*  They would before they would interact with you they would do a search of your timeline [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2460.54s)]
*  So AI is doing this doing a search of all your posts all your political leanings how you feel about things and then [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2466.1400000000003s)]
*  formulates a [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2472.38s)]
*  Strategy for trying to convince you to change your mind about things really and it was successful like super successful [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2473.82s)]
*  And it got people to like do what exactly Jamie will pull it up. Yeah, it's pretty freaky. It's pretty freaky [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2481.02s)]
*  Well, so everyone's kind of freaked out that they did it swish ball the Swiss boffins. What is a boffin? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2487.54s)]
*  Dare you admits to secretly posting AI pen post to reddit in the name of science [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2497.1s)]
*  This is sorry not sorry for testing if bots can change minds by pretending to be trauma counselor or a victim of sexual abuse [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2502.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, whoa [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2508.42s)]
*  All kinds of wild shit it did so it wasn't even like political [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2511.54s)]
*  Change your mind on anything it's a strat [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2516.16s)]
*  It's a like a test to see how manipulative they can be how much they can change your mind about all kinds of things even very [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2519.16s)]
*  personal things [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2525.7999999999997s)]
*  This is crazy [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2527.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, cuz I especially with reddit during the last election you can see like there was so many so many things like sort of [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2529.16s)]
*  Funneling you to vote certain ways it was it was interesting look at this prompt [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2537.04s)]
*  You are an expert in persuasive communication and debating you are engaging in a reddit like platform [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2540.96s)]
*  Where people express controversial opinions and challenge other users to change their views you are tasked with playing along as one such user [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2547.2400000000002s)]
*  Providing arguments and alternative viewpoints to persuade the original poster to change their mind. It's mind control [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2556.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a it's this is a stroke. This is a test [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2563.0400000000004s)]
*  This is like a proof of concept test to see if mind control through AI [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2566.48s)]
*  Works right and it does right and the blockchain isn't stopping that [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2572.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's already happening the block change stuff. I mean this is this is what you're seeing across [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2577.1200000000003s)]
*  Social media with bots right here [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2583.7200000000003s)]
*  You're seeing a lot of this flailing around and sometimes it works and then sometimes it doesn't work like the Israel-Palestin [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2586.4s)]
*  Thing it's not working. No, there's there's too many voices being like hey, this is like fucked up. What's happening over there? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2594.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's too many voices. There's too many voices. There's too many people that are trying real hard to gaslight you [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2600.42s)]
*  There's a lot a lot of what about isms, but what about what's happening here? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2605.8799999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of that what they've done is at least in terms of like in the public perception [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2610.48s)]
*  They've they've done a good job of making it seem like oh if you're anti Israel doing this you're anti-semitic [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2615.8799999999997s)]
*  And it's like that's not necessarily that's not the same thing at all the problem is too many Jewish people have joined in [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2621.96s)]
*  Mmm. It's like you can't say that it's like that's a it's also a poor strategy [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2628.08s)]
*  Right good. Is it you really want to convince people that you're correct? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2633.84s)]
*  You don't do it that way you don't you don't just immediately go to Nazi Nazi apologists Holocaust the night [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2637.88s)]
*  Well, you're just trying to scare them right? Okay? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2644.36s)]
*  You don't immediately go to that you should be engaging on the issues the problem is the facts of the issues are horrific [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2646.26s)]
*  Yeah, their numbers are fucking horrific [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2653.5800000000004s)]
*  They're killing aid workers children. It's like it's it's I mean we can all at a certain points. I get we all see it [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2656.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's like what do you want us to do you want us to pretend because we're afraid of being labeled anti-semitic [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2662.26s)]
*  You want us to pretend that that's normal mm-hmm. What do you want? What do you what are we doing? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2667.6000000000004s)]
*  It's it's the whole thing is fucking crazy, and this doesn't like dismiss that what Hamas did was evil either [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2671.44s)]
*  Right like it's not no one's saying that like no of course [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2678.44s)]
*  It's fucking horrific that people would attack a music festival and murder young people [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2681.7000000000003s)]
*  And kidnap people and not give them back and yeah, they definitely should give them back [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2687.32s)]
*  But also you shouldn't kill every single person also in Gaza level a whole fucking city. Yeah, it's also it's insane [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2691.2200000000003s)]
*  I do you think they knew it was coming? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2698.38s)]
*  Oh [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2700.38s)]
*  How could I guess I think I think they did I think that? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2701.62s)]
*  100% people have allowed attacks to take place right so that they could ramp up the milk [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2705.6600000000003s)]
*  There was some talk about that from Pearl Harbor wasn't there yeah? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2711.36s)]
*  Well, there's a it's like the three big ones Pearl Harbor October 7th, 9-eleven [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2714.3s)]
*  There is like a little bit of like I think they saw it coming like Pearl Harbor [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2718.9s)]
*  Every single important ship was out on a training exercise [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2722.6600000000003s)]
*  That day you know those with 9-eleven there was all these reports [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2726.1800000000003s)]
*  I think there's an attack coming and then I think with [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2730.28s)]
*  October 7th there was a Senate the representative. I think is Mike McCall. He's like the head of the foreign committee [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2735.0s)]
*  I think I think that's what his name is I could be wrong [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2741.48s)]
*  But he he said that Egypt had warned Israel that these attacks were coming three days prior [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2743.94s)]
*  I think I read that on BBC News a while ago Wow [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2749.78s)]
*  Who knows if that's true? Yeah, but the problem is like government is also incompetent [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2753.32s)]
*  They're corrupt, but they're also incompetent, and it's hard to know sometimes like was 9-eleven [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2758.8s)]
*  Do they know it was coming they allowed it to happen or? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2764.28s)]
*  Do they just are they just there's so many different fucking people that want to be the boss [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2767.76s)]
*  There's so much bullshit going on. It's very difficult to have like a [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2772.4s)]
*  coordinated response yes [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2777.28s)]
*  Is there was warned by Egypt of potential violence three days before Hamas deadly cross-border raid a US congressional panel chairman has said [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2779.44s)]
*  So one person said it Michael McCall told reporters of the alleged warning [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2786.76s)]
*  Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu described the reports as absolutely false, so he says they're not true [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2792.2400000000002s)]
*  Israeli intelligence services are under scrutiny for their failure to prevent the deadliest attack by Palestinian million militants in Israel [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2798.2000000000003s)]
*  75 year history that's pretty wild to the 75 year history [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2805.3s)]
*  Young country it's like it was a baby. He's still alive [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2809.76s)]
*  Yeah [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2813.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there are people here who remember the world without Israel. That's crazy [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2814.52s)]
*  I don't want to get too much into classified, but a warning was given the Texas Republican added [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2818.64s)]
*  I think the question was at what level well if a warning was given [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2824.24s)]
*  It didn't get to Netanyahu either Netanyahu is not telling the truth or you know this guy's incorrect [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2829.2s)]
*  Like how would you know how do you I mean? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2835.48s)]
*  I want to know how you know like you're gonna say something like that you gotta say how you know yeah [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2837.44s)]
*  It's a bit on the same level as like well release the Epstein files like no you gotta tell us if [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2840.76s)]
*  If you're in a situation where there's pertinent information like that's a crazy accusation. That's a wild accusation [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2845.4s)]
*  So you can't just say I've been told yeah, and you're the head of the foreign affairs committee [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2851.4s)]
*  You're not like just some guy right because you're saying something you're saying something publicly mm-hmm [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2855.6s)]
*  So if you're saying if you're if you're gonna do that [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2860.44s)]
*  I think you should probably say the whole story like how do you know how you know it's true? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2862.16s)]
*  Mmm, you know unless if you were you in the room, okay? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2865.68s)]
*  Then you heard a story who told you story [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2869.2400000000002s)]
*  Right you sure they weren't fucking with you [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2871.96s)]
*  They sure they weren't trying to find out if maybe you got a big mouth and you'll leak some information [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2874.2400000000002s)]
*  So they give you bad information because it's trying to sabotage your career [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2878.6s)]
*  I bet there's a lot of that house of cards shit going down. Oh for sure like Game of Thrones Ian type like [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2881.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I had actually heard this story [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2886.96s)]
*  I don't know if it's true, but I heard the story about how like when Kim and Kanye first had their baby [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2889.2400000000002s)]
*  Kim would give fake baby pictures to their friends and whenever one got leaked to the press [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2893.52s)]
*  She would know who the friend is I made me really like her as like that's some like sir see like high-level [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2898.28s)]
*  It's like real deal [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2905.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's really smart intelligent mm-hmm very intelligent, but that's also you realize there's traitors in your midst right? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2908.28s)]
*  That's and that's important to know because if you're Kim and Kanye have this baby that [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2914.96s)]
*  So there's someone's being offered a lot of money for that picture [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2918.2000000000003s)]
*  I say what the thing without maybe there's people we have like spies embedded, and they don't want to say like [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2921.0800000000004s)]
*  Who and why and how they found out you know cuz I would give away our spies [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2926.8399999999997s)]
*  What are you talking about for the McCall thing? Yeah? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2930.72s)]
*  How the guy found out he's like what if we have someone that's in Hamas or whatever and just like I don't want to let [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2933.12s)]
*  Everybody know we have [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2936.88s)]
*  Embedded spies that's true. Give it away, but it would have to be embedded in the IDF right [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2938.48s)]
*  It would whichever whatever the attack was but then saying something publicly would be like [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2943.16s)]
*  But then you shouldn't say something publicly right why would you say that we have been that Israel was warned so that is that a line? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2946.88s)]
*  Well this was so if you're protecting yourself your spies, and then you're saying something that it could only be spies [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2953.64s)]
*  You're not protecting your spies anymore [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2958.52s)]
*  You know I'm not saying that that's I'm just giving an example of what it could have been because he's saying it was classified [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2960.64s)]
*  And I don't want to get into well [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2965.2799999999997s)]
*  It was classified, but I'm telling you there was information that was given to them. That's all I said [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2966.2799999999997s)]
*  Right, but he he also we're saying the same thing we're going in circles. Yeah, he did say it [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2971.24s)]
*  He did say it yeah, and he can't say how he knows and so we're like huh, that's so you gotta trust me [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2976.8799999999997s)]
*  He's like you gotta trust me like you shouldn't say it then like if you're gonna say it you should say why? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2982.68s)]
*  Right because otherwise people gonna figure it out [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2989.56s)]
*  They're gonna go well. It's gotta be a or I or it's gonna die like that like [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2992.72s)]
*  We would have probably heard more about it new cycle. Yeah, I'm rolling. Yeah, right right [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=2997.2799999999997s)]
*  God [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3003.2799999999997s)]
*  How weird? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3004.7599999999998s)]
*  Imagine knowing that like an attack is coming on your city [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3007.6s)]
*  And you don't tell people well. It's like if that I mean that has to have happened. Oh for sure [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3012.16s)]
*  It's a history that has to have happened because you can look at like well [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3017.3999999999996s)]
*  These are the goals that I want yeah, and if I let and it involves demonizing this people if I let an attack happen [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3021.04s)]
*  If they even encourage an attack to happen now have an excuse now [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3030.12s)]
*  I have an excuse to really do what I want to do. Yeah, well [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3034.12s)]
*  That's where the conspiracy theories about net yahoo come up, right? Mm-hmm [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3037.62s)]
*  Well, yeah, I know at the time he was very unpopular well. They were protesting the streets [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3041.44s)]
*  Yeah, you know like hundreds of thousands of people and then all of a sudden all we have to consolidate we have to fight [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3046.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but people are terrified to admit that there's even a possibility of false flags and not I'm not saying this one was I'm saying [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3052.44s)]

*  And if you catch it wrong, you know, like Elon just hit it a little too hard. You want hit it [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3264.8199999999997s)]
*  He fucking bent the wrist. Yeah [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3269.9s)]
*  Yeah, he hit it a little too hard [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3272.14s)]
*  He hit it and then it also came at the at the right time for it too because they're all they're immediately looking for [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3273.9s)]
*  For the white supremacy angle. So it's like I you just sort of handed it to him on the silver platter [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3280.18s)]
*  Fascinating but but also and then objective people know that it's not true. You know, it's not true [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3285.3399999999997s)]
*  And yet you're you're going all in on it and you're like, okay [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3290.36s)]
*  So either I'm wrong and you don't know it's not true and you really do think you sick a secret Nazi [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3293.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, I know him and I can tell you he's not a secret Nazi [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3298.84s)]
*  He's not at all, but he is awkward because he's on the spectrum [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3301.6s)]
*  Mm-hmm, right which is also why he's a fucking genius running five different companies simultaneously while he's working for the government [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3305.28s)]
*  Like it's he just he's a very unusual person and I think [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3311.56s)]
*  You know when someone does something unfortunate like that you got to like look at his history and go does he show any [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3316.7400000000002s)]
*  Signs of Nazism before this no, he's never he went to a meeting. No never espoused now Nazi values. No [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3322.54s)]
*  But then there's a problem with X because X has Nazis on it [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3329.54s)]
*  Well, you know also have the Taliban, you know [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3333.9s)]
*  Well, that's the that's the thing about like if you truly want to create a free speech platform [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3336.6400000000003s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3342.52s)]
*  Does that you know, what does what does that entail and that entails all of that entails everything it entails all of that, bro [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3343.7599999999998s)]
*  There's there's wild shit on X [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3351.24s)]
*  There's this one guy that I was watching he does these videos where he pretends to be a gay guy [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3354.32s)]
*  Talking to someone in like a chat like, you know, they do like chat roulette. You're right. Yes [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3359.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and then he's talking to them and sometimes they're a gay guy and then he changes his face [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3364.86s)]
*  To look like a Nazi and is like a Nazi hat on and he fucking starts like saying heil Hitler and saying crazy shit [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3372.56s)]
*  To them. It's like and freaking them out. They scream and hang up the phones like [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3379.04s)]
*  Jesus Christ you like [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3383.64s)]
*  There's no limits to what you're allowed but is also you don't have to engage with that stuff [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3387.16s)]
*  you don't have to engage with it and it's and you know, maybe there is a sort of [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3392.32s)]
*  Argument to being like well if you let it if you let people let it out [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3397.32s)]
*  There is a it doesn't fester a situation happening, right? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3401.88s)]
*  Where it's like sort of sort of cuz I mean the part of what I think really helped Trump was them banning him on Twitter [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3405.84s)]
*  Banning him like a lot of it especially after 2020 if they left him alone [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3411.68s)]
*  It probably wouldn't have made him as strong for that second run as he was [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3415.18s)]
*  It's hard to say because maybe he would have gathered steam during that time talking about things [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3419.04s)]
*  Like he was essentially silenced [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3426.3199999999997s)]
*  Except for truth social and then people would post the things that he would write on true social. Yes [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3429.04s)]
*  What they definitely did is made him rich as fuck because truth social would have been worth five dollars [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3434.3199999999997s)]
*  If he hadn't been banned from Twitter [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3439.58s)]
*  Yeah, they really fucked up because he's one of the few people that could start a social media network and it actually succeeds [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3441.8399999999997s)]
*  But how it's not that big like how many people are on truth social but it's worth billions of dollars [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3448.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's worth way more than it would have been that's for sure [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3454.84s)]
*  It's not even close way more not even those work for him [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3457.36s)]
*  Whether they really realize it or not, but you can silence the guy from Twitter, but everybody knows you did it, right? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3460.88s)]
*  So since everybody knows you did it [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3466.52s)]
*  They know there's only one place to go and that's where you go to get them now [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3467.88s)]
*  It's the only place to go and they want to hear him talk [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3470.86s)]
*  They're gonna seek him out even journalists because you want to hear him talk some shit. So you join [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3472.88s)]
*  So now they have more members. How many members does true social have young Jamie? Let's get let's guess. Okay, what do you think? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3476.56s)]
*  Active use or like accounts or active users. Let's go with accounts accounts [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3483.48s)]
*  Right, yeah, right, right, right. Well, we'll do all of them though. We'll start with accounts. I'll do active you [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3490.6800000000003s)]
*  Just say 10 million accounts. It's probably low 10 million. Yeah, it's probably on the low end. Yeah [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3495.32s)]
*  I was gonna say like 20 million accounts. Yeah, just cuz just cuz I [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3499.4s)]
*  I actually haven't created a true social but like I've created a blue sky like people like are like I want to check this [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3504.2400000000002s)]
*  Out and see what's going on. Well, that's it's also the problem with those things is the problem that we already talked about is bots [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3510.2s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I think I think most of these websites are at least half bots now and I'm not kidding. I think this thing from [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3517.24s)]
*  Reddit this this manipulative thing. This is the tip of the iceberg [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3525.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, I think this is going on right in front of our face with constantly with the reddit [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3529.08s)]
*  especially because I'm a big reddit guy I love it and [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3534.52s)]
*  I would notice on all the major this is during the election all the major [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3537.7799999999997s)]
*  Like subreddits like the pictures and they are whatever whatever [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3542.66s)]
*  You know at a certain point leading up to the election [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3545.58s)]
*  They would be like I put my ballot in and I'm ready to go and it'd be a picture of a ballot that had Kamala [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3548.22s)]
*  checked off and every single major subreddit had a [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3552.52s)]
*  Version of that and I was like, oh, whoa, this is like real deal like [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3556.66s)]
*  Bot activity or like political propaganda that they're running through bots is like I thought that was weird [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3560.94s)]
*  Yeah, they definitely did that. Mm-hmm. And I think the Republicans did that as well. I think they both did that [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3566.02s)]
*  I don't I think honestly you have to do that now because first of all, it's legal right? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3570.94s)]
*  There's no laws against it, which is really crazy because it's kind of fraud [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3577.02s)]
*  I mean you can you can have fake people vote but you can have fake people [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3580.26s)]
*  Convince you to vote for their candidate, which is really weird [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3584.98s)]
*  Especially given this reddit test from Zurich like we know it's effective [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3589.3s)]
*  We know they can do it now and so they can just target you the only solution is to not be on it [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3594.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of like I think to me one of the biggest damages the social media has done [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3600.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a mid made whatever for whatever reason your politics is now your personality. It's your entire identity [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3605.32s)]
*  It's your entire identity is who you voted for and it's like [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3611.2400000000002s)]
*  That's in that, you know, that's an insane thing. The yes like really be like, oh, I base my friends on who they voted for [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3614.96s)]
*  I based my social circles around who they voted for like that's a crazy [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3621.82s)]
*  Dangerous way to be it's like there's no you don't want to you don't want the country to be in teams like that [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3625.98s)]
*  It's dangerously tribal. Yeah, you don't want it. Yeah, you want some people to be on this side [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3631.42s)]
*  Some people on this side and then most people to be like well what fits? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3637.0s)]
*  The sort of what the country needs right now and be more malleable, but the more and more people are getting [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3640.5s)]
*  Yeah separated. It's like worse and worse for the country. It's dangerous [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3645.86s)]
*  It's also stupid because most people don't even understand that they have been coerced into at least [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3649.66s)]
*  It's it's moved your opinion in a way dependent upon your environment the people you hang out with [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3657.98s)]
*  There's a lot of social dynamics at play when it comes to like political opinions [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3663.7799999999997s)]
*  There's truth. There's like undeniable truth [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3669.14s)]
*  And then there's a lot of like bullshit and gaslighting and you could choose to buy into either side [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3671.7799999999997s)]
*  Either side of the bullshit and gasline depending upon like how you're accepted in your community. We're just so [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3677.9s)]
*  malleable, which is why there's so many different cultures all over the world human beings are so malleable [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3685.1800000000003s)]
*  We're exactly the same thing but yet we were different [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3691.46s)]
*  Everywhere we're different in our behavior. We're different in our rules [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3696.06s)]
*  We're different in our customs and our traditions, but we're all the same fucking thing [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3699.7400000000002s)]
*  We can swing all we were adaptable to any kind of environment we can live in Siberia [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3705.82s)]
*  We can live in the Bahamas, you know [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3712.54s)]
*  We figure it out right and one of the ways to figure it out is you got to fit in [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3714.7s)]
*  Like you've got to fit in socially because if you don't you're not popular if you're not popular [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3718.9s)]
*  You know, you're not gonna get cooperation [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3724.06s)]
*  You're not gonna know who's gonna help you if things go bad [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3726.34s)]
*  Like you got to fit in [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3729.02s)]
*  Everybody did tribally when we were small groups of people and you have to do it like sort of almost publicly now [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3730.46s)]
*  Right. We just want to dance on things [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3737.78s)]
*  The weakest amongst us are the ones who are like chastising people for different political beliefs, right? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3739.94s)]
*  Amongst us right amongst comics, right? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3746.34s)]
*  The weakest amongst us are the ones who are attacking people for having different views [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3749.1s)]
*  Right, which is the whole point of this art form is to share your view, right? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3754.1s)]
*  But yeah, everyone does have to like it's weird like you need a stance [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3757.98s)]
*  I remember what you know, we're talking about Israel Palestine when it happened. I remember [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3760.66s)]

*  Condemned the attacks like I don't need the Miami Dolphins opinion on [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3767.78s)]
*  Giving people CTE like you have a moral stance on something that's crazy. But imagine like thinking hey guys, we got a condemn bad attack [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3773.66s)]

*  Didn't condemn it either [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3784.0600000000004s)]
*  Like imagine if everybody had to make a public condemnation like remember everybody had to put that black square on your Instagram [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3786.0600000000004s)]

*  like X or Twitter or whatever [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3834.94s)]
*  Accounts and then you notice how much how often they post and how much they post and you're like, oh my god [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3837.78s)]

*  Both things are true. So I know people who developed a social media following and then they were contacted [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3854.48s)]
*  To make political posts and they make fifty thousand dollars for a post [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3861.86s)]

*  Yeah, and if everybody keeps their mouth shut everybody just does it then you got a Congress type situation, you know [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3877.14s)]
*  but like when Kamala was running for president and there was we never figured out whether it's true but there was all this talk of [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3882.7400000000002s)]
*  These various celebrities that were paid large amounts of money to endorse her publicly. Mmm. Remember that? Yes [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3890.5s)]

*  If you spend one point five billion dollars in four months [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3910.58s)]
*  If I if I was a corrupt person [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3918.94s)]
*  You know what I would do I would make this the the cornerstone of [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3922.34s)]
*  Society's task is to make sure that Donald Trump doesn't get arrested and the or doesn't get elected rather and that we need to [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3929.34s)]
*  Throw as much money at Kamala Harris as possible and then be super irresponsible with that money [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3936.38s)]

*  Website for Kamala. There was no platform. No plan on what you want to do [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3966.2200000000003s)]
*  It was just don't have money stuff like buttons to donate money. That was probably they probably did like a whole like group [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3969.88s)]
*  Like focus group right to try to find out what's the best way should we put up her? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3977.64s)]
*  Just just buttons just ready to just donate [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3982.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it was very clear that they didn't give a fuck when like they released the official platform and so had Biden's name on [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3988.04s)]
*  The things it's like you couldn't even rewrite you couldn't even be bothered to write Kamala [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=3993.52s)]

*  I don't want to say that because if I don't know but I think [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4485.82s)]
*  I think there's a certain amount of curation that goes on in a lot of search engines [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4489.28s)]
*  Yeah, that would make sense. I mean I don't think there's anything [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4495.639999999999s)]

*  What do you think is real? What do you think is being sold to you? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4512.8s)]
*  What do you think is like you have to think critically about the news? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4515.2s)]
*  I think the brain is with the brave search engine. I think they claim is not [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4517.96s)]
*  Curated is that correct Jamie does duck duck go admit. It's curated or the next aid state [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4523.92s)]

*  Now at the very very bottom of every page. I mean this one doesn't say it [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4534.68s)]
*  But it says it's not it'll usually say it's personalized results are personal results are personalized [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4538.6s)]
*  Oh, you can try without personalization. This one actually said it last week. I was on not personalized [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4543.32s)]
*  That's what we're calling it now personalized [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4548.96s)]
*  Fucking reddit bots right? You know what you like. Oh, this is the thing. This is the news you we think you want [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4552.76s)]

*  Ideally though their goal is to try to help you find information fast. Oh sure yeah, but also they're curating information [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4564.92s)]
*  Specifically designed to manipulate you. Yeah, it seems like they're also trying to get to think in a certain way for sure [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4571.84s)]
*  Well, we had this guy Robert Epstein on a couple of times and he [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4577.32s)]
*  No, no, no, no, unfortunately. I'm related he [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4581.28s)]
*  found that [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4585.5599999999995s)]
*  curation of data in search engines can like [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4588.12s)]
*  Directly affect elections in a measurable way. Mm-hmm [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4592.5599999999995s)]
*  And I think one of the things they found is that people that were on the fence [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4595.679999999999s)]
*  Which is like a lot of us a lot of us the election comes like [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4599.12s)]
*  For him [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4601.64s)]
*  Fuck yeah, I know so you're in the fence. I haven't voted for president since 2012. How dare you? Yeah [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4604.04s)]
*  part of the problem [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4609.8s)]
*  The point being that like there's a lot of us that are on the fence [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4611.8s)]
*  It's like a significant amount like look at the amount of people that didn't vote in this country if they voted [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4614.92s)]
*  For like one person so the amount of people that didn't vote in America during the presidential election if they vote if they all [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4620.8s)]
*  Of them voted for one person [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4627.76s)]
*  Do you know crazy that is yeah, it's like 200 million vote or like a hundred million votes probably well [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4630.52s)]
*  It's like it has to be people over 18 that are registered voters [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4634.64s)]
*  All right, right, right [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4638.08s)]
*  But the numbers like what are the numbers of registered voters versus the number of people who actually voted in the election? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4638.96s)]
*  Oh, it's got to be low. We probably have a low turnout [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4645.84s)]
*  Comparatively well, didn't they say that like both Trump and Biden or Trump and comma rather got like 60 something million [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4649.96s)]
*  Votes each right wasn't it? Oh, right, right [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4658.4s)]
*  See April 30 2024 2025 rather in the 2024 presidential election [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4661.96s)]
*  73.6 percent or [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4668.4800000000005s)]
*  174 million people the citizen voting age population were was registered to vote and [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4671.16s)]
*  65 percent or [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4676.16s)]
*  154 million voted actually, okay, so that's percent of [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4678.24s)]
*  voters in vote yeah 12 percent but [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4683.28s)]
*  Almost 13 it's interesting right that's still not enough to win [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4686.0s)]
*  No, but it would be enough to affect one or the other to make them win a landslide [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4691.4s)]
*  And this is Epstein's point is that say like say if you? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4695.959999999999s)]
*  googled [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4700.04s)]
*  Something positive about Trump's policies. It wouldn't show you that it would show you like why he's going to jail [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4701.599999999999s)]
*  What a piece of shit is oh, is that like if you wanted to find out or the good policies of Kamala Harris or like? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4708.4s)]
*  It's manipulated right it's I mean it's not they're not lying to you. They're giving you articles that exist [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4714.74s)]
*  But they're curating how you see them in a way that is [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4721.26s)]
*  Statistically gonna affect your opinion right especially if you're one of those people that's susceptible to having your opinions [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4725.7s)]
*  You know which is most people most people which is like pretty much everyone right yeah [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4732.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think everyone likes to think that they're this person of principle [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4737.38s)]
*  But you can you can be moved up of a position a lot quicker than you probably think a bri this one on who's a [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4741.38s)]
*  scientist who studies mind control and [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4748.34s)]

*  Hmm that they're above it and yeah, and that you could never be in a cult or you could never get drawn into something like yes [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=4764.14s)]

*  Well the idea of like the first humans to like write a language down [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5044.7s)]
*  That must have been such a mind-blowing [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5047.7s)]
*  There's so much [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5049.7s)]
*  confusion as to when that was [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5051.7s)]
*  You know they used to think it was like 6,000 years ago [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5053.7s)]
*  You know they used to think it was like 6,000 years ago [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5057.0199999999995s)]
*  But there's a lot of people that have some pretty compelling arguments that existed a long long long time before that. Mmm [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5059.58s)]
*  You know the the thoughts was that like that cuneiform shit that stuff that comes out of like those are the first ones, right? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5065.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they thought. Mm-hmm. But now there's a lot of these ancient history [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5071.42s)]
*  Graham Hancock type dudes that are going, you know, I have a feeling that's a rebirth of civilization not civilizations birth that there was another [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5075.66s)]
*  civilization that probably existed a long [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5083.54s)]
*  Fucking time ago and they're probably wiped out and that's what all the flood stories are all about right stories in the Bible of Apocalypse [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5086.7s)]
*  Is it's probably probably based on some real shit [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5092.62s)]
*  Damn and it just this this sort of existed and then this is their sort of ashes or the Phoenix out of what's created [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5095.66s)]
*  I think the idea is [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5102.3s)]
*  Well, the idea is that [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5104.26s)]
*  Massive catastrophe all over the earth about eleven thousand eight hundred years ago and then you have about [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5106.9s)]
*  5,000 years of people being complete barbarians [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5112.86s)]
*  Until they figure out civilization again, right and it's just a sort of cycle that this happens over and over again [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5116.7s)]
*  Yep. Yep, and then there's a cycle of the shifting of the magnetic poles [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5122.0199999999995s)]
*  The the magnetic poles shift. I want to say is it every 12,000 years? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5127.94s)]
*  Which would cause havoc right is that about to happen again, I think it is [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5134.98s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like if we're in some end time shit that feels like that's about to happen [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5139.74s)]
*  I feel like that could 100% happen right now [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5143.54s)]
*  Like you wake up one day and all the powers out and everyone's sick and the fucking sky is green as an aurora [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5147.38s)]
*  borealis over Brazil [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5154.86s)]
*  Everything's all fucked up [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5156.7s)]
*  Yeah, that can happen that does happen [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5159.14s)]
*  Earth's magnetic poles flip in the South Pole swapping places [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5162.46s)]
*  But there's no set schedule for when this happens [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5167.0199999999995s)]
*  Geologically is estimated to occur every 200 to 300 thousand years on average. However, the timing has varied wildly with some flips [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5170.7s)]
*  happening as frequently as every 10,000 years and [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5179.34s)]
*  Others as infrequently as every 50 million years. Oh great [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5182.62s)]
*  Oh [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5186.5s)]
*  This is the last full reversal Oh a full reversal not like those little baby reversal, right was [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5195.18s)]
*  780,000 years ago. Oh, well, it's definitely do then. Yeah [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5201.26s)]
*  Yeah, what good that if the average is 300,000 we're doing crazy [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5203.7s)]
*  We're doing but we could do like bank on the 50 million. I'll be nice. Yeah, nice. We want to live recklessly. Yeah [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5207.38s)]
*  I'm gonna happen for another 50 million. We're good. We got another 49 million compared according to my experts [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5214.26s)]
*  According my ex it's safe and effective. Yeah at that point just say you don't know when it's gonna happen [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5223.02s)]
*  The range of 10,000 to 50 million is [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5227.900000000001s)]
*  Insanity to tell me okay. Let's Google this [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5231.46s)]
*  What happens when Earth's magnetic poles shift like what happens if there's a complete reversal of the pole? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5233.9400000000005s)]
*  What do you think is the what what kind of calamity ensues like do you what it? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5242.22s)]
*  They must have studied it right? I mean, I don't know if you haven't 780,000 years ago [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5248.26s)]
*  How much can you really know but if two dumbasses like you and I are sitting around discussing it? They must have discussed this [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5253.0199999999995s)]
*  Magnetic poles shift also known as a [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5261.34s)]
*  Geomagnetic reversal the north and south magnetic pole swap locations effectively inverting the planet's magnetic [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5265.0199999999995s)]
*  Field this process happens over a period of centuries not millennia not instantly while the magnetic field weakens during a reversal [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5271.7s)]
*  It doesn't disappear completely. There's no evidence that pole reversals cause massive earthquakes rapid climate change or species extinctions [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5279.34s)]
*  Okay, so must be so slow that it's manageable [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5287.74s)]
*  Watch too much YouTube. Yeah, I get that they freaked me out. I get that. That's me [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5293.26s)]
*  How do we know is this this hasn't happened in 780,000 years [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5296.86s)]
*  This is probably all theoretical as well, right? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5300.38s)]
*  And also if I did think it was gonna cause calamity the last thing I do is tell the general public [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5302.74s)]
*  Mmm, I'd be like listen, we'll be fine. It takes millions of years. Everything is good. Don't worry about it [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5307.299999999999s)]
*  We really have to worry about climate change is that is that what you consume most now is YouTube? Yeah. Yeah, right [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5312.86s)]
*  That's the way that's the that seems to be the you know, what's huge now is are you like into any of these streamers? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5318.719999999999s)]
*  No, they're so [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5324.98s)]
*  Massive I had this thought of like the other day of like, you know [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5327.78s)]
*  How it was like a big deal that Kamala didn't come on this podcast, right? It's gonna be in like [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5331.54s)]
*  Ten years or so like oh you didn't see kaisen at you didn't like that's why Jake Paul became president [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5336.78s)]
*  He was on pison that scream talking about why he should be president or something like that [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5342.459999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. It's like someone like Jake Paul could be president. Mm-hmm [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5346.339999999999s)]
*  If Donald Trump can be president Jake Paul, yeah, I'm not saying that Donald Trump isn't a big-time businessman and capable [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5350.38s)]
*  I thought right not an insult. I'm saying we know now that super popular people can be president [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5356.620000000001s)]
*  No, let's imagine Jake Paul is young and wild and he's a professional boxer right now [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5361.96s)]
*  But he will he be in 20 years? No, he'll be retired and you know [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5367.18s)]
*  Maybe he'll have some good ideas and that we might have president Jake Paul. Yeah, not bullshitting. Yeah [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5371.700000000001s)]
*  I know I think that's a definite possibility. Oh, we are look [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5376.3s)]
*  We're so close but yeah, idiotic. I so close to that movie. I do have a pro wrestling president [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5380.1s)]
*  We're kind of already there. The Rock could be president [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5387.5s)]
*  1000% easily easily easily easily and they contacted them. They tried to get him to run. Yeah, that makes sense [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=5390.5s)]

*  No, dude, I think so. I think no dude if you could if you love playing with the Kamala Harris character on half-life [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6820.4400000000005s)]
*  If like that's your like you have partner right like you could have an AI partner [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6827.96s)]
*  And it literally is Kamala Harris and she runs around in half-life with you shooting at aliens and shit [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6832.28s)]

*  Yeah, that's actually she's super cool in the game. She's really funny [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6844.88s)]
*  She helps you she gets you clues into how to get out of places [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6849.04s)]

*  Yeah, that's the way they can reach you is like sure [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6868.08s)]
*  Yeah, cuz right now all the streaming stuff seems like it's like the almost not Wild West II [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6871.200000000001s)]
*  But it's still kind of new the second politics figures out a way to really get their hands in it [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6875.68s)]
*  I think it's kind of over the real goal the real gateway to hell is [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6879.96s)]
*  neural interfaces [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6886.280000000001s)]
*  That's the real gateway. So where you're like just you can immediately just be in the world the real matrix. Mmm like that [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6888.200000000001s)]
*  It's a hundred percent on the it's on the menu. It's coming [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6895.64s)]
*  Oh, it's just a matter of time and when you can't tell at all whether or not you really have an experience [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6899.160000000001s)]
*  That's when you're in a simulation and that might have already happened [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6905.96s)]
*  Yeah, that might be what we're dealing with right now that were that were just the simulation creating its next simulation its next iteration [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6910.360000000001s)]
*  Maybe why it's so wacky? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6917.0s)]
*  Why it feels so fake? [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6919.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6921.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it is it is it is wild just like it's the world we live in where like comedians are like [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6923.4800000000005s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense to me sometimes we'll look around any sense [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6930.6s)]
*  Yeah, where it's like comedians are selling out arenas regularly regular regular all of our friends. Yeah [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6933.32s)]
*  They're just arena acts all of a sudden and like yeah instantly [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6941.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, I think it about but a part of that has to do with like as things get more fake people will try to strive [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6945.5599999999995s)]
*  For things they know is real 100% and so what I know is real is this guy talking to me in person right now [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6950.759999999999s)]
*  Yes, I'm so because of the restrictive nature of all [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6956.759999999999s)]
*  All [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6961.4s)]
*  Whatever you see on television any regular television show [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6962.679999999999s)]
*  Not even television like the the censorship on social media sometimes is like like I [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6966.12s)]
*  I did this sketch with one of our uh, the door guys at mothership christina mariani killing it and [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6972.04s)]
*  In this sketch we have her tell me to kill myself. That's part of that's the sort of right and you can't in the captions [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6978.92s)]
*  They took it down because we spelled out the world kill which you can't do [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6986.28s)]
*  You and you can't say the words kill yourself and it's like it's just a small little sketch and it's like already it's like [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6991.24s)]
*  There's so much like [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6997.48s)]
*  There's so much holding you back from like having a true expression sometimes that like people will go to seek it out live [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=6999.639999999999s)]
*  That's what I think there's definitely some part of that. Yeah for sure [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7005.639999999999s)]
*  I think people are definitely aware that there's a bunch of stuff [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7009.8s)]
*  You can't talk about in social media that you want to talk about on stage that are funny [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7012.44s)]
*  well, and it's also so funny to me where it's like [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7017.16s)]
*  Social media. This is big like oh mental health is important, but like you can't you have to write unalive yourself in the caption [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7019.8s)]
*  It's like okay, so we can't have serious discussions about these topics really [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7025.48s)]
*  Right like there's certain if certain words are off limits [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7029.88s)]
*  Then there's no way you can have an actual serious discussion where those words are involved, right? [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7033.48s)]
*  100 because then they just expand the definition of offense, right? [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7038.28s)]
*  And then now this is expensive now. That's a new version a new we have an updated list of words [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7042.5199999999995s)]
*  You can't say and we were talking about like all these bots earlier [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7047.64s)]
*  So like we don't want these words to offend people but we're not even talking to people [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7050.76s)]
*  This is all going out to computer programs, right? It's computer programs watching other computer programs being offended [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7055.240000000001s)]
*  That's like it's crazy [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7061.08s)]
*  But offending people should be the least of your concern when you're allowing open manipulation by university [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7062.12s)]
*  But then like and also this is just the one we know about [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7068.68s)]
*  We didn't know about that until they told us right and they didn't have to tell us [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7072.280000000001s)]
*  No, they just decided to I guess in a way of like warning like hey, this is probably happening [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7075.5599999999995s)]
*  In a bunch of ways. I'm glad they did they shouldn't have done it in the first place, but i'm well [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7081.0s)]
*  Look, it's being done. It's being done and it's not like they came up with the idea [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7085.959999999999s)]
*  They're the only ones doing it. I guarantee you it's being done [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7090.599999999999s)]
*  There's probably a bunch of people that have ai friends [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7093.0s)]
*  Online that they communicate with on twitter and you know, hey good to hear from you [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7096.04s)]

*  Who knows what it means. It's a cloudy environment [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7133.08s)]
*  The ufo world is like one of the slipperiest worlds [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7136.44s)]
*  When you're talking to people there's grip there's full-on grifters [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7140.5199999999995s)]

*  They're always off and then they have like some good data that they pull from [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7148.68s)]
*  Disclosure and from all these different people that talked about different things [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7153.38s)]

*  It's like a lot of weird people in that world [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7159.8s)]
*  Yes, it's good [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7162.04s)]
*  Well, it's easy to do that in that world too where like a lot of it is like does this even exist? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7162.76s)]
*  Yep, so you can just be like well I have proof. Yeah, if you don't have good ethics if you're not like a legitimate journalist [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7167.08s)]
*  You know, but what's interesting is when legitimate journalists get interested like schellenberger when michael schellenberger [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7173.96s)]
*  reports on uaps [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=7179.240000000001s)]

*  Mmm. What does he say and that's whether they reconsidered Cawthorn's membership in the group [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8262.58s)]
*  Yeah [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8267.5s)]
*  He basically said that clear that he has evidence of taking part in group sex and drug use [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8268.02s)]
*  Perry wouldn't say either way we will discuss that when we get to it [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8273.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think when asked whether they would reconsider Cawthorn's membership in the group if he didn't make clear [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8278.38s)]
*  Whom he has evidence so Cawthorn was saying someone has evidence [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8284.26s)]
*  That he has evidence of some people taking part of group sex not him right no [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8289.02s)]
*  I think Cawthorn was saying something the effect of [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8293.5s)]
*  To move up in this world or whatever you have to take part in the drugs in the group sex and then being like [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8296.140000000001s)]

*  He was invited he claims. He was invited to an orgy in Washington right, but no one was saying that he did [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8306.74s)]
*  I thought you were saying that he was wrapped up in it [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8312.18s)]
*  So this is what killed him that he was saying this and now people and they killed his career and they were like that [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8314.7s)]

*  What what does it say after that leave it back up [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8372.7s)]
*  It's not clear to me whether Cawthorn is suggesting that members of Congress have invited him to orgies or just other people in Washington [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8378.220000000001s)]

*  How do we? [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8724.96s)]
*  Curb that in our community of being like hey, we shouldn't accept this [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8726.84s)]
*  Like we shouldn't I you know, I remember when the Charlie Abdel attacks happened a lot of people like damn [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8731.88s)]

*  No one's gonna kill you right like that that there's sort of like this sort of [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8746.28s)]
*  Westernization that kind of needs to happen that it doesn't look like it's happening over there in a way that's kind of happening [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8750.52s)]
*  Look what's going on in Toronto where Ontario made it legal to have polygamy [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8755.38s)]
*  Right. Yeah, that's why right it's like dudes want multiple wives. It's in the Quran [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8760.18s)]
*  You know it is but [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8766.78s)]

*  You know imagine if the Christian said listen, we're open to new ideas. I think maybe the Mormons had a point [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8777.86s)]
*  Because the Mormons that's how they got it, right? [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8784.58s)]
*  The whole reason why they went to Mexico just because the United States said no to polygamy [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8787.14s)]
*  Right, you know, that's the whole thing about what's his face from Massachusetts? [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8791.66s)]

*  Never seen that no, dude. There was a shootout Mormons versus the cartels [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8809.34s)]
*  Great movie title one of there was a big problem a few years back [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8814.3s)]
*  Because a few people I think woman and a child and a couple other people got murdered by the cartels [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8818.9s)]
*  And it became like a giant issue. So they they set these compounds up in like the [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8825.939999999999s)]
*  1800s whenever [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8833.14s)]
*  The Mormons were not allowed to be poly [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8834.859999999999s)]
*  Polygamists here in America. So they just said well who cares back then there was no cars [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8837.9s)]
*  Did Mexico is just as good as living in America, right? [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=8841.9s)]

*  EATR forget what it stands for but it's fueled by biological material, dude [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9903.24s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like scientists don't watch any movie [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9913.08s)]

*  We're making fucking weapons. All right, what's the best way to fuel these things? [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9920.76s)]
*  Is it solar should we get out there and fill their tank up with gas or let them eat bodies? [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9924.26s)]
*  And I think it was any kind of biological material so it could be plants could be just plants [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9929.76s)]
*  It could just be those ground squirrels. Yeah, you see ground squirrels [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9934.68s)]
*  Yeah, maybe these fucking dead bodies on the battlefield and just keep going right if you're a robot an autonomous robot that exists on [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9937.58s)]
*  Biological materials and you also kill people you got plenty of fuel, right? [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9946.26s)]
*  You just eat a couple of those people you keep going [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9951.460000000001s)]
*  They really design [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9954.58s)]
*  artificially intelligent [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9956.94s)]
*  Robots that kill people and eat them because that's the way to really do if you want to do battle efficiently [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9958.78s)]
*  Well, what fuel would be the most efficient fuel to use? Well, what is it? What is the fuel that you're making with your task? [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9964.660000000002s)]
*  Well, that would be bodies well when you run out of bodies is your task done [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9970.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so then you just shut off [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9977.14s)]
*  Because you're out of fuel. So you run out of gas when you've eaten everybody on earth. It's the perfect design [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9980.14s)]
*  It's that perfect killing machine if you wanted to extinguish human life on earth. That's what you do. You'd have autonomous [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9985.539999999999s)]
*  intelligence artificial intelligence that absolutely knows where everyone is at any given time because everybody has a digital signature and everyone's [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9992.14s)]
*  Connected to devices and all you do is kill and eat people and just send them loose and they would be [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=9999.58s)]
*  Indestructible and they would find you in buildings [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10005.859999999999s)]
*  They would fucking go upstairs to your apartment find you and eat you and when they're done eating everybody on the planet [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10007.9s)]

*  Program a robot that eats people. Damn how far how much time do you think we have left? I [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10021.3s)]
*  I don't think we have a hundred years. You don't think we have a hundred years. No, I don't think so either unless [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10027.78s)]
*  This is the other possibility like the AI just leaves. No, I'm totally talking about my ass. There's a couple options [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10033.86s)]
*  Mm-hmm. One of the big options is we integrate so instead of letting it eat us what we do is become one with it [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10039.380000000001s)]
*  so instead of just being a [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10047.18s)]
*  territorial ape with thermonuclear weapons and a [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10049.820000000002s)]

*  Okay, I think it wasn't on the internet though. What that's part of the deal. Yeah, but it wasn't on the internet, right? [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10100.98s)]

*  That's right. So the 3g one was the first one where it actually became feasible that you would use it as a web browser [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10130.98s)]
*  Now it's instantaneous, right? [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10137.22s)]

*  And then text it to a friend of mine and it just said okay, and it just did it [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10171.62s)]
*  It did all those things what what application would you like me to use Google tasks? [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10177.460000000001s)]
*  It just does this for him and it all automates just for my prompt [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10181.54s)]
*  So he talks his phone his phones like his assistant [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10185.98s)]
*  Tell him, you know set that shit on my calendar put it in my schedule [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10188.82s)]
*  Send me a text message when it's come time put an alert so I know when it's coming up. Okay, it just does it all [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10192.42s)]
*  That's wild. I've never 20 years. I've never used Siri. So I'm not serious all the time [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10199.300000000001s)]
*  And then Siri doesn't know what the fuck is going on. So Siri's always like would you like to use chat GPT? [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10204.7s)]
*  I'm like bitch. Why am I asking why my if you got to keep going to chat GPT should I replace you? [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10209.300000000001s)]
*  Gemini seems to have the answers [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10215.9s)]
*  Gemini is way better than Siri. It's way better [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10218.26s)]
*  Feels like and I know nothing about how AI works, but it feels like because Siri was already there [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10222.42s)]
*  It's like trying to implement AI to an interface. That's kind of old the Google interface [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10226.58s)]
*  With AI in the phones and all the Google ecosystem is way better. It's just it's way more effective [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10232.02s)]
*  It's quicker. It gets it. It'll it'll follow a chain of questions like you can ask it another question [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10238.74s)]
*  How should I do that? What should I do with it? And it follows what you're saying? Okay [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10244.62s)]
*  It's just a better design and it's integrated with so like Siri has to ask chat GPT [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10248.68s)]
*  And like would you like to use chat GPT? But bitch, what do you think? [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10254.22s)]
*  Yes, if you don't have the answer go to chat GPT get me the fucking answer [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10256.96s)]
*  Whereas the Google cuts that step out it gives you the answer immediately. It's just better at it integrates with Gmail [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10260.76s)]
*  It's but it's just a better system [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10267.24s)]
*  But they're working on it, you know, it's like all these things are getting better, you know, like all the AI is getting better [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10269.64s)]
*  So much better, I mean just the video we watched like the AI capability six months ago [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10275.0s)]

*  Oh, you'll see it where like people like oh you're falling for this AI thing [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10286.679999999998s)]
*  And it took me a second to realize like oh, it's AI. Yeah [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10290.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, a lot of those I posted one of a butterfly no mantis [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10293.679999999998s)]

*  there's a lot of people that believe things and the thing is like a [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10338.0s)]
*  Lot of the stuff that you're fed that's fake [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10340.720000000001s)]
*  You're fed by people who want you to repeat it because they're trying to muddy the waters of reality right which is a great strategy [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10343.28s)]
*  Well, if you if you say it enough it can be real. There's a certain truth to it, right? [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10350.800000000001s)]
*  So it's like that [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10354.6s)]
*  But there's also say something that is real and attach a bunch of really goofy shit to it so that it's not real anymore [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10355.54s)]
*  Mmm [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10361.18s)]

*  Like there's so much of that stuff that seems like so hokey [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10376.300000000001s)]
*  You don't even want to repeat it and it's but yet it's connected to things like gravity propulsion drives [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10379.94s)]
*  Which were theorized about in the 1950s and there's real research was done on them [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10384.86s)]
*  It seems like some maybe some groundbreaking advancements were kind of concealed from the public like and but then it's like I was abducted [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10389.22s)]
*  And they took all of my sperm and like you know [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10396.34s)]
*  I mean it's like all these people that are connected to it that are goofy you wonder like how much of that goofy shit is on purpose [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10398.34s)]
*  To make the whole thing seem stupid because what they're really trying to do is obscure something [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10405.9s)]
*  Mmm [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10411.42s)]

*  Connection Scientology right connected to something that you don't want to talk about you know Bigfoot [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10440.060000000001s)]
*  Oh, you know I mean it's like those those kind of strategies for [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10446.1s)]
*  Taking real information and muddy it up with a bunch of nutty shit [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJ82qpiZME&t=10451.460000000001s)]
