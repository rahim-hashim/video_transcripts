# Joe Rogan Experience #2242 - Bert Sorin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a0_KkmRSe0)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Good to see you, Joe.
*  What's going on, man?
*  Good to see you, man.
*  Thank you very much for that extraordinary piece of athletic equipment you brought to
*  the gym.
*  Absolutely.
*  Is there a photo of that so we can show people what it looks like?
*  Yeah, it should be on the website X Factor.
*  And what is it called?
*  It's called the X Factor.
*  Oh, it's called the X Factor.
*  What is the website?
*  Soarnext.com.
*  Go to Soarnext.com, check out the X Factor.
*  Sorry, it's actually, pull it up, Jamie.
*  Pull it up, Jamie.
*  Isn't that nice to say that?
*  Shush, man.
*  It's fine, right?
*  It's big.
*  So this is the machine.
*  Yeah, it's actually Judd who was here a minute ago.
*  Yeah, it is a brilliant machine, man.
*  The idea that you could push and pull rotational power machine.
*  It really is a genius idea, man.
*  And for things like striking sports, that's huge.
*  Like the ability to push and pull at the same time while stabilizing your core.
*  That is undoubtedly going to help people.
*  You're definitely going to be able to deliver more power in strikes.
*  Right, because you take the ground force and then be able to put it through, obviously,
*  what the core, all three planes of motion, all obviously go through your core, and then
*  puts it into either your feet or your arms.
*  It's just so unusual that you can do something like that.
*  I guess you kind of can do something like that with cables, with the cable machine,
*  but that seems better.
*  Yeah, because you have a little bit of a balance component as well, but you're right, like
*  you're blocking, let's say you're right-handed, you're blocking on that left leg, you're stabilizing
*  out the right hamstring and hip.
*  But yeah, especially when you get that little extra extension, I call it the riblets right
*  there, your obliques, it just locks everything in.
*  So I'm interested to see what you come up with.
*  It's pretty dope.
*  Are you telling me that this was originally, like you came up with this idea from an older
*  machine that's not around anymore?
*  Yeah, so we've, you know, I've been in this industry a long time, as well as you have,
*  but it's kind of taken a remastered series where we're taking all the cool stuff that
*  was, could have been our designs, but it could have been just old designs that are just kind
*  of lost to the ages.
*  And you're like, hey, that was a cool piece, but it sucked because you had to load it weird,
*  or it was like maybe it wasn't as safe as it could have been.
*  And so it's like, let's break the whole thing apart, figure out what was good about it.
*  And then that was like the eighth iteration.
*  We just kept playing with it.
*  And then it was like, when you realize the double axis is what made the user experience
*  cool.
*  And it was like, okay, this is badass.
*  And you know, I sent that video to you and then a couple colleges have already bought
*  them.
*  And then Ryan Krauser, the world champion and record holder in the shot put was like,
*  yeah, like this is all rotational power.
*  How do we turn that on?
*  Yeah, it's so cool today because there's so much social media and there's so many videos
*  and YouTube videos of people using equipment.
*  Like 15, 20 years ago, you had to go to a gym and go, oh, what is that?
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  Where'd you get that?
*  How does that work?
*  The big guy in the gym, you had to like, hey, what's the deal?
*  Yeah.
*  You and I grew up in the same era where we're going to gyms all the time and there's a bunch
*  of quacks telling you to do stuff.
*  Always.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he was a bro scientist.
*  Total bro scientist.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you just like, hey, if that guy's really good at something, you know, back in
*  the day, I would, after I compete, probably much like you, after I compete, I would get
*  whoever was better than me and I would offer to take them out to dinner and I would just
*  go, hey, like I feed them beers until they basically told me how they beat me.
*  I just like, well, how much are you cleaning or what are you doing?
*  Then I would pick up some little idiosyncrasy of training.
*  They're like, oh, we would do this contrast.
*  And I'm like, what's that?
*  And I would just keep digging and digging and digging.
*  I'd go back and figure it out.
*  Well, I remember when I was competing, they would tell you to not lift weights, which
*  is so hilarious.
*  You don't get muscle down, Joe.
*  They used to say that.
*  They used to say it will slow you down and you'll become tight.
*  Yeah.
*  And I remember thinking like, why don't you just stretch if you're tight?
*  Yeah.
*  So horsepower makes the car slower.
*  It didn't make any sense to me.
*  It's like they thought that the only exercise you should do is martial arts itself.
*  Hit the bag, train.
*  When do you think that?
*  Well, you got, Bruce Lee would do, I mean, he did some exercise.
*  Did a lot of isometrics.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And he had some lifting, but it was always pretty light.
*  But what would you say was the, when that changed?
*  I think it was Evander Holyfield.
*  I think it was Mackie Shilstone trained Evander Holyfield when he went up to heavyweight.
*  And I remember myself at the time.
*  So this was in the 90s.
*  I remember thinking, what is he doing?
*  He's lifting weights.
*  He's going to fuck himself up.
*  Don't doesn't he know that all these coaches have already figured it out?
*  Right. And then also Evander got all these traps, dude, he was trapped and dealt it out.
*  He got jacked and he became a legitimate heavyweight.
*  Also, pretty sure there was some Mexican supplements involved.
*  Yeah, he might have gone across the border.
*  I mean, I think it's a good time.
*  I think it's a strong possibility that there was some help, because also, like, you never
*  heard of anybody tested positive for steroids back then.
*  No. And I know for a fact that some of those guys were on steroids.
*  I would not disagree.
*  I know people who know people.
*  And I mean, we're all the same.
*  I would fucking put it all on black.
*  Yeah. Well, because up until 91, steroids weren't even illegal as a controlled substance.
*  Do you know who caused it to be illegal?
*  Joe Biden. No shit.
*  Yep. That motherfucker.
*  It was all him. Yeah.
*  You know, Derek from More Plates, More Dates was telling us about it the other day.
*  I'm like, that motherfucker. He did it.
*  That should be a loan.
*  Well, I guess the idea is that people could abuse it.
*  Right. Right. Here's the deal, folks.
*  You can abuse almost everything.
*  Sure. This is my argument against online gambling.
*  You know, there's a lot of people that think online gambling should be banned
*  because so many people are losing money on online gambling.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Do you know how easy it is to not online gamble?
*  It's so easy. You know how easy it is?
*  I've never online gambled.
*  It makes two of us. That's how easy it is to not online gambling.
*  I'd probably forget my password to get into the thing.
*  But yeah, like I'm not discounting the fact that gambling is addictive.
*  I personally know gambling addicts.
*  One of my best friends, Dana White, is a fucking gambling addict.
*  He happens to be insanely wealthy so he can get away with it.
*  But that helps.
*  I grew up in pool halls.
*  I know gambling addicts. I get it.
*  I'm not one.
*  So it's possible to like fucking have some self-control and discipline and willpower.
*  The weird thing, I've never done crack either.
*  Crazy. It's strange.
*  Do you know crack is everywhere and it's a scourge of humanity?
*  I've never done crack.
*  You know, it's really weird.
*  I'm so I've never even seen crack.
*  I've seen it. Yeah, I I saw cocaine once in my entire life, which is wild
*  based on that is I know a lot of people and it's like, yeah, like,
*  did they just think I would just say no to that?
*  Because I grew up in the 80s, just say no generation.
*  But I haven't seen I didn't think it was like a real thing since I was in high school.
*  I've never really. Yeah.
*  Which is kind of crazy, because I know so many people who do coke. Yeah.
*  But I was at a party in high school the last time I saw someone doing coke.
*  No way. Yeah. In your world.
*  Yeah, my world. Yeah.
*  Why don't I don't do anything like that?
*  I don't ever fuck around. I've never done coke.
*  I never even thought about doing it.
*  Yeah. Never had the desire because I was around people
*  that were abusing it when I was in high school.
*  Sure. I was like, OK.
*  Do you think that's because you're such like a strong personality
*  and like kind of role model that people like, hey, Joe's not into that.
*  Like, keep it away from him.
*  Um, you think they're like respectful of that and just kind of know the deal?
*  They just know I don't want it.
*  Yeah, I think. Yeah.
*  I'm just not interested in anything that gives me more confidence.
*  I'm not interested in that. I got plenty of that.
*  I like humility.
*  I'm looking for humility.
*  I don't like confidence boosters.
*  I don't like anything that gives you like a ridiculous sense of like your.
*  Yeah, it's like I'm not.
*  I'd rather be humble.
*  I'm not interested.
*  I mean, delusion is a is a strong is a strong suit.
*  If sometimes. Yeah.
*  No. And it could get you bound up to.
*  Definitely. Yeah.
*  I think it gets you pretty far.
*  And then your fucking wheels come off.
*  You're in a ditch.
*  It's like when you're skateboarding, when you're a kid.
*  You need to see a guy on a motorcycle and you see when they do that.
*  You're like, no.

*  It's like you had Josh Rollin on the other day.
*  That was like what he did in Goonies. Remember he had the little bike?
*  Oh, that's right.
*  He was talking about the motorcycle.
*  All I could think about is my head is him flying off the cliff in Goonies.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  I forgot he was in Goonies.
*  Yeah, I should have brought that up.
*  We could have. We should have. I wanted to bring it up so bad.
*  I was on the plane. I was riding a plane.
*  I was like, all I could see is that cat in sweatpants with his shorts
*  on top of his sweatpants riding a tricycle or whatever down this hill.
*  He's one of the rare guys that was like a child actor that turned out really awesome.
*  Yeah, that's a that's a that's a small club.
*  That's a fucking super small club.
*  Yeah, because everybody that I know and I know a few people personally
*  that were famous as a young person, they're out of their fucking mind.
*  They're just they're they're like, you know what I say?
*  It's like, look at him.
*  Hey, I have a good memory. Look at me.
*  How old was he back then?
*  He's probably 17 or 18.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Well, he's two years younger than me.
*  Eighty five and eighty five. I was 18.
*  So he's probably like, well, the 80s not so awesome.
*  80s were pretty cool.
*  Except everybody's worried that Russia was going to blow us up.
*  The true story. Yeah, story. Yeah.
*  I remember 85. I believe it was 85 going to
*  I know, obviously, we're both in archery.
*  So 85 Rambo First Blood Part Two came out.
*  Pops took me to the movie theater.
*  He and I saw it and we went straight from there to the archery shop.
*  I got my first bow that day. Really? I still have it. Wow.
*  Yeah, it's awesome. I still have some of the same arrows. No shit.
*  Yeah, I strangely don't lose things.
*  But yeah, I remember in the backyard shooting because like he kind of half
*  taught me and then I was in the backyard zinging arrows and thinking like,
*  if I had explosive tips, like a badass with this beat.
*  I went to Lenai and, you know, they have the Pineapple Brothers
*  has that archery and I brought my whole family.
*  And then they also have this area where you can go
*  and you can like shoot skeet and you drive like four four wheelers
*  under the mountains.
*  And then they had like traditional archery, like bows and arrows.
*  And I was like, oh, let me try this.
*  I don't know how to fucking aim. I'm terrible at it.
*  I was like, I'm a good archer. I should be good at this.
*  I could barely hit the fucking target from 20 yards away.
*  It's like the science and the art, two different things.
*  They're totally, totally different. Yeah.
*  I've always said, like the guys that are traditional hunters,
*  you know, trad guys, they're either weirdos or they're absolute killers.
*  Right. It's like Aaron Snyder type dudes. Yeah.
*  Who are so good at compound archery, they get tired of it.
*  Yeah. Or they're weird guys that smell like sausage and live in a mom's basement.
*  And they're like, you're like, I yeah, I know you do that,
*  but you probably go to like renfares and stuff, too.
*  So I'm not sure what's the deal.
*  Well, at archery country, you know, the local archery shop here in town,
*  whenever I get a new bow or I get a new sight and I have to sight it in,
*  we go to their they have an indoor range.
*  And a lot of times in the indoor range, there's these dorks.
*  Sorry, folks, dorks with recurves.
*  And they're fucking they're at 20 yards.
*  They're spread. It's like my arm length.
*  It's like you're barely hitting the target.
*  It's wild. Don't do that. This is stupid.
*  You don't you don't shoot like a like a cardinal direction.
*  I'm sure the east today.
*  Well, when they get good, like I've seen Snyder, like he's such a bad ass
*  at 40 that are like the size of a silver dollar.
*  But most people struggle pretty hardcore.
*  But they say also that if you do want to hunt with it,
*  you have to practice every day because it's almost like throwing a ball.
*  Like, you know, if you're throwing a ball, you know how much the ball weighs
*  because you throw it a bunch of times and you have like this muscle memory
*  that if I throw that hard at 20 yards, I'm going to hit that thing.
*  Yeah, it's like a quarterback.
*  A quarterbacks, I know a couple of my buddies, college quarterbacks.
*  They're all good trad archers because they kind of had that hand
*  eyes, spatial, they know the memory.
*  Yeah, but you got to be on.
*  Yeah, my buddy got into a Brandon Lilly powerlifter.
*  He got into it and he only hunted with for a couple of years is trad.
*  And that cat went like Argentina and Africa just nuts in a sack with it.
*  He's like, no, I'm going to trad bow.
*  I'm like, OK, man, I'm always like, do you hate accuracy?
*  No, he got it done.
*  But holy cow.
*  Like, no, but there's something about dialing it into like 47 yards,
*  drawn back and center in your pan and just watching that shot break
*  and watch that arrow go exactly where you want to go.
*  And what and hit those ribs?
*  Just the dopamine button.
*  Oh, it's the greatest.
*  It is. It does. Can you see the air?
*  Does it slow down when you shoot at animals like it does for me?
*  It looks like there's no way this arrow is ever going to get to.
*  It's like everything in my brain.
*  It's like that book, The Rise of Superman, when you go into flow state
*  and everything speeds up in your brain.
*  So actually the person I would be the perception
*  all all lengthens out.
*  They say your brain actually starts firing three times faster.
*  The little pictures.
*  So that's why it slows down.
*  This morning, I watched that arrow just right hand to turn.
*  I'm like, that that deer is going to move.
*  And there's only 27 yards, but I'm watching it.
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  But when I'm shooting targets, I'm just like, man, whatever.
*  I don't seem to think that.
*  No, really. No.
*  I always think it takes forever to get to the animal.
*  No. I'm trying to think of when do things slow down for me?
*  No. Jiu-Jitsu.
*  No. Jiu-Jitsu just with when you're really in a good state,
*  it's just almost like you're not thinking.
*  It's like all of a sudden you have an arm bar.
*  It's like so it is a flow state.
*  Yeah, just complete flow state.
*  But it's a flow state that's established after, you know,
*  thousands of hours of drilling.
*  And that's the most important thing.
*  And Jiu-Jitsu really is drilling.
*  Everybody loves to roll because it's so fun, you know,
*  because it's like you're playing a video game.
*  You're trying to kill each other.
*  But the really important thing is drilling and drilling
*  with like a certain amount of rigor, like a certain amount of speed and intensity.
*  You know, you're not trying to hurt each other,
*  but you're drilling with like intention
*  so that your body is completely accustomed to these movements.
*  Like your your body recognizes these movements and like you slap that elbow,
*  grab that armpit, get that arm drag and you get the choke.
*  It's almost like it happens before you even know it's happening
*  because your brain is so just it's just wired in there.
*  Your your your your whole nervous system knows exactly what to do.
*  It's like a cascading effect like, yeah, then kind of deal.
*  Now, is that super slow drilling?
*  And then you just go to speed?
*  No, no, I think the correct way to drill is you drill with a little resistance
*  from your partner, like you don't want to put your partner to go limp on you.
*  Sure. But just a slight amount of like you have good partners,
*  a slight amount of resistance.
*  But then go through those motions with like a little bit of speed,
*  but not not like full blast. Sure.
*  But the whole idea is just get those numbers in.
*  Bam, bam, bam.
*  Eddie Bravo is the best explanation for this.
*  He says, you know, when you tie your shoe, you don't think about tying your shoe.
*  You just go, bing, and your shoe just ties.
*  Yep. Right. Because you tie your shoes every fucking day.
*  You know exactly how to tie your shoes.
*  Once you learn how to tie your shoes, it's bing.
*  He goes, that's what a jujitsu move is.
*  That's terrifying. It's like it just gets in there.
*  And you don't sometimes you don't know what's happening until it's happened.
*  Like all of a sudden you have a triangle like, whoa.
*  Like, shit. That was helpful.
*  Yeah. It's just it's just you've done it so many times that when someone overextends
*  or when someone gives up their neck or it's just cinches up,
*  it's just one of those things where your whole nervous system is just pre-programmed
*  to these very specific movements.
*  Yeah. So you've taken all these little close skills, which are replicatable
*  and then put them in an open format where like the if then scenario,
*  like the flow chart goes, go, go, go, go, no, go.
*  And the best guys are the guys that drill
*  constantly and then also study and take notes like like Gordon Ryan.
*  That's his belt. Oh, that's Gordon trains 365 days a year with 365 days a year.
*  And so he doesn't take any days off.
*  He doesn't. And he trains all fucking day long.
*  So if you want to beat him, good luck, because you have to catch those numbers.
*  You have to bypass those numbers somehow.
*  It's not like he's not talented.
*  It's not he's not intelligent.
*  It's not he's not physically strong.
*  So he's got all those attributes already. Right.
*  And then you have this insane work ethic along with dedication to technique.
*  Yes. And you'd have years or decades to catch up.
*  Exactly. You just can't.
*  And so there's too many guys in jujitsu that were just like big muscleheads
*  that would just like muscle a move and give a lot of grunt.
*  And you're never going to be the technique guy who's just as strong as you.
*  Right. If that uses less percentage of their power and everything to get the same job.
*  Also knows exactly where to be like, you know, you might not know exactly where to be,
*  because you've gotten away with a lot of stuff because you're big, you know,
*  because you're big and you're strong and you've pushed through stuff like,
*  like big guys on their back.
*  Like there's a lot of big guys, they get on their back and they become turtles.
*  They don't know what to do because they never get put on their back
*  because if they're training, if you're a guy who's 250 pounds
*  and you're in a normal jujitsu gym, what are the odds of the 250 pound guy there?
*  Most guys are 190, 200.
*  Maybe there's a 210. Right.
*  There's not a lot of really big guys.
*  But a 6'3, 250 this ain't happening.
*  It's rare. It's rare.
*  So you usually can push these guys onto their back and it's easier to do.
*  So you probably do that more often and you like smashing people.
*  So you smash all these people.
*  But the problem is, then you never develop a bottom game.
*  You never develop a guard.
*  You never develop ability to get out from under a big guy and do it technically.
*  You know, get that under hook, like, you know, work for a deep half,
*  like figure a way to get back up to your feet.
*  You're just always used to like overpowering people.
*  And then when someone's bigger than you, you're fucked.
*  Way. You're fucked.
*  So were you always strong?
*  Like I was always strong, but I didn't really start lifting weights
*  until I got into jujitsu. OK.
*  I mean, I always lifted a little bit of weights.
*  I worked out a little bit, but I was more into kickboxing than anything.
*  But when I started doing jujitsu, I was like, oh, being strong is like a big advantage.
*  Yeah, it's a huge advantage.
*  Yeah, which is interesting because I was watching this video
*  with these guys were talking about this, these wrestlers,
*  and they were saying that wrestling has always acknowledged
*  that power is really important.
*  But for some reason, jujitsu, they would like to pretend that it's not important,
*  that that technique is everything.
*  Was it cultural from where it was like with the Gracie's and would like?
*  I think technique is more important, right?
*  Because if a guy doesn't have technique and he has strength
*  and you have technique, you can beat him.
*  But you can't discount really f and strong. Right.
*  You also can't discount a guy who's really fucking strong with technique.
*  And they're not mutually exclusive.
*  No. Like a lot of guys who are really fucking strong also know how to grapple.
*  And that's a giant problem.
*  Now, is there like in the throws world, we always talk about like technique.
*  Speed is everything.
*  Explain to people what you're talking about.
*  Like, yes, I'm one of those nerdy guys that pick the sport.
*  That's like the least paying sport of all time.
*  I was a hammer thrower.
*  So it's like a shot put steel ball, 16 pound steel ball on a one meter,
*  three foot long wire.
*  So what do you see on the Olympics?
*  They spin around really, really fast and yell and scream
*  and always make like the highlight reels of guys that scream.
*  Where did that come from? Was that a weapon at one point?
*  Yeah. Yeah. So they actually in Scotland, they they would use it was a hammer.
*  They would literally have like for agrarian society
*  and they have a cylindrical head on it so they could use it every side.
*  And so that would that became a a way to train for battle
*  because they weren't allowed the Scottish weren't allowed to have weapons.
*  Yeah. So they would start throwing stones and the Braveheart days.
*  Yes. Or during those days.
*  So they weren't supposed to have weapons.
*  So they're like, F this, we're just going to take all the stuff we we have
*  and stay strong, stay ready.
*  And then actually their their stone was called the Clacknark,
*  which meant stone of strength.
*  What a great name. Wonderful name.
*  That's a Viking name. I've ever heard one.
*  Tell me how bad this is.
*  So like each family, like the Rogan family, like you're the patriarch, right?
*  You have your Clacknark up on the mantle or whatever it is.
*  So at your family outings, whatever outings those may be,
*  all the men very much like in Braveheart, they would go and throw it.
*  The first the guy who throws the Clacknark, the family stone, the fur.
*  This is kind of like the dude like he's like, all right, all right.
*  You now my son has surpassed me.
*  He's shown he's a man now. Right.
*  Here's the wildest part. This this gives me chills.
*  So they would if they went off to battle, they would take their Clacknark, their stone.
*  And on the way out of town, they would all put it in a pile.
*  And they're called out of this, called a can or a carn.
*  So they would put in a pile.
*  So if they did not return to battle, they had placed their own monument
*  to their town of their sacrifice.
*  Whoa. So could you imagine?
*  So when you go past these old towns and there's a pile, you're like
*  a lot of guys didn't come home.
*  And those piles are still there.
*  When I was in Scotland, they did say a lot of them are still there.
*  I was competing when I did Highland Games, Scottish Highland Games.
*  And it's wild. So like you think about you're like, man, you're literally
*  kind of placing your family's stone of like, I'm going off.
*  And if I don't show up like.
*  Dude, I was in Scotland last year and there was a part of Scotland.
*  God, I wish I could remember.
*  I'm not exactly up in the highlands, like a little something or another.
*  I went with some friends and they took us to this place
*  that my friend owns property out there.
*  And when we went there, there was a stone circle
*  that is way older than than Stonehenge.
*  No way. Yeah. And it's just sitting there.
*  So a lot of stuff in Scotland is just sitting there.
*  It's just sitting there in front of this dude's house.
*  And you can go and stand on it.
*  I was like, this is crazy.
*  And it's like a little monument on it.
*  No one's stopping you from like walking around on it.
*  And they're not big stones or small stones.
*  But this stone, they're like, I'm like, who made this?
*  I was asking the guy that we were with, it's pretty knowledgeable.
*  And it's like, no one knows.
*  It's just left laying around.
*  Yeah. So like Scotland. There you go.
*  No, that's not it.
*  But it's kind of like that. It wasn't nearly as high.
*  There were smaller standing stones.
*  And it was and there's a bunch of them like laying around.
*  Like there's a guide stone on the ground.
*  Like, how old is that?
*  Like, that's probably thousands of years old.
*  But nobody knows.
*  Like, they don't know who made the stone, put it there.
*  It's just a guide stone.
*  Like, so if you were on a trail through the Scottish Highlands,
*  you would find these rocks.
*  We're on the right place, love.
*  And this is fucking stone that's been there for 3000 years or whatever.
*  Like, they don't even know how old it is.
*  And it's just sitting there. So cool, though.
*  But it's a crazy thing.
*  It was like across the street from this guy's house.
*  So he's got this normal house and there's a little street
*  that across the street from his house is a stone circle.
*  It's like, who knows how fucking old?
*  Nope, it's not that either.
*  Yeah, they had like the other stones of strength there, the Inverstone.
*  They're older than Stonehenge and Scotland,
*  because all three of these I pulled up.
*  God damn.
*  How weird.
*  They're just really high. Maybe you're in actually England.
*  Oh, it's totally sober.
*  Look at that image right there.
*  How weird is that one? Cool.
*  The Ring of Brodgar.
*  How do you say that?
*  Brodgar? They have some sweet names over there too.
*  Brodgar. The Ring of Brodgar.
*  Like, what did they do in that ring?
*  How many goats died in that ring?
*  A lot of fights.
*  How many fucking people got sacrificed in that ring?
*  I mean, thousands and thousands of years ago.
*  So cool. The stones over there, like they a lot of people go over
*  to a lot of strongmen, they'll do like the stone tour.
*  So they'll lift all the they'll lift the Denny stones and the Inverstone.
*  And the Inverstone, I lift that.
*  That was in an old lady's garden.
*  Right. There's like a stone.
*  It's like a 200.
*  Yeah, it's like a 265 pound, like big egg stone.
*  And like just laying around.
*  It's literally in this lady's garden.
*  It's called the Inverstone.
*  And people go there.
*  People go there.
*  And ma'am, can I go lift your rock?
*  100 percent what happens.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, we were over there competing.
*  The US team, we were over there and like all the Highland Game guys were like,
*  let's go check this out.
*  And we all lifted it.
*  And she invited us in for tea.
*  She's like, well, we'll come and come and sign the book.
*  And you look in the book is like Bill Casmeyer was here.
*  So and so is here.
*  We're like, oh, my gosh, like the greatest strongmen in the world
*  had come as a pilgrimage to lift this stone.
*  And then they signed the book.
*  And they're like, so this is awesome.
*  And then across the street.
*  There it is.
*  Yeah, there. Yeah.
*  And then how do you say that word?
*  We call it the Inverstone.
*  Inver called.
*  Inver called stone.
*  Yeah, it seems like it's almost been like honed.
*  Well, that doesn't it seem like it was polished to the chip.
*  Oh, that one actually has numbers.
*  Yeah, that's the one I lifted.
*  It says six, 265 pounds.
*  And what it says.
*  Yeah. And so we lifted it.
*  And then actually, so what happened after back in the 80s
*  when Casmeyer was coming on the scene, you know, Bill Casmeyer, obviously
*  world's strongest man, kind of started the stage.
*  He allegedly picked it up.
*  You know, it was the man thing.
*  If you could pick up, he picked up and carried it across the street
*  and bellied up to the bar and laid it onto the bar and had a beer.
*  I'd be mad if that was my bar.
*  Right. Oh, he chipped the crap out of the bar.
*  It did. That was there.
*  I was like, that's where Bill chipped it.
*  This bad ass story.
*  I like that stuff.
*  So we traveled all around, lift all the stones.
*  It was cool. But anyway, a thrower is a person who decides to do a sport
*  that doesn't pay a lot. No, I'm just kidding.
*  But it's a shot put discus hammer javelin.
*  It was all those original Olympic sports that were all weapons.
*  And so I.
*  That'd be a good sport if you were a trans woman.
*  Oh, you would. Oh, you would dominate.
*  Oh, if I.
*  Regular chicks wouldn't have a chance.
*  Oh, I'm at 48 years old.
*  I could still throw the living crap out of a woman's implement if I wanted to.
*  It'd be a great move.
*  But yeah, it was a part of the track and field.
*  I got into it in college, kind of a weird forest gump like story.
*  And it changed the course of my life.
*  Have you done lift, run, shoot yet with Cam?
*  I haven't done it with Cam.
*  No, I've we played around and done some stuff like that at my farm.
*  You know, during.
*  You should do his his podcast, the lift, run, shoot show.
*  That'd be great.
*  It makes you carry a rock up the fucking mountain.
*  I went up Pisco with him.
*  I haven't carried the rock.
*  And but I'm sure you've done so.
*  Like the Cam Rock.
*  I haven't done Pisco. I'm not doing that.
*  Fuck out of here.
*  That was rough. Yeah.
*  That was rough. I started running.
*  I'm not a big cardio guy.
*  I just didn't go anywhere where that guy's running.
*  Dude, he is he is as advertised as a badass.
*  Like he's a complete psychopath.
*  Legit. He's one of my best friends.
*  He's a complete psychopath.
*  We did. We're we all got running and then he kind of left me.
*  And then like he got to the top and then did his dance.
*  And then he came back down and like, hey, man.
*  And it was very remarkable.
*  Like he goes, all right, why do I do this all the time?
*  He goes, if we crested this corner right now
*  and you saw the biggest pull of your life at 70 yards, could you make the shot?
*  And I'm like, bro, I'm looking on my ear hole right now.
*  Like I'm screwed.
*  Yes, that's why I do this every day.
*  I'm like, yeah, I'm tracking.
*  He's also addicted to exercise.
*  He's addicted to cardio.
*  Yeah, I think me not so much a state of mind that a lot of those distance
*  runners get in that they get really, really addicted to.
*  And there's a runner's high like the runner.
*  You experience that? Oh, yeah, for sure.
*  Yeah. Long cardio sessions. Yeah.
*  I never have. I've tried it.
*  And then I just either get bored or mad at cardio.
*  Then I go and lift weights and throw.
*  You've got like that power strength throwing background.
*  You know, it's like it doesn't really benefit you to be really into cardio.
*  It actually probably would diminish some of your strength.
*  Like heavily. Yeah.
*  Greg Glassman back in 07 when I was throwing Highland Games, he was like,
*  you got to do cardio or do a CrossFit.
*  And I was like, why?
*  And he was like, no, it'll help your throwing.
*  I go, oh, the CrossFit guy. Yeah.
*  Doesn't look like it works out at all.
*  That's the one. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I'm not taking advice from you, but I was sitting there.
*  I was like, 265 pounds.
*  He's like, you should do CrossFit.
*  And I'm like, I'm trying to be the best thrower in the world.
*  And that has nothing to do with any of this other stuff.
*  Yeah. I have a golden rule when it comes to taking advice.
*  I don't take advice from anybody who looks like shit.
*  That's sound. That's sound advice.
*  If you look like shit, I'm not taking advice.
*  I know you had like some physical problems, right? Yeah.
*  Something's wrong with them or something.
*  But the bottom line is unknown and unknowable was not my sport.
*  My sport was extremely known and extremely knowable.
*  I know the Olympic trials are on this day and I need to show up.
*  Yeah. But they're really far.
*  And also, if you want to be a power lifter or if you want to do some
*  just completely power focused exercise, correct.
*  It does not benefit you to spend time getting in extreme cardiovascular shape.
*  Like you do need to do what kind of running the cam does. Yeah.
*  And it's not even not beneficial. It's detrimental. Right.
*  I mean, we would joke like why run when you could walk?
*  Why walk when you could sit down and why sit down when you could lay down?
*  Like as throwers, that was what we would do.
*  And we would lay down every chance and eat every chance you get.
*  And they're like, I'm going to stand up and do something really hard
*  and fast for three seconds.
*  I'm going to go rest for a while. Yeah. Call me when I'm back up.
*  Yeah. I mean, there's different different things of different requirements.
*  But if you want to be a mountain elk hunter, what he does is very beneficial.
*  I just can't run.
*  I have a bad left knee that's been really bothering me the last few years.
*  And I just twisted it again this September.
*  Yeah. You're saying your sciatica was a little tweaked.
*  That was another problem.
*  That was from overuse of now. It's just being stupid.
*  That's overuse of archery.
*  So I was. Yeah. Because, you know, I have two bows.
*  I have a bow that's 84 pounds and a bow that's 90 pounds.
*  So I'm pulling these 90 pound bows 100 times a day.
*  Are you sure? How many times a day? Oh, yeah. Good for you.
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, you have to.
*  For that moment, when like a fucking giant bull walks in between the trees
*  and you have a 70 yard shot, you have to 100 percent be confident
*  that you can make that shot.
*  And so I'm shooting at 84 yards over and over and over and over.
*  And I'm obsessive.
*  But the problem was I developed like tendonitis in my lower back.
*  So it's overuse from the stabilizing from like holding yourself.
*  So it's the pulling.
*  I'm sure that's it.
*  But it's also holding it right there in that position.
*  And it's all in my right lower back.
*  But it's much, much better now.
*  I started doing this thing called New Fit.
*  OK, talked about it the other day with Derek,
*  where they're doing electrical muscular stimulation
*  while you go through exercises.
*  It's really helpful. Really? Yeah.
*  It's been three weeks like a microcurrent or more like it juices you up.
*  Like all the all the muscles contract like stem kind of thing.
*  Yeah. But it's very strong.
*  So this is and you can crank up the intensity.
*  So this is some of the shit like you saw Mike Tyson
*  when he was training for Jake Paul, he was doing that.
*  Like what I think it's really good for.
*  I don't know if it's good for a lot of these things,
*  but it's really good for rehabilitation. Sure.
*  For rehabilitation, I think there's tremendous benefits to it.
*  And I bet there's some benefits for athletes for working on specific things
*  and doing it while you're getting juiced up.
*  But for me, it's been it's helped me quite a bit
*  pretty quickly to like three weeks later.
*  That specific spot or they firing something else?
*  No, that's firing a lot of different parts of your back.
*  So it's like both sides of my back, my obliques, my core,
*  and just going through a bunch of rotational exercises
*  and a bunch of different things, strength and lower back and just,
*  you know, you're getting a lot of blood flow through there and stretching it.
*  And it's it just was I was getting pain.
*  And I was like, shut up, pussy.
*  And I would just ignore the pain. And then it just got bad.
*  It got bad to the point where my hips were getting kind of numb.
*  And when I was hiking up hills, like in October,
*  when I was hunting in October, it was bothering me a lot.
*  I was like, OK, I've got to really do something about.
*  Yeah, because you could be, you know, talk yourself in or out of something
*  really hard. But if it's something that's just going to be chronic, like, well,
*  I'm turning it chronic. Yeah, it's a lot better now.
*  It's a lot better now. And it's only been three weeks.
*  Oh, that's great. Yeah.
*  My knee is still fucked, but not totally.
*  It's mostly soft tissue.
*  It just I twisted it.
*  I twisted it crossing
*  like slippery ground in in September.
*  And I've had a lot of problems with it.
*  I've had two knee surgeries.
*  I had my ACL reconstructed.
*  I had a meniscus piece removed.
*  And then when I was skiing the last time I skied, last and final time
*  I ever ski, this lady didn't know how to ski.
*  She like slid into the trail and I had to try to not wipe out,
*  not not hit her rather.
*  And I wiped out and I got what's called the insufficiency fracture.
*  So it's the bone fractured at the top of my shin, my fibula
*  or my tibia rather right where the cartilage is.
*  And so, yeah, that created quite a bit of pain.
*  And then I twisted it again one time when I was about to get on stage.
*  It's hard when I play at Stubbs.
*  I was going to Stubbs, which is like this outside concert venue.
*  And I was looking at my phone to turn my voice recorder on so I could record.
*  And as I was doing that, I twisted my knee on this concrete step,
*  just yank the shit out of it to the point where my leg was shaking
*  while I was on stage, so I was in pain.
*  I look like I was super nervous, but it's really just pain.
*  Because I think at this point, you get super nervous on stage
*  when you're talking. No, once I'm up there, I'm not nervous at all.
*  But you still get nervous beforehand.
*  I get excited.
*  Yes. I think anything you do that you really care about, you should get excited.
*  Yeah, I used to call it my national leg when I would go to
*  national championships in the hammer all year.
*  I'd be fine.
*  And when I would wind the hammer on the first one, when I took the hammer back,
*  my right leg would bounce and I'm like, oh, there it is.
*  It was one throw a year and I was like, here we go.
*  We're back. They just had adrenaline.
*  Oh, it was adrenaline.
*  Because when you're in your physically, you're peeking for it.
*  You're like, this is the day I have to compete.
*  You know how it was.
*  But you're like, this is the day.
*  And like everything else is kind of work.
*  And then you're like, I'm cashing out today.
*  I get to cash out today.
*  Like I get to like and then it's like, oh, that's the best.
*  Yeah. That's the best.
*  Doing exciting things is really fun.
*  And it's so important for you to grow as a human.
*  Do something that scares the shit out of you.
*  Do something that excites you. Do something that's difficult.
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And it's almost I don't know.
*  Sometimes it's good when it's more dynamic where you don't know when it's going to happen.
*  But but looking forward to something is pretty bad ass, too,
*  because then you could start focusing training, focusing efforts and then going through like
*  almost stages of guilt, the stages of excitement.
*  And you're like, OK, am I excited? No, I got this one.
*  Don't go back and forth. Yeah.
*  Let's go. It's live. Yeah.
*  That's what it is with everything.
*  I mean, I think it's these processes of like recognizing there's a goal,
*  working towards it, solving problems, working hard, pushing yourself through discipline.
*  That's how you grow. And it's like that.
*  That's how everything grows. Right.
*  This is how your mind grows.
*  This is how your body grows.
*  This is how your life grows.
*  Like you have to do stuff that's hard.
*  And then you get better at doing stuff that's hard.
*  And that's how you get better.
*  Yeah. And then you level up in this next wilderness.
*  You're like, all right, well, what's the next thing?
*  When that alarm clock goes off, it's so hard to know that.
*  You know all these things, but you're the force of the bed,
*  the gravity of that warm bed.
*  It's cold in the room. Oh, especially like shout out to people who live in like Alaska.
*  Oh, they have to get out of bed.
*  Dude, fuck.
*  I'm sure you've done some some hunts where, you know, you're in a tent or something.
*  Oh, yeah. And then you're like, I know I really want to get out there, but oh, my.
*  This here, like my boots are frozen and like,
*  maybe that bull will just kind of walk more this way.
*  First time I ever did was Steve Rinell in Montana.
*  Oh, yeah, I remember seeing that.
*  It was nine degrees, nine degrees in the morning.
*  We're just like, Jesus Christ, so cold.
*  That was the hunt that started it all for you.
*  Yes. Little forky kind of buck for whatever.
*  Right there. No, OK. That's the buck.
*  Oh, no way. Yeah. That's the first buck I ever shot.
*  That's awesome. That's him.
*  Yeah. That the the buck that launched a thousand hunting careers.
*  Well, it was a life changing experience.
*  But you know, one of those things where, you know, you realize like, wow,
*  where would we be without houses?
*  And it was only by the way, it was only I think October.
*  It was October 2012.
*  I'm pretty sure it was October and it was already nine degrees in Montana.
*  Like, what was it like in February for these poor fucks?
*  Oh, it's January like in the morning and you're in a tent.
*  Bro. Well, it's like Josh Smith up there at MKC has talked about.
*  I was like, yeah, everyone loves Yellowstone.
*  Y'all about to find out.
*  February is like everyone wants to move here.
*  He goes, stick around.
*  It's going to get live here in about January or February.
*  How many people got super confused by that show and bought a house there?
*  And they're like, what is this?
*  Why is the ground solid?
*  Exactly. Oh, I love it.
*  It's like, this is fantastic.
*  Especially someone who's never lived in the real north before.
*  You don't know what happens when your ground freezes.
*  The ground is a piece of rock.
*  Like, so if you're full on it, freezes like everything freezes.
*  Yeah, that's a that's a whole different animal.
*  It's a different way to live. That's for sure.
*  But, you know, I was talking
*  with this gentleman yesterday, Rick Strassman, a scientist.
*  But we were we were talking about the time where he was living in Alaska
*  and he was living in Alaska and he lived in Southern California.
*  And then he moved to Fairbanks, where it's 39 degrees below zero.
*  And he's like, what the hell?
*  And then it's dark for like 10 hours.
*  Everyone's depressed. Yeah.
*  Vitamin D, we're not dark for 10 hours, rather.
*  It's it's only light for four hours.
*  It's light for four hours. So it's dark for 20 hours.
*  Yeah. Fuck that.
*  Have you been to Alaska a lot, I would think you like it.
*  I like the people up there.
*  They're hardy.
*  They're different kind of human. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I was in a battle tested.
*  They are. And everyone wears extra tough boots.
*  Yeah. You don't want to get caught outside with some fucking bullshit.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And if your boots are too clean, you get made fun of openly.
*  They're like, hey, nice new extra tough.
*  Cool. You know, your friends are Tyler from Archie Country.
*  Tyler's always walking around everywhere with flip flops.
*  That guy hunted yesterday in shorts. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. He's a different kind of killed a deer in shorts.
*  If you're in Alaska and you have flip flops, you're going to die.
*  You're going to your feet are freeze off.
*  You're going to have no feet. Yeah.
*  Like you. Yeah. I was out at a bar out there.
*  We were in Homer, Alaska, and we were playing pool and jacking around.
*  Where's Homer? Homer is they have this big spit that comes out.
*  I don't know. It's in Alaska somewhere. How far up there?
*  Far.
*  It's all far. It's big, man.
*  I don't know. When you see how big it is and you lay it over the country.
*  Jamie, where's Homer?
*  How much we stole from the Russians. Of course, you'd have that.
*  Yes, there it is.
*  So we were. Yeah. Damn, Alaska is big.
*  It's so cool, isn't it?
*  So we're on that big spit.
*  So we were on that bay, which is crazy.
*  And yeah, so we're down there.
*  And we were at a bar goofing around.
*  And I remember I walked into the bathroom and I was like,
*  I just kind of noticed I was like, there's no mirror on the wall, whatever.
*  It's like, oh, that's kind of interesting.
*  And one of the guys is like, yeah, there's no mirrors in the bathrooms
*  in Alaska because it doesn't matter what you look like.
*  You better just be capable or you're going to die.
*  And I was like, what a cool place.
*  Like he's just like, no one cares what you look like here.
*  Is everyone's hair is all frode out and they dirty and oily and greasy.
*  So yeah, that's that's the flex here.
*  If you can make it, that's interesting.
*  Yeah, it was like, oh, what a cool.
*  But yeah, we were sitting in that bay
*  looking across the bay
*  with a pair of spotters and looking at tracks and seeing animals
*  across the bay, like 19 miles away.
*  It was crazy on that white snow.
*  It was wild. I never thought you could see that far of a spotting scope.
*  No, how much magnification is 90?
*  Oh, wow. Yeah, some monsters.
*  But still, it's like, yeah, a big swarrow that you can see, you know,
*  all of Elon's stuff up in space with probably imagine those poor fools
*  that had to hunt with traditional bows, no binos, no spotting scopes.
*  Dude, did anything? No wind checker.
*  No, no, no, no apps.
*  I have apps. I have everything.
*  Oh, yeah. I have a rangefinder that syncs up with my app.
*  Of course you do.
*  My I haven't even set it up yet.
*  But it's not out on all this stuff like I do.
*  So here's the problem.
*  I have a loophole rangefinder.
*  I really like loopholes. Full draw.
*  Yep. The reason why I like it is because it'll show you the arc of your ass.
*  That's how nerdy it is, folks.
*  So my arrows go 294 feet per second.
*  OK, how heavy there?
*  These are 475, 475 grains.
*  And you calculate all this stuff.
*  You put all this stuff into the rangefinder and the rangefinder knows
*  exactly how heavy your arrow is, exactly what the peak of it's going to be
*  as it comes off your bow, how fast it's going.
*  And it gives you a line.
*  So that line.
*  So if I'm shooting through a gap in some trees and I actually did
*  this a couple of years ago, I actually did it when I had a Garmin rangefinder.
*  Right. So the Garmin is a rangefinding site, which is pretty bad ass.
*  I've always wanted to play with it.
*  Kept fucking up, though.
*  And apparently they're getting better, but they they fucked me a couple of times.
*  And it would fuck me on my range.
*  Like I would be at full drama range.
*  And I know it's 84 yards and I press the button and I'm not getting a range.
*  And I press the button again.
*  So you would press the button and it would give you a red dot. Right.
*  When it works, it's the greatest thing of all time, because it's like a pistol.
*  Like you see that red dot, that clear lens and then that dot.
*  It's the best site picture of all time, of all time.
*  Yeah. Everything else, like the post or the side.
*  They get a little in the way just to touch.
*  Not not bad. I can deal with it, you know.
*  But that red dot was fucking amazing.
*  So I shot this.
*  I'll show you the bull afterwards.
*  I shot this big bull and he was coming through this gap.
*  And I wasn't sure if the arrow was going to make it there.
*  So I pulled out the second range finder and I clicked on that.
*  And I got the height of the arrow.
*  I knew I could make it.
*  And then I used the range finding site.
*  So a man that knows his tools, the opposite of these guys with their traditional bow.
*  Point. Yeah. Like, you know, I'm using technology.
*  Sure. So the new loophole, though, the problem is it doesn't have this
*  this height thing in it.
*  But the new one, when you range an animal with on X hunt,
*  so you arrange the animal and it puts a pin down where that animal is.
*  Yeah, I actually had the.
*  I was one of the test subjects for that.
*  They said, yeah, probably two years ago, I was hunting at Deseret with it
*  giving them feedback.
*  We found a mule deer the day before and I ranged him, marked him.
*  And we went back the next day and I shot him at 14 yards.
*  That's crazy. It was awesome.
*  That's crazy, because you can go back to the actual spot where he was.
*  Yeah. It threw it off to my phone and is like the I can't remember what it's called.
*  The range, but it has like the L.F.
*  Something five hundred five hundred. Yeah, something like that.
*  You find it, Jamie. Yeah, it's pretty dope. It's super cool.
*  I love loophole shit.
*  I just wish their glass was as good as Swarovski's.
*  Yeah, everybody. I say that about every like vortex makes awesome binos
*  for the money. You can't beat them, especially their HDX series.
*  Those are the really high end ones.
*  Those are fucking great until you put it through the pick up those
*  and help yours and you like. Yeah, you're like.
*  It's so it's almost like I wish I never looked through.
*  Oh, that's yeah, that's the RX 5000.
*  That thing is bad. It's pretty dope.
*  So it does. It syncs up with your onyx hunt.
*  So you could show show you how it works there.
*  So what's really good about that is not just, you know,
*  you know where you hit the you know where the animal is.
*  So if you have to go around somewhere and get back to him,
*  you'll you'll be able to get right to, you know, if you're trying to get away
*  from the wind. Well, the spot in stock is so nice
*  because we were hunting mule deer in Arizona and you could.
*  Same thing. You're you're circling around and your depth of perception.
*  You know, I've been 200 yards off.
*  I feel like this is more designed, though, for the rifle hunter.
*  And this is like even they're even showing guys
*  like going 2000 yards with this thing.
*  I feel like for the bow hunter, they just need to add that.
*  Maybe it'll just make it too big.
*  But add that height of arrow technology.
*  I don't know why they wouldn't put that in there.
*  Yeah, because I can't use it.
*  I need that. That that is so that is elk hunting.
*  Yeah. For me, it's like gaps or everything.
*  I want to be able to be sneaky and just make my way around a tree.
*  Just give me this. Give me this much.
*  And if it's and if I know that the arrow is never going to hit the top or the bottom,
*  I'm golden and I have full confidence because otherwise it's a mind fuck.
*  Because I'm sure you've had arrows hit branches. Oh, yeah.
*  It sucks so hard when you whack.
*  Yeah. You're learning in Cleveland somewhere a few years back in Utah.
*  Here's their ones for that one.
*  I had pulled up had I was he's he was made for ballistic for I think this morning.
*  These are all for archery.
*  Yes. The foot well, the TBR. So the right.
*  Yeah, that that is that one is a similar one.
*  That was like.
*  I don't think that's as sophisticated, though, and I don't think that has the app.
*  I think the RX one is the only one the app, but I have that one, the full draw five.
*  I don't go anywhere without that.
*  It's the shit that that is to me.
*  I have I've had a bunch of different ones that were really cool.
*  Like Aaron Schneider turned me on to this Nikon a while back that was
*  image stabilizing. That was a game changer.
*  That was that's a big deal because you could really like
*  get a range on the animal.
*  Yeah. Image stabilizing range finder.
*  Yeah, I use image stabilizing binoculars.
*  Have you used those SIG ones?
*  I've used cams. I tried that.
*  Those things. Pretty dope.
*  I'm running 16s.
*  Yeah. All right.
*  Because you could just hold them.
*  Because you just hold.
*  I mean, I have I've run Swarovs since 1999
*  and I started leaving mine at home because I like the SIG so much.
*  And they did the new HD.
*  So it has a better glass.
*  Now, still nice clear. It's Swarovs.
*  I mean, that's just.
*  But because you could stabilize, I could run 16s and I'll run 16s in the woods
*  because I could just peer through everything and like boom.
*  I ran 12s in the woods this year, which is a little too much
*  when you when you're not stabilized.
*  I usually run tens, but I like sometimes.
*  Ten by 42s. Yeah.
*  Sometimes when you're looking at something that's really far off,
*  you're like, I don't know if that's a good bull.
*  Is that worth chasing?
*  Yeah. The 12s make all the difference in the world.
*  But what I do is I grab my baseball hat.
*  I learned this trick from Remy Warren.
*  Oh, that's a good idea.
*  So what you do is you.
*  Remy's a killing son of a gun.
*  I use a killing son of a mother.
*  You clip that sucker down tight.
*  So your hat's on tight.
*  And then I'll do this.
*  Oh, hold my binos right here or take my bow and put it here.
*  And then stack it on top of the bow.
*  Press the bow up against your chest.
*  So it's not going to go anywhere.
*  And then stack it on top of the cam of the bow.
*  A lot of guys do that. Sure.
*  But Remy taught me this one.
*  And I think this one's super legit.
*  Just hold on your ass to you.
*  You can get your you could tuck your elbows in like this
*  and you can really keep it stable.
*  If I couldn't do that, I wouldn't use 12s.
*  But I don't think I'm going to use 12s anymore anyway. Really?
*  No, I think tens are the way to go.
*  Maybe even eight because you get a bigger field of view.
*  Yeah, because a lot of times I'm seeing stuff through trees
*  and I'm sneaking around like I like to.
*  You know, I'm a big spot and stalk guy.
*  I've tried a bunch of different hunting.
*  I've tried ground blind.
*  I tree stand hunted with Dudley.
*  That you can go fuck yourself with that.
*  Sitting in those trees all day.
*  Fuck that. I am way too ADHD for that.
*  You'll find out if you're crazy.
*  Oh, I'm crazy. Yeah, I'm definitely crazy.
*  Yeah, I don't like it.
*  I don't like being up there in a tree like that.
*  Here's my question, though.
*  I was just in Missouri. I went to our farm.
*  I was there six or seven days and we sit
*  30 minutes before to 30 minutes all day.
*  Yeah, you have to.
*  So is. But I would think with as many people as popping on you
*  and all this like it was nice because for me, I'm like, I'm quiet.
*  I could just be.
*  I enjoy I enjoy that part where I could just unravel and think
*  like think through problems.
*  But yes, you go crazy and then you burn out your phone
*  because you're like, and I'm going to search for the dumbest things possible.
*  I'm going to buy socks.
*  100 percent.
*  You just sit in.
*  Also, you don't realize, like if it's 30 degrees out, like 30 degrees, no big deal.
*  You can walk around 30 degrees.
*  But as soon as you're sitting there, dude, and 30 degrees, you get so fucking cold.
*  You're not moving.
*  So you're not generating any heat at all.
*  So then you're in this stupid body warmer suit.
*  Oh, yeah. You're like in a big snuggie.
*  It's a big old oven in my hands right here.
*  But the problem with that is if a deer comes in, you got to
*  all the noise, you got to get out of it, all this movement, grab your bow.
*  So you really shouldn't do that.
*  So you try to go with a puffy, but you're still freezing.
*  So then I start doing Bruce Lee exercise while I'm up there and fucking.
*  One thing I realized, I I was so cold.
*  I had a hard time pulling my bow back once.
*  Yeah, I was going to shoot this deer and I was up in there.
*  And I was four or five hours. Yeah.
*  And I go to pull that bow back.
*  I'm like, Jesus. Well, because you shoot a 90 pound bow.
*  Yeah, but I was so cold.
*  Part of it. Yeah. Oh, no.
*  It's yeah. I'll sit there and just do like, you know, I had a 95 pound bow.
*  Oh, I remember when he made that one.
*  I couldn't draw it on my knees.
*  I had to stand up. You know how I found that out?
*  Because you could because I was on my knees right behind a bush
*  and an elk walk behind my fuck.
*  God damn it.
*  This is a weird spot to work only lean on my left leg to like.
*  So it was, you know, it was like I was on my knee, but I was even on my left knee.
*  It was like a fucked up. Right.
*  And you don't have a good. Yeah.
*  I was like my right knee was up like this.
*  My left knee was down there like this is bullshit.
*  That bow was crazy.
*  I remember when you text 540 grain arrows, 305 feet per second.
*  Bro, when it hits, it was just like, wow.
*  It was like I remember we were shooting at the Deseret
*  and we were all shooting at 100 yards, just me and a couple of these guys.
*  Yeah. And they shot first and then I shot.
*  And the guys go, what the fuck are you shooting?
*  Because the bow was so he was still rolling at that point.
*  He goes, that bow is so flat. What is that?
*  And I was like, this is a 95 pound bow.
*  It was the dumbest thing ever.
*  I remember you said to me, he was like, this thing's preposterous.
*  It was so dumb.
*  It also had a really short brace height, so it was super sketchy.
*  So if you moved your hand, it was so unforgiving
*  that if you move your hand even slightly, you were off target by six inches.
*  Oh, geez. Yeah.
*  Just really driving a little Tokyo drifter around.
*  It was so dangerous.
*  Not dangerous, really, but like you just wouldn't.
*  I wouldn't trust it.
*  You know, I killed a couple of animals with it and I stopped trusting.
*  Yeah. You get to put it on the wall and go.
*  Well, then I went to an 80 pound bow from Hoyt and I was like,
*  oh, my God, this is so much better.
*  It was like 15, 20 percent more accurate.
*  I was like, that thing is just too sketchy.
*  I just got that RX-9 like last week.
*  Oh, that's great. Yeah, it's I'm shooting 76, but I'm
*  30 and a half inches. I got a pretty good stroke on it.
*  Oh, yeah, man. Yeah.
*  I need some extra horsepower at 28 and a quarter.
*  I need like I'm shooting five
*  20 grain at about two eighty two.
*  So it's moving out. That's great.
*  That's the like guys like Randy Ulmer.
*  He likes two sixty five to two eighty.
*  Yeah. He thinks that like that's that's the range where the arrows are
*  like the most accurate.
*  There's this thing about having too much fucking whip.
*  Yeah. You know, there's too much and it's almost like too much flex on the arrow.
*  A lot of flex on the arrows.
*  And it's probably more subject to wind drift when they're flexing like that.
*  It's like we used to throw the javelin.
*  There was different rated javelins and you could be too strong for the jab.
*  And so if you don't pull through the tip perfectly, just like arrow spine. Right.
*  And so you have a 50, 50 meter jab, 60 meter jab, 70 meter.
*  And when you start getting strong, you could bend a 50 meter jab like a banana.
*  It's kind of fun, actually.
*  It comes out like Lamar from
*  like was it Revenge of the Nerds? Oh, OK.
*  But yeah, that makes sense that it would be just like arrows.
*  Yep. Because you got to folks at home, say if you have a 50 pound bow,
*  you could probably get away with a 320 green arrow, 330, 350.
*  So the higher the number, the more flexible the spine of the arrow is
*  and the lighter the arrow will be. Right.
*  So I shoot a 250.
*  So it's like like a nice, stiff kinetic energy.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Especially how much weight you have in the front creates that more of a flex.
*  Exactly. But it's to me, it's all about like I've heard arguments before.
*  Like people say, oh, you don't need that much bow power.
*  You don't shut your fucking dirty little skinny mouth
*  because the only reason why you would say that is because you can't pull that back.
*  That's the only reason.
*  And if you think that 70 pounds to you is the same as 70 pounds to me
*  and you don't work out, that's just dumb.
*  That doesn't make sense.
*  Yeah. It's like saying, well, you don't need a 500 pound deadlift to look.
*  Yeah, but it's nice.
*  Yeah. But if you can't squat 500 pounds and you have to squat 500 pounds,
*  you can't do it. I can.
*  So shut the fuck up.
*  It's nice to have in your pocket.
*  Shut your dirty little skinny hole.
*  Yeah. Because all that is is you're you're just saying there's virtue
*  in being physically weak. And that's stupid. That's stupid.
*  Do you need to be able to pull back 80 pounds to kill an elk?
*  No. If you can't pull back 80 pounds and you're really accurate with 60 pounds
*  and you have a cut on contact broadhead, you can be successful.
*  But I'm going through that whole animal.
*  Yeah, I'm getting a pass through on a giant animal and you're probably not going to.
*  Yeah. And I think that's it's more important to be able to have the most
*  ultimately lethal setup possible.
*  I learned this from Cam. He's my mentor.
*  He's the guy who taught me how to bow hunt.
*  And, you know, his whole thing is he shoots a 90 pound bow as well.
*  It's like the most amount of power.
*  And you want to make a big fucking hole.
*  Yes. And you want that animal to die like that.
*  Well, with anything, why would more horsepower, if you could handle it,
*  not be advantageous? It's stupid.
*  That's why race cars have limits on the amount of power you can have.
*  This is more advantage.
*  You know, if a Formula One driver has figured out a way to get a 4000 horsepower
*  engine and have it handle, they would win.
*  They would win. They would.
*  Or if you could punch 30 percent harder than everyone else in UFC.
*  Yeah. Do it. Yeah.
*  Literally, if Francis Hingano became the heavyweight champion of the world,
*  fuck it, it's harder than anybody.
*  Yeah, it's interesting.
*  My buddy, Lauren Landau, strength coach, and I was talking to him last week
*  and he did actually a study on
*  ground force power into into punching.
*  And they did. So they tested it on like a force plate jump and force plate.
*  And then they did a proteus machine.
*  Have you ever seen one of those?
*  They kind of like it's like you kind of throw it and push it kind of the same thing.
*  So they tested the power of the punch, then tested ground force.
*  And then they did squats, but they also did like a trap bar deadlift.
*  And then the training was a jammer arm, like a jammer arm punch.
*  So they had the sequence of force.
*  And he had a double digit increase of strength through the power
*  through the ground and equated to a 12 percent increase in punching power.
*  So almost almost percent for percent.
*  So you look at that and say, well,
*  if you're if you're stronger, you squat more or deadlift more now,
*  as long as it doesn't take away from the sport.
*  But that has a very, very real effect on punching power.
*  Yeah, it does.
*  The way it takes away from the sport is if you're sore from lifting weights,
*  you're not going to train as effectively.
*  That's just a fact.
*  Like, it takes too much time away from your technique or injury or that's
*  where steroids come in.
*  And that's why Gordon Ryan can train 365 days a year.
*  He's open about it. Like, he's open about his use.
*  Because they don't test for steroids in jujitsu.
*  So, you know, he's a wizard.
*  So he's like a pragmatist.
*  I figured that they would.
*  No UFC that they do, right?
*  Do you have to see that? Yeah.
*  But you ever seen Gordon? You're seeing. Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, yeah. It's that mother of a passing no test.
*  Give me a photo when I'm photos of Gordon.
*  Yeah, he's he's he's squared away.
*  Yeah. I mean, when you have that and then you have a genius level IQ
*  and then on top of that, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Fuck is pretty typical.
*  This big shit eating grid on his face.
*  And then you have a guy who trains 365 days a year who also works on technique
*  constantly. That's how you have the greatest of all time.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But by the way, all those guys like Galval, the guy was on the bottom there.
*  He's on the juice, too.
*  It's a level playing field. They're all juiced up. Right. Right.
*  It was kind of like the lifters and the throwers of the.
*  Yeah. Everyone had a 600 pound bench because that's what you do.
*  And guess what? You got to test now.
*  Well, this is a great argument to this idea of power being necessary,
*  like with jujitsu and grappling, you know, like if you have technique
*  like Gordon's and you're built like him.
*  Yeah. Giant advantage.
*  Giant advantage to be super strong always in all of life.
*  There's fucking zero advantage in being weak.
*  No, there's never a time you're like, you know what?
*  If I could just get my squat down a bit, that would really pan out for me.
*  One thing, though, that is really important.
*  This this actually really pays off.
*  If you can train with a guy who's small,
*  like if you can learn jujitsu with a guy who's small,
*  you'll learn the best jujitsu. Why is that?
*  Because they have to use technique.
*  They have to use leverage like you're a big fucking strong guy.
*  If you learn jujitsu, you you could use that strength.
*  You could squish people's necks and throw them on the ground
*  and grab their arms and stuff like that.
*  But a small guy can never do that.
*  So if you can learn jujitsu from like a Barrett Yoshida or a Hoyler
*  Gracie or Eddie Bravo or there's a few of those Gabe, Gabe Tuttle,
*  who teaches over here at 10th Planet.
*  Small guy jujitsu is the best jujitsu because it has to be razor sharp
*  because they don't have the physical strength, like overpowering arm
*  and get you into a certain position just from raw horsepower.
*  They have to like sneak it in there with leverage
*  and they have to do everything perfectly.
*  So those guys, if you learn jujitsu from them,
*  you're going to learn like the most technical jujitsu.
*  Is that like obviously a reason why you should learn younger
*  when you're small and weak?
*  Well, it's always good to learn young because, first of all,
*  it becomes a natural part of your movement.
*  Like it's like as your body matures, your body's been.
*  I think it's more important with striking than anything.
*  It's very rare that someone learns how to strike
*  while they're already physically mature and can ever reach the level
*  of like a Floyd Mayweather.
*  Right. Because that guy, as he was a child, his body, his reflexes
*  developed striking.
*  And he's just got this massive encyclopedia of information
*  that's available to him.
*  He knows exactly when he sees you do this, he knows that straight left is coming
*  and he knows all he has to do is do this.
*  And he knows the counter is going to be there
*  when you go to look for the right hand afterwards.
*  He's just got it all programmed.
*  It's like it's all just like right in there for you to build
*  that up after you're 28.
*  Like, yeah, you're going to be you're never going to be at his level.
*  Right. You kind of have to unless you're some physical freak,
*  which they do exist.
*  You know, yeah. But what I've understood, too, is the potential for building speed,
*  which is let's be honest, speed is a big part of power, which is punching.
*  Right. It's the sequence of force.
*  How do you create force to the ground explosion of force, not implosion
*  into your arm or your foot or whatever it is.
*  That ends at 22.
*  That the potential to develop the potential for speed is really.
*  Yeah, that's why all the weightlifters and everyone gymnast,
*  everyone has to start young.
*  So when you're firing patterns, 27 and you try, you'll never.
*  You won't reach the potential you could have genetically
*  because you just don't have this sequence, the speed.
*  Right. It's the I know how to do this at speed.
*  It goes whack, whack, whack through here.
*  And I could crack that whip. Yeah.
*  Your body just has it's done too many other things.
*  At lower speed.
*  And so, you know where I really noticed that with kicking?
*  You know, when I teach people kicking, there's certain things
*  that they have a really hard time doing fluidly.
*  You know, one of the force, the big ones is like anything that requires spinning.
*  Like if you look at a good MMA fighter
*  that doesn't have like a taekwondo background and you teach them
*  how to throw a wheel kick, they'll never be able to throw a wheel kick.
*  Like like a real taekwondo black belt.
*  There's certain guys that like as they're young,
*  they're developing these spinning techniques and they've got it wired in
*  their whole nervous system just and it's so smooth and fluid
*  that the power is so extraordinary.
*  And, you know, I've taught people that were like elite MMA fighters
*  and I try to teach them how to throw things like a spinning back kick, for instance.
*  And it it takes a long time for them.
*  Even like John Jones is one that he landed
*  like on steep a that that guy is a freak like that.
*  That guy is like what we're talking about.
*  Like you can. There's some guys you can teach them things when they're in their 30s
*  and they can develop it like someone has been doing it their whole life.
*  But that's that's a rare exception.
*  Another rare exception I was thinking was Alex Pereira.
*  Alex didn't really start striking until he was like 21 years old.
*  He didn't even start training.
*  But my question would be what other things that he do that
*  that exaggerate like like that developed that speed and power sequence?
*  Because like, you know what he did?
*  He worked in a tire shop. Really? Yeah.
*  So he's like hoisting tires and hammering tires down and setting wheels. Right.
*  So you're learning you're learning to do the most because if you're doing it for a job,
*  you're going to do the most efficient method possible to move an object. Right.
*  You're also going to get that tire up there to develop rotational strength.
*  Right. You're throwing hammers down.
*  I mean, he's doing this eight hours a day all day long.
*  So like think about how many tires he's hammered.
*  Right. Yeah. That's not a training.
*  Francis Mgano when he was a child worked in a sand mine.
*  So he's fucking digging sand all the time.
*  He just
*  thought he's just as he's developing.
*  I've also massive physical specimen. Right.
*  So he's like six, six or six, five, whatever he is.
*  265 natural built like a fucking Greek god, like a statue.
*  And his whole body is developing as he's a young man digging sand.
*  And the anger you have, I can't believe I have to dig this fucking.
*  It's like the wheel of pain.
*  Like, yeah, it is like Conan.
*  Yeah, he really is like a guy from a movie in a sand
*  and then becomes a heavyweight champion. The world was homeless.
*  Oh, yeah. His his. You ever heard his story?
*  Oh, yeah. So a buddy of mine, Bo Sandoval, used to run the
*  strength conditioning.
*  He was a conditioning director at UFC.
*  And so he told me about it years and years.
*  He's like, we got this guy.
*  And I was like, really? He goes, no, this is going to be a dude.
*  And I like, really?
*  And he told me his whole story about Cameron and like living in France
*  and the whole deal. And I became like I never even looked eyes on the guy.
*  I was like, this guy, he's my guy. I want to like I want to like him.
*  And then he came on the scene like, oh, his life story told on the podcast
*  about making his trek like he just decided he has to leave Cameroon.
*  And I was like, what are you going to do?
*  You can't go anywhere.
*  And he went through the fucking desert.
*  Yeah. All the way to Morocco and then gets in a raft and does it seven different times.
*  He gets arrested, gets taken into custody.
*  They bring him into the middle of the desert, drop him off.
*  He goes right back to Morocco, walks through, hitch his ride.
*  Took him a year and a half.
*  If he makes. I don't care how much money that guy makes.
*  It's not enough for just being able to do that.
*  Like, that is so, so.
*  How about he has one boxing fight?
*  He knocks down the heavyweight champion of the world,
*  one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time.
*  He hits him with a left hook and drops him and almost won.
*  Like, I thought he won the decision.
*  It was over. I was like, they're going to give it to him.
*  I think he won the decision.
*  He was battering him in the eighth round.
*  He dropped him in the second.
*  I'm like, I think he won.
*  That's and a lot of people thought he won.
*  Yeah. And he came that close, that fucking close.
*  And so is that like, obviously genetically super gifted.
*  Yeah. But then also, like we're talking about like shoveling and do all this work.
*  When you do that work for that long, you learn how to become efficient
*  because you don't want to spend extra time and effort doing stuff.
*  So you just learn how to kind of move stuff.
*  There's a little bit of that. And I think to be
*  to be really charitable, I think Tyson Fury probably didn't think that he had a chance.
*  I think Tyson Fury probably didn't train as hard as he would have trained
*  if he thought that Francis was a real threat. Right.
*  I think he probably thought that I'm going to box this guy's fucking face off.
*  How could this MMA fighter and then he gets hit with one of them hammers?
*  Yeah. So he's the terminator.
*  He gets left ducked in the side of his head.
*  He's like, what the fuck did this guy just hit me with?
*  And he's on his ass as the heavyweight champion of the world,
*  fighting a guy with zero professional fights.
*  That was his first ever pro fight, his second ever pro round.
*  And he drops one of the greatest heavyweights in the history of the game.
*  I think my here's my Mount Rushmore of heavyweight boxers.
*  Mike Tyson is number one.
*  Mike Tyson from 1986 to like 1990, there was not or whatever it was.
*  There was a few years before the wheels came off because he was just going crazy
*  and partying and fighting with syphilis and shit.
*  He was a maniac.
*  But that guy, the guy who knocked out like Michael Spinks,
*  the guy who knocked out Larry Holmes, the guy who won the title from Trevor Berbick.
*  I think that guy is the greatest heavyweight fighter of all time.
*  He was a juggernaut, man.
*  The guy who knocked out Marvis Frazier, that's the scariest version of Tyson ever.
*  The Marvis Frazier version.
*  But you could also like probably late high school.
*  Yes, I was like a little kid.
*  And I remember like walking out my skateboard and they're like,
*  you see Larry Holmes fight last night?
*  I was like, oh, no.
*  But I heard like 19 seconds or whatever.
*  It was crazy. It's all pumped.
*  No, the Larry Holmes fight went a few rounds differently than I did as a kid.
*  Yeah. Well, I was yeah, I was doing a little boxing myself and I was a giant boxing fan.
*  He was a freak.
*  He was a very unusual thing because every other heavyweight was kind of slow.
*  And if they could hit hard, they were lumbering.
*  He was bobbing and weaving and moving.
*  And he was a small, heavyweight, wasn't even six feet tall.
*  Yeah. So he's built like a brick shithouse.
*  He's got a 20 inch neck.
*  He's 220 pounds, moves like a guy who's 150.
*  And he's throwing lightning bolts at your central nervous system.
*  Just a blang.
*  He's hitting you to the body and your fucking legs are shutting off.
*  He was a monster.
*  I just think you can't maintain that forever.
*  And I think I always when I look at fighters, I try to look at them like when they were
*  when they were white hot, just burning hot at the highest level that they could achieve.
*  What was that like? Like, what was that?
*  I feel like as great as Muhammad Ali was, man, I just don't see him surviving.
*  I just not at the height.
*  No, no. I just I see like Henry Cooper
*  dropped Ali when he was back when he was Cassius Clay with a left hook.
*  And they cheated to get him out of the round.
*  Custom model cut his gloves.
*  So they had to take his glove off and replace the gloves.
*  They gave him all this recovery time.
*  You ever seen that Henry Cooper?
*  Henry Cooper was a bad man.
*  He was his British boxer, this guy from England who had a nasty left hook.
*  And he caught Cassius Clay just back.
*  Perfect one. It is like and he's like slumps down the ropes.
*  He was Dunsville, but it was at the end of the round.
*  And then Angelo Dundee mean that guy had been around the block.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He's got these fucking gloves.
*  See if you can find that, Jamie, because it's a it's a great
*  it's a crazy fork in the road in history, right?
*  Because if they don't cheat, likely he gets stopped.
*  Likely Henry Cooper, who landed the perfect left hook,
*  hit some of the couple more. Right. That's it.
*  He's done. He looks done already.
*  Like, watch this.
*  Henry Cooper had a nasty left hook.
*  Good bro.
*  Look how he's down there.
*  That's not regular down.
*  That's fucked up down.
*  That's like real trouble.
*  But it's the very end of the round.
*  Look at this, bro.
*  But look how he goes down.
*  That is Dunsville.
*  So that's a minute earlier.
*  If he gets hit with that, the whole thing changes.
*  Right. The whole thing changes.
*  He's not undefeated when he fights Sonny Liston.
*  He's not this unstoppable force.
*  Isn't that crazy? Crazy little.
*  And that can happen.
*  And there are fighters that I have seen in the UFC that I go,
*  this guy could be the next fill in the blank.
*  This guy could be the next great welterweight champion,
*  the next great lightweight champion.
*  And then they have one fight and in one fight something happens.
*  They get hit with a flying knee or they get head kicked or something happens.
*  And then their whole path changes.
*  And you're like, wow, if that guy wasn't overmatched,
*  if he didn't fight that guy.
*  So this is the difference between boxing and the UFC.
*  The UFC is like, when you're ready, come to us
*  and you're going to fight the best.
*  Wow. Boxing is like we're going to build you.
*  We're going to take you and you're going to fight a few guys
*  that are like real slick, but they don't have power.
*  And then you're going to fight a big guy with a lot of power,
*  but he doesn't have any endurance.
*  Yeah. And they're like, they're like, he's ready for this now.
*  You know, if you have a really good trainer like Tyson Fury's trainer, Sugar Hill,
*  he's going to like he's analyzing your movements.
*  He's breaking down things.
*  He's figuring out what to change, what not to change,
*  when to back you off a training like you're a little too hot right now.
*  It's like, oh, let's let's not peek too soon because we got two weeks before the fight.
*  Sure. I want you to take a day off.
*  I take a day off. I'm ready to fucking eat nails.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  No, we got to we got they know exactly.
*  And then they're like, he's ready for this level of competition.
*  So they'll give you a guy that'll offer you some struggles, some tests.
*  Maybe he's got a big, big punch.
*  And, you know, you might lose the fight, but you're most likely going to win.
*  And this is how you find out if a guy is going to make it slowly move.
*  So there's a lot of boxers, you know, by the time they're fighting for the title,
*  they're 14 and 0, 16, 18. Right. Charles Oliveira.
*  I mean, what is Charles Oliveira's record?
*  Let's let's see Charles Oliveira's record.
*  So Charles Oliveira, when he became the lightweight champion,
*  he had a ton of losses in the UFC.
*  He got stopped by Paul Felder.
*  He got stopped by Cub Swanson, KO'd him.
*  He got a I think I'm pretty sure Jim Miller kneebarred him.
*  So what is his record?
*  Jim's a freak. Look at that.
*  Thirty five and ten.
*  OK. And so out of those ten, a few of them
*  have been recently scroll back up to the top, please.
*  So the Islam Makacheff, he loses the title and then Armand Sarukian.
*  He loses a split decision.
*  I thought he won that fight, by the way.
*  But it was close.
*  So those are the two out of those tens.
*  So that means as a champion, he had eight fucking losses, eight losses.
*  And some of them brutal knockouts because you're in there with the Lions,
*  with all the Lions.
*  And so the UFC is like, who's the baddest lion?
*  Let's figure it out.
*  Like you want to be in the UFC.
*  You win a few fights.
*  We're going to throw you in.
*  Or if it's, you know, last short notice, short notice fight.
*  Let's go. And the thing you find out, too, is that the level at the UFC,
*  as great as some of these guys look in these other organizations,
*  the level at the UFC, that's the peak.
*  Those are the greatest fighters on the planet.
*  There's no arguing about it.
*  And we found out about that this past weekend
*  because Alexandre Pantoja, who might be the best pound for pound fighter alive,
*  he's the flyweight champion.
*  He fought this dude, Kai Asakura from Japan, who's a fucking assassin.
*  But Pantoja just ate him alive, just ate him alive.
*  And he got caught with a couple of good shots to a couple of good knees to the body.
*  And, you know, Kai Asakura is a really good fighter.
*  But the level is just different.
*  Like Pantoja just he strangled him.
*  But it's just the way he did it.
*  I mean, he was fucking him up on the feet.
*  He was fucking him up everywhere.
*  He was just pushing him in this like insane pace.
*  You watch those little guys fight like they can.
*  They fight like pit bulls, man.
*  Yeah, like just like wild scrambles where they're moving so fast.
*  You're trying to call the fight.
*  And it's like me and Daniel were talking about during the commentary,
*  like we have to recalibrate our brains.
*  Yeah, because you will go from a heavyweight fight to a flyweight fight.
*  Like, whoa, it's like listening to podcasts when you turn it to one point five.
*  Yeah. I actually had to start listening to your podcast.
*  At regular speed, because I was I thought you talked really fast.
*  It was just like, oh, Joe, no one talks that fast because I listened to it super fast.
*  Somebody sent me a clip of someone, some political person
*  talking about one of the guests on the show.
*  And I was like, what is wrong with the clip?
*  And then I had to realize, oh, they got it on speed it up.
*  Yeah. Do you listen to stuff speeded up? Never.
*  A buddy of mine taught me that he listens to books.
*  He got up to four four X.
*  And so he just downloads.
*  Are you absorbing it the same way?
*  I think if you're kind of like Rain Man, which I'm not, I'm not.
*  But I could go one five pretty easy and I could I could just get through it faster.
*  Yeah, I see how that could help.
*  But for me, I mean, I'm not doing reading the books on tape or listening
*  to books on tape for anything other than my own enjoyment and education.
*  So for me, I'm enjoying it.
*  Yeah. So I like to think about the things and I'll have more time
*  to think about what this person's saying if they're not going at one and a half speed,
*  because if they go in one and a half speed and go one concept to the next,
*  then I'm like, wait a minute, I don't understand what you're sure.
*  I have to back up. Yeah.
*  I like to think about stuff.
*  So it's like, especially if I'm listening to something esoteric or really weird.
*  Yeah. You know, which is a lot of the stuff that I listen to.
*  If I'm not listening to fiction, I'm probably listening to a book on physics or.
*  Yeah, I listen to Jack Carr stuff at regular speed because I really just enjoy the books.
*  Oh, that guy. What is his name?
*  Who's the guy who does his by?
*  He's really good. Yeah.
*  I can't remember. He has a lot of good dialects and everything.
*  Yeah. Jack text me this morning. He said hi.
*  He's the man. He's awesome.
*  I love that. You see where across Tom Hawks on the wall.
*  Oh, for sure. I love it.
*  He's like, hey, tell Joe I said hi. I love that, dude.
*  Yeah. He's salt of the earth.
*  Yeah, we just got him some C&B's.
*  Ray Porter, Ray Porter.
*  That Ray Porter. I knew it was a race across Tom Hawks on there.
*  He's the fucking man.
*  And the thing about his books on tape, though, is you're locked into Ray Porter forever.
*  Some new person starts reading like, who is this guy?
*  This is bullshit. Yeah.
*  You can't you can't have this guy doing it.
*  Guys, amazing. I'm used to all the voices.
*  I like Rafe is. Yeah.
*  South. Yeah.
*  You know, else is really good.
*  Who's the guy who does the Grey Man series?
*  There's a guy who does.
*  You ever listen to the Grey Man series?
*  I'm so addicted.
*  Mark Graney writes them. They're so ultraviolent.
*  They're so fucking crazy.
*  They're so crazy.
*  It's about a CIA hit man.
*  Oh, it was like a Singleton guy.
*  They send all around. Dude, it's so like they made a movie.
*  Is it like one of the weird ones who give you like you think about it all night?
*  Kind of like, oh, yeah.
*  When I would start watching the Sopranos, like my view on the world would change.
*  Jay Snyder, that guy is really good.
*  He does really good girl voices to it.
*  But those fucking books, man, they are so ultraviolent.
*  They're so crazy.
*  They're so crazy.
*  Sometimes I listen to them and I have to shut them off before I go to bed.
*  Like, if I listen to them, like I like to take the sauna before I go to bed.
*  And so if I'm listening to like, you know, a book on cosmology, that's great.
*  It's interesting.
*  Yeah, I think about space.
*  Very cool.
*  But if I'm listening to some Grey Man before I go to bed, I'm like, I have to shut this off.
*  Yeah, we don't need that.
*  You know, we don't need that in the house.
*  Yeah, people get in their fucking eyeballs, like a giant sword shoved through their eyeballs,
*  getting blown up, grenades in their mouth like, hey, hey, hey.
*  Hey, hey, hey.
*  Do you like scroll around?
*  You're not supposed to look at your phone before you go to bed.
*  I always just, I like look up ballistics.
*  My wife's like, what are you doing?
*  And I was like, she's like, that's good.
*  That's not social media.
*  That's good.
*  Well, I do it because I actually think about stuff and it doesn't matter.
*  I have to look at something that doesn't matter.
*  Like if I look at like a good, don't check an email.
*  You're screwed, right?
*  Like, and I'll tell my wife, she's like, hey, I got a question for you.
*  Like, the lights are off.
*  Don't ask questions right now.
*  Like I'll be all night.
*  I'll be thinking of this problem I have to solve.
*  Yeah.
*  So like, I'll just sit there.
*  I'm like, hey, I wonder what the ballistic coefficient of a 350 Remington magnum is.
*  By the way, anybody with a beard like yours, I would assume they know the ballistic coefficient
*  It's like, I see a dude in a beard like that.
*  He's kind of jacked.
*  I'm like, that guy knows how to shoot some things.
*  Just like, oh yeah.
*  So you would probably loads his own bullets.
*  Yeah, about a nine inch drop at 300.
*  Interesting.
*  Okay.
*  I'll keep that in mind.
*  Yeah, you probably load your own rounds.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you know.
*  Yeah.
*  I bet you do.
*  I get you going presses.
*  Pops used to be really, really into that.
*  Thankfully, I know the guys at NOSler.
*  So they just sent me an email, which is nice.
*  I've made the mistake of looking at social media before I go to bed and I get mad
*  or I get upset or I get sad or I find out some weird shit that's going on in the world.
*  And when I was younger, I'd read things that people would say about me and I'd be like,
*  oh my God, like, what was this asshole?
*  That's not true.
*  And you get all upset.
*  And then I realized like, wait, this is just some person.
*  Like I wouldn't talk to them in real life.
*  Like what do I get?
*  Why is their opinion more valid because it's written down?
*  So then I stopped reading all comments about me and oh my God, it changed everything.
*  Changed everything.
*  You do the post and ghost, right?
*  Yes.
*  It's the way to go.
*  Like I have friends and they'll come to me.
*  Like they'll come to the comedy club or something and they'll be like
*  genuinely emotionally distraught because people are attacking them online.
*  I go, but they're not here.
*  Like right here, your friends are here and you're all freaked out because I know I got
*  to stop reading that stuff.
*  I go, you got to stop reading that stuff.
*  First of all, it's not true.
*  You're really funny.
*  You're a great guy.
*  So it's all bullshit and they don't know you.
*  So they're just deciding to do this and they know that it fucks with you because you talk
*  openly about it.
*  And so now they're going to accentuate it.
*  They're going to, yeah, they're going to keep jabbing at you.
*  They got a rock.
*  There's a window.
*  Yeah, they're in the cheap seats for whipping in there.
*  You got to stop doing that, man.
*  And a few guys have listened to me and a few guys haven't.
*  And the guys have listened to me.
*  They all say the same thing.
*  Like, oh my God, I feel so much better.
*  I'm like, yeah, social media is not the problem.
*  The problem is either engaging in the anger and the hate or having reading people's anger
*  and hate towards you and having it fuck your head up.
*  Like, hey, do you think it's something that's like systemic that is literally spreading
*  and growing like the people that put that type of trash out all the time?
*  And then they think there's some sort of value to that.
*  And then other people see it.
*  There is some value, right?
*  They do get engagement, right?
*  And if you're a person that has like a YouTube show where all you do is shit on people,
*  you have bad karma for sure.
*  For sure, you're suffering.
*  Yeah, but you got to deal with that the rest of your life, like dealing that poison.
*  Right, but you can make a living doing that.
*  Like, there are guys who make a living doing that.
*  They're all fucked up.
*  I'm not saying there's value in it, but I do think you make something out.
*  You can create a career doing that.
*  That's part of the problem is that it's effective.
*  Right, like trolls.
*  Yeah, like it does get engagement.
*  But then, you know, what kind of engagement are you getting?
*  Look, I have people that hate me online, but not the ones who know me.
*  That's what's kind of important.
*  Yeah, the people that know me either in real life or through the podcast know I'm a nice person.
*  I work really hard at it.
*  Actually, I try hard to be a nice person.
*  It's a conscious effort.
*  I'm good at it.
*  I like doing it.
*  I like nice people.
*  Makes me feel good.
*  So I don't engage.
*  I don't fire back at people.
*  People get mad at me.
*  Even celebrities have attacked me online.
*  I'm like, eh.
*  How does that feel like probably being in that world a bit more and then now having
*  people turn on you probably feels strange?
*  They're just revealing who they are.
*  They're just weak.
*  They're just weak people.
*  They're not the type of person that if you did that in front of me when you were around me,
*  we could have a conversation about why I feel like you're incorrect.
*  And this assumption that you have of me is totally wrong.
*  And also, if you're not talking to someone in person and you're saying something about
*  that person, like you don't you can just kind of like form some bullshit narrative.
*  Of course, the person's right there.
*  They go, that's not true.
*  So you're saying something and if it was true, then you would be justified in your anger.
*  But what you're saying is not true.
*  And you're taking things completely out of context and you don't know what you're talking
*  about and you're doing this because your life sucks.
*  And it's the only time you do it.
*  I've always said, do you think Michael Jordan is posting on YouTube?
*  Is he making comments?
*  No.
*  When he was in, if YouTube was around when Michael Jordan was the king, would he be doing that?
*  No.
*  He doesn't have time because he's being a winner.
*  Because he's actually winning and doing, yeah, 100%.
*  Guarantee if Michael Jordan reads the comments.
*  And if he did read the comments, he would be up all night.
*  Anger.
*  You know, like you saw that that Neil Brennan had a bit about Michael Jordan's documentary
*  on his last Netflix special.
*  Pretty funny.
*  It's like unless you want to be the greatest basketball player of all time, he goes,
*  you don't hold grudges unless you want to have 150 million dollars with a passive income
*  every year because it's a fucking silhouette of you dunking.
*  Unless.
*  Unless.
*  It's a good unless.
*  But again, those are freaks, right?
*  These are the outliers.
*  These are the people like as a rule as a human being, that's not the way to go.
*  Just insatiable desire to like just hammer that nail until it's just so far down in the woods.
*  You're just like, I don't know what you're doing anymore.
*  But yeah, that's how you become the greatest of all time.
*  You leave no question.
*  It's just the difference between that in sport versus that in fighting, though,
*  is in fighting you could.
*  I don't think you can maintain it.
*  No.
*  Like a guy like Jordan.
*  How long was he in his prime?
*  It was a decade, right?
*  For a decade, he was dominating the basketball.
*  You can't really do that in fighting.
*  John Jones is the only one who's been able to do it.
*  You just take so much aggression, so much damage, so much damage to your body.
*  The damage to your body is huge because there's so much damage that happens just in training.
*  John tore his peck off of his fucking shoulder in training.
*  Yeah, and that wasn't getting hit.
*  That was wrestling.
*  And then there's the impacts that you get.
*  And then there's the back stuff.
*  You get thrown weird.
*  You land on your back weird.
*  You're throwing someone.
*  A knee hits you weird.
*  Your ribs break all the time.
*  Hands break all the time.
*  Like common gym injuries.
*  Knee blows out.
*  Noses.
*  Everybody's got a broken nose.
*  I don't know anybody who does any kind of combat sports that hasn't broken their nose.
*  After a while, you can't breathe out of your nose.
*  Your nose is destroyed.
*  Your fucking hand hurts when you try to open your car door.
*  You have to punch people in the head with it.
*  Your knee hurts going downstairs.
*  Kamaru Usman, you want to hear something crazy?
*  When he walks, he has to walk backwards downstairs because his knees are so bad.
*  Oh, because he can't get the knee over the toe.
*  His knee hurts so bad.
*  And he was a welterweight champion in the world with those knees.
*  And he was talking about it openly.
*  He was like, oh, you know, you can know.
*  You can know my knees are bad.
*  I'm still going to fuck you up.
*  And he did.
*  He fucked everybody up forever.
*  It's coming.
*  Until Leon Edwards.
*  But his knees are so bad that he would have to walk on the grass where everybody was like
*  walking on the sidewalk.
*  So you'd have to go over to walk on the grass because just take a little bit of relief.
*  Extra cushion.
*  Just something.
*  Jeez.
*  Yeah.
*  Bone on bone, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Bone on bone.
*  Like the operators, like, you know, guys are jumping out of.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Like all of them are jacked up.
*  All of them.
*  Everyone in the strength world, everyone's low back, everyone's shoulder, everyone's knee.
*  Everyone in Jiu Jitsu.
*  Everyone's got a back problem.
*  Everyone's got a neck problem.
*  It's part of it.
*  Everyone blows a knee out.
*  It's part of it.
*  Yeah.
*  And if, you know, Eddie always used to say, look, you're going to have to get surgery.
*  Eventually.
*  You're going to have to get surgery.
*  Just get the surgery.
*  Heal up.
*  Come back.
*  You're not going to stop.
*  Are we rebuilding this engine and keep erasing or is this like doing the least as you can to
*  not get surgery?
*  My second surgery, I went to this doctor and when I had a bucket handle meniscus tear,
*  so it would lock.
*  You ever have one of those where it locks out?
*  It was fucking brutal.
*  And he was like, you've got to stop doing martial arts.
*  I go, shut the fuck up.
*  I go, you know what you're talking about?
*  I go, fix this.
*  He's like, when you're older.
*  I'm like, yeah, when I'm older, like right now, I'm 30 years old.
*  Fix my fucking knee.
*  I got to go strangle people.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Yeah.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  Stop doing this.
*  I'm not going to stop doing this.
*  Same thing.
*  I was 22 when I had that and I had an Olympic trial in two years.
*  It's too much fun.
*  I was like, yeah, no, like no.
*  Before I went on, I was like, I've squatted this much and I do this.
*  When I come out of it, I expect to be back there.
*  So fix it like that.
*  Don't fix it like I'm an old guy taking her easy and like I'm young.
*  I got shit to do.
*  Do they fix it differently depending on like who you are?
*  I don't know.
*  I just felt better about saying that.
*  I'll tell you what, they do get, they got a lot better.
*  I would assume they would actually fix you.
*  Maybe they wouldn't fix normal.
*  Well, I tell everybody if you have an opportunity to get an ACL reconstruction,
*  please at least try the cadaver graft.
*  I know a lot of people want to do that patellar tendon graft
*  because you don't have the risk of rejection.
*  I don't know anybody who's had a rejection from the cadaver.
*  I do know people who have pushed it too hard, too early and then reblown it
*  because you know how it works.
*  Do you know what happens?
*  I'm not familiar.
*  It's really kind of interesting.
*  You get this.
*  So my right knee when I blew my ACL out, they take a cadaver.
*  Like I have a dead dude's Achilles tendon, which is much thicker.
*  I don't know his name.
*  I hope it was a guy like Francis Agata.
*  Yeah, you're like, oh, there's some stud.
*  Just fucking animal, just giant Viking dude.
*  So it's thicker than the, it's 150% stronger than a real ACL.
*  And so they screw that in place.
*  And then it's not like you have this dead guy's thing in there forever.
*  What happens is your body re-proliferates.
*  It acts as a scaffolding.
*  So it can feel like it's secure, but it's really vulnerable.
*  So you have to be super careful up until like that six month mark
*  when it should be re-proliferated.
*  And so does the foreign tissue eventually just kind of get reabsorbed, which is kind of weird?
*  Exactly.
*  You eat that dead guy's Achilles with your knee.
*  My knee is just munching these dead dudes.
*  But man, I've had no problems with this knee.
*  This right knee is amazing.
*  The left knee, I had a patellar tendon graft.
*  And because I had that one done in 93 or 94.
*  And that one back then, that's the only way they did it, but it was really good.
*  But it took a long time to heal.
*  Like it was a long time before I could kneel down on the ground.
*  Like if I had to kneel down and put my knees on the ground.
*  Because they take a piece of bone out of your shin.
*  And they take a piece of bone out of your kneecap.
*  And then they take a slice out of your patellar tendon.
*  They pull it off and they open you up like a fish.
*  And they fucking drill it into your shin bone and drill it into your fibula.
*  I love that.
*  Your tibia and your femur rather.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like wrap it over.
*  They get it in there.
*  A little drill.
*  It's like a year before it feels like you could do anything with it.
*  It took a while before I felt like I really trusted it.
*  But I do have to say I was not as diligent with my rehabilitation back then as I was
*  when I got this one done.
*  With this one I rehabbed it all myself.
*  I went to like one or two of these things.
*  I'm like they're just showing me things I already know how to do.
*  I'm like I know what to do.
*  I'm just going to do this.
*  I'm going to do it all day.
*  So I was doing bodyweight squats like all day long.
*  And I got it to six months later I was training again.
*  Full blast.
*  No problems.
*  Were you doing any like the BPCs or any of the peptides?
*  There was nothing available back then.
*  Oh well back then.
*  So this was 2003.
*  Okay.
*  That I got this one done.
*  Nice.
*  And this was the patellar tendon.
*  This was the cadaver rather.
*  How do you think the recovery would have worked for us?
*  Like with all these dings and injuries?
*  Because I've had a couple I'm sure you probably have too a couple friends that got surgery.
*  Actually the doctor hit him side injection and even IV with BPC one plus seven during
*  the reattachment of a pack or a bicep.
*  Super legit.
*  It's super legit along with TB 500.
*  Apparently that combination of those two together is the most effective.
*  Yeah.
*  Super effective.
*  And you know there's a lot of people that resist that for some strange reason.
*  Why?
*  I don't know.
*  I think there's a bit of ego involved in not knowing something when you're an expert.
*  I find that with there's a real problem with unfortunately some orthopedic surgeons.
*  Aaron Rodgers was explaining this to me that his doctors were telling him not to do stem
*  cells after he got his Achilles fixed.
*  He's like what are you talking about?
*  Yeah.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  So of course he did stem cells and of course he went to Ways to Well and of course he was
*  back three months earlier than they thought he could ever be.
*  Yeah.
*  You know there was like some real thought at the end of that season that he was
*  probably going to be able to play.
*  Yeah.
*  Where everybody's like this is nuts like nobody recovers from this that fast but he
*  was very smart and he didn't push it too far.
*  Yep.
*  And he waited and told us fully.
*  Actually followed Brigham and all the stuff.
*  But yeah stem cells work.
*  There's a reason why you have to go down to Tijuana to get the good ones because it's
*  fucking work.
*  And like anything that works is like you're not allowed to do it anymore.
*  Biden.
*  It is fucking really helping in 91 that cocksucker.
*  He really did.
*  I was talking to a strength conditioning professional the other day at the
*  administrative level and we were just talking about different things going on.
*  I said yes.
*  I said I you know I said there's people in my opinion in your world that they don't know
*  about BPC 157.
*  He didn't know about BPC and I'm just like crazy.
*  I'm like okay I was taking it eight years ago.
*  You know what it is though.
*  It's like they don't continue to learn.
*  That was my point.
*  And then they're in practice all day.
*  They're constantly working on people.
*  People are coming in the door.
*  I just got blew his ankle out.
*  This guy's got a blown shoulder.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But then I said the weird part is is you have a strength conditioning professional
*  and in some ways there's more information cutting edge on a podcast from guys that are
*  interested in training.
*  Right.
*  There are from like the you know and I'm like hey guys just open this the scope a little
*  bit like what is enough of these guys that are super smart and also jacked like these
*  Andrew Huberman guys.
*  Yeah.
*  And super smart guys that are in the bodybuilding world.
*  Sure.
*  Super smart guys like Derek from More Plates More Gates.
*  He's the best example because he's just a fucking encyclopedia of data and studies and
*  efficacy and what you're how you combine things together and he actually runs a clinic.
*  So he really knows what he's doing.
*  You get the boots on the ground.
*  You see it in real time.
*  My doc is Eric Serrano.
*  I don't know if you know Doc Serrano.
*  He's up in Columbus but you know everyone has gone to him over the last 30 years but
*  he's one of those dudes that has like a base Columbus Ohio.
*  That's where Louie was.
*  Exactly.
*  He was Louie's doctor.
*  So yeah he was he was Louie's.
*  You go through all professional baseballs like okay got it.
*  Tracking.
*  He's one of the rare guys that we went to him to do a podcast.
*  How was that?
*  It was awesome.
*  Did you go to Bob Evans with him?
*  No we just we hung out in his gym.
*  Yeah.
*  You know and he just was introduced me to a bunch of freaks and show me all the stuff
*  that he invented and why he invented it.
*  So cool.
*  Louie Simmons.
*  He was the fucking man.
*  He was so funny.
*  He was so funny.
*  He was such a character.
*  He was telling me about how he got his shoulder blown.
*  Got his shoulder replaced and then immediately when he got back to the gym they made him
*  max out and bench.
*  And I was like what are you talking about?
*  You need to recover.
*  It's like don't they were like don't be a pussy.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to max out.
*  Yeah.
*  I was there in 2002 and so Louie and his wife Doris and they would always you always meet
*  the Bob Evans in the morning and he would eat and like do the whole deal.
*  And he was telling me a story about how he had a he got he got pissed off and he could
*  something to his cell phone and he threw it out the window while he was driving.
*  Then so he didn't have a cell phone for a couple of weeks and then he got to the gym
*  and he missed a lift and he punched his own tooth out.
*  Punched himself so hard he knocked his own tooth out and then took a wire brush that
*  you like clean the chalk out of a barbell and smashed himself on the head.
*  He was just pouring his wife was like yeah Lou was pouring blood and he knocked the tooth
*  out and I'm just thinking West Side was awesome.
*  Holy crap.
*  So I got talking to him and he was like no biceps.
*  Yeah right because he blew him out.
*  It just never got fixed.
*  Yeah yeah a lot of those guys same yeah it's wild but he was like yeah those cats would
*  they'd fight and he goes we would literally like there's some some tuned up dudes in there.
*  And he said that we would just literally kick them out the door if they were fighting on the
*  floor we would kick them out of the way so they were out of the way of the monolith so we could
*  keep squatting like every 30 seconds you're up or 90 seconds whatever it's like I don't care if
*  you're fighting literally hitting each other with stuff move the next guy up and like this place is
*  wild.
*  They created some fucking animals.
*  Here's a wild story so we were there and this drunk chick came in she was like because this was
*  the old West Side that was like in this little shopping center with all the windows were all
*  blacked out and everything was pretty dope and this drunk chick walked and she's like hi y'all
*  working out here and she was tuned man she was like all sloppy like legit street person right
*  and I'm like oh this is going to go bad like I'm just I'm just reading the room right like
*  it was not a lot of estrogen in that room right so I'm like oh man this is going to be bad.
*  Lou's like hey come here come here come here so he puts a weight vest on her and then puts a
*  second weight but so 25 20 hours 50 pound weight vest and takes her outside wraps a belt around her
*  waist with a sled and had her walking doing sled pulls back and forth with a weight 50 pounds of
*  weight vest on her shoulders. Drunk. Drunk as shit.
*  I'm just like I'm just like watch I'm like what she comes back in he's like all right come over
*  here he puts her on the monolift two red bands like it's maybe just the bar wasn't a lot of
*  weight on that and had her doing speed box squats eight sets of two for speed and was teaching her
*  how to box squat. She finally stumbles out and just leaves and like later on I'm like Lou did
*  you know that girl he goes no I'm like she was just some random street person and you had her
*  squatting he goes shit half the people in this room were that person a year ago I'm like oh he
*  goes she could be world champion you never know. Wow. And I was just like that what that's what a
*  crazy mentality that stuck with me for so long he's like most of these people are broken and they
*  have some addictive thing and something and he goes if they could channel it into something that
*  might be the next world champion. Wow. And I don't know if you ever saw her again
*  or if I was just there that one day and it stuck with me for 22 years and I just thought about that
*  I'm like he put his money where his mouth was he was a coach and he wanted to see what could
*  what could someone do. You know that's so interesting because one of the guys who trained with Louie was
*  Matt the Immortal Brown. Matt the Immortal Brown I know he did some training with him and I've always
*  said that there's something about guys that used to be addicts that have like died and Matt died
*  and it's been a few guys that I know that they came back from that they were the scariest fucking
*  people because they had crossed over and then they realized there's a good addiction the good
*  addiction is to training. Yep. Just be completely addicted to training. Yeah. So those are some of
*  the fucking scariest dudes. It was wild I mean I know I know a lot of those guys from that world and
*  a lot of them are addicted to different stuff and unfortunately they get into training and then
*  if they get out of it it kind of that addiction might come back. Yeah that happens with fighters
*  when they retire and then also they're generally dealing with some issues mentally from impacts
*  you know and so a lot of those guys start drinking they start doing coke. I always loved how Louie
*  just saw it differently and my dad was the same way like he used to always say look for something
*  not of what it is but what it can be. Yeah. And that would that meant human potential that
*  meant designs that meant like application of stuff and it's just like yeah that person's
*  whatever but if you push and you tweak and you push and you tweak there might be something in
*  there that's like super beautiful and awesome but you never know if you just said that's a drunk
*  chick that walked in the gym. Well it's crazy with him because he's actually done it a bunch of times
*  and it worked. Right. Weird. So this attitude he's developed over time to just accept the fact that
*  this person might come in 16 cores lights deep. Dude just tuned. You know but you never know.
*  Buddy of mine he trained at Westside and he said I mean half the time he said there's he's like
*  I've seen guys bench 700 pounds like on acid like just freaked out of their mind. It's just like
*  wild stuff and I'm like holy cow like that whole world is wild. Yeah like you had an old I mean
*  that whole world like is so extreme right. The fighting world the lifting the throwing like
*  dudes who do some pretty wild stuff. Yeah. Well whenever you get like these male oriented alpha
*  characters that all get together and they're all butting heads and trying to figure out who's the
*  baddest motherfucker around them. They also develop like a culture of like acceptance of certain
*  aspects of life that come with the injuries and pain and suffering and you know like wrestlers
*  they like brag on suffering the most. They want to suffer more than anybody. They're like that's
*  the badge of honor is what time do you get up 430. I was on my 14th mile at 430. You know like yeah
*  this drag you into deep water. Let's make it worse. That's the part of the culture of wrestling is
*  embracing the grind. That's the whole thing. It's like being the guy who can push being that cam
*  Haynes motherfucker that does those 340 mile runs is because I think I've read before is this
*  accurate that the highest winning percentage in the UFC were all from the wrestling background.
*  Is that accurate. I'd probably say that's probably accurate. I think if you had a see if you had to
*  say like what's the back. I've always said that's the foundation of martial arts because the
*  wrestler can decide where the fight takes place. A wrestler generally mentally they're going to be
*  tougher because they went through the hardest thing when they were a child. The hardest thing
*  as a child is wrestling. You're starving yourself when you're growing. You know you're dehydrating
*  yourself before matches. You're training and competing dehydrated. You're in a fucking hot room
*  clashing with other alpha males and you're throwing each other around. It's the hardest thing.
*  And stuff infections every once in a while. But that skill is so important. The skill to be able
*  to manipulate bodies and take them down and if you could teach a wrestler jiu-jitsu. Oh my god
*  they're so much better at it because they're just so accustomed. It's just they just have to
*  learn a new series of movements to go with this skill set. They already they're great at controlling
*  bodies. Yeah and just the proximity. Like people aren't good with being all up in people and they're
*  like I live here. They live there. And then the other thing is if you could teach a wrestler how
*  to strike they have such an advantage because you can't take them down and you're worried about them
*  taking you down so that opens you up to certain shots. It happens all the time where guys are
*  worried about a takedown and they get blasted because they're thinking this guy could take me
*  down at any moment and then you get hit. It happens all it's like another element that they put in that
*  you have to you have to deal with that they don't have to deal with. They're not worried about you
*  taking them down. You're not even going to try. So they don't they can be completely relaxed with
*  their takedown defense. Terrifying. Yes horrible. Being here with an elite wrestler is fucking horrible.
*  I've even seen like elite wrestlers even in business and stuff like that. You get always
*  feels like they're trying to shoot in on you. Right. They're looking for the weakness trying
*  to shoot. You're like this is just kind of in you. Well they also know that they can. You know
*  you're walking around knowing you can pick up any guy you want dump him on his head. Yeah. And most
*  likely they'd have no say in it. Like there's nothing they can do. You don't get a vote. Yeah
*  man if you're like if if you're around a judo black belt and you're wearing a winter coat
*  you might as well have a hammer like right above your head because that guy's just going to use
*  that coat and slam you into the concrete. You're basically helpless. Yeah. If you don't know judo
*  and you tangle up with like a real judo black belt you're going to fly through the air and you're
*  going to land on the ground with all of his weight and your weight on top of you. And even if you
*  don't bang your head your whole body is going to be out of air. You're not going to you don't know
*  how to land. No. You're going to land. Especially when a guy's controlling. Oh and he's going to
*  shoulder right into you as he lands. You're fucked. Yeah. So that guy's going to look at
*  every person like meat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I never realized how effective a geechoke was until
*  hoist geechoke to me. It was my first ever. I was like yeah I'll try a jujitsu. He did like a clinic.
*  He's like come on up for this thing. And my buddy is on me trying to do the thing. And then I thought
*  hoist put me in like the member the old thing like the paper cutters. Oh yeah. Pretty sure that was
*  what he has for a forearm. Way different. Yeah. My big buddy that's my size. Hoist is way different
*  than that. It's leverage. Holy cow. It's tying that shoe. It was like his armor made with scissors.
*  It was just like this is amazing. Like it's so cool to see perfection right. Yeah. Well that's
*  the other thing about coats and jackets or even a hoodie. You could choke someone so easy with a hoodie.
*  Really? Just get your thumbs in deep and squeeze it. Yeah you could choke the shit out of someone
*  if you grab somebody with a hoodie and just drew them in especially like like I said a leather coat
*  like a leather coat or a winter coat. Yeah. You got good grip. So what do you gotta wear? A jean jacket.
*  Oh yeah. Oh I choked the fuck out of somebody with a jean jacket. You know you got top and bottom denim.
*  Jay Leno you're in trouble with that jean shirt. That thing's durable. You know what I think durable around your neck.
*  You want some shit that tears easy. Like you want a shirt that already has cuts in it.
*  You're pre-loaded. You should like pre-load the back of your shirt. Make some cuts in it just in case someone grabs you.
*  Because someone can just grab your t-shirt. There's actually a Gracie self-defense thing
*  that was on that I was looking at the other day. It was a really smart move where this woman was
*  showing that you can grab a hold of someone's t-shirt if you're a woman and you're getting
*  attacked by a man. Just grabbing a hold of their t-shirt and then getting your legs around their neck.
*  You're jamming your carotid artery. Their carotid arteries through your thumb while you're holding
*  the t-shirt and squeeze with your legs. He could put a guy out. Especially a guy that doesn't know
*  what's happening and doesn't know how to protect himself. I don't know how to do that. That's not it.
*  But it was she was on her back. It was on YouTube. I tried that one time. I was goofing around with
*  my buddy. We call him the cyborg. He's an absolute just monster of a human. And he and I were goofing
*  around and I was on my back. I got him the little leg scissors on his head and I grabbed his arm
*  and I'm like, I'm going to pull his arm off. I'm a big strong deadlifter. I got him. I finally got him.
*  He was 6'2", 2'90", all out. He looked like Gordon but bigger and stronger.
*  I thought he was going out and he woke up and he picked me up while I was hanging out and then just
*  slammed me down on the ground like, man, screw this. People could do that to people. No,
*  no one could stand up with a person hanging off them and slam them back. You got to hurt his leg.
*  I didn't know that. Yeah, that's got clobbered. You want to see the worst version of that ever?
*  Rampage Jackson versus Ricardo Arona. Did you ever see that in Pride? It's the worst case scenario
*  of holding on to like a triangle while a guy picks you up. And Rampage in his prime was a
*  fucking machine. He was so powerful. So he takes this dude who's 200 plus pounds, hoists him over
*  his head and slams him down like a pill. So look at this. So he's caught in the triangle. Watch how
*  Rampage does this. Yeah. Bro, that was one of the worst KOs in the history of the sport.
*  I mean, that dude could have definitely could have died. He probably got the worst trauma.
*  Yeah. The worst brain trauma. Did he knee himself in the face too?
*  I think Rampage collided heads with them as well. So it's probably a bunch of shit. Yeah,
*  like all kinds. I think right there is squashed his guts. Yeah, his shoulder. Rampage's head
*  went into his. This is a crazy slam, man. Look at that. Mine was not nearly as devastating,
*  but it was enough to maybe not want to do that again. That was the worst. And this guy was
*  never the same again. Ricardo Arona was never the same again. That is such a crazy. So that all
*  could have been avoided. Like that's not what you do when you have a triangle. If you see a guy
*  posturing up, you immediately go under. Oh, come walks. If he's got you in the air, you let go of
*  the fucking triangle. The thing that's holding him in there was him. He's holding himself in there.
*  Yes. He was the pit. He wanted all because sometimes you can keep it right. Sometimes you
*  can keep a triangle and you get slammed and it just makes the triangle tighter. But you gotta know
*  when you're way up in the air, you gotta let go. You gotta fully let go and then try to sprawl.
*  Something has to happen. You have to disrupt this motion. This thing that's happening and the best
*  way is an underhook. Like as soon as you feel like he starts to stand up, you hook the leg
*  and worst case scenario, you transition to a leg bar. You let go of the triangle. You get control
*  that leg and use that leg either to try to submit him or sweep him. But you can never hold onto a
*  triangle if the guy's standing up. It's just fucking concrete. You're done. You're dead.
*  You're done. Your head is pulverized. Yeah, it was bad enough on turf, but I won't do that again.
*  That was like, you know, there's a little bit of springiness to the ground because it's in a ring
*  still. And there's probably a certain amount of padding on the surface. How hard are those rings?
*  And I've walked around in them. There's a little bit like the UFC has a small amount of foam,
*  like a padding. And it's very important really because, you know, guys' heads bounce off and
*  they get head kicked. They fall down. Their heads bounce up. They get hit with a big right hand or
*  something. You bounce your head. So you can't have a real hard floor. But it's not soft enough where
*  you want, you know, John Jones power slamming you. No, not really any day. No days actually.
*  That's crazy. Yeah, it's, I mean, to be one of those people that make a living doing that,
*  that is a wild way to go. Yeah. What happened where that decided like that was the direction
*  they were going to go? You're like, you know what? I'm going to get the crap beat out of me and
*  dole out a lot of pain and see how this shakes out. Or do you just kind of like wake up one day and
*  you're in that world? You're like, I'm pretty good. Well, you're probably a wild person to begin with
*  and you're probably excited by dangerous, scary things. And you're probably pretty good at it,
*  which is why you're fighting professionally. Yeah. You know, so you're probably trained in the gym
*  and you realize you're better than most people. Maybe a few amateur fights and fuck a few people
*  up and go, you know, I think I'm the fucking man. You start believing in. Yeah. And some of them
*  are right. Yeah. John Jones. Every now and then a guy is correct. Like that's the way you should
*  have went. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Fucking everybody up. Yeah. Everybody badly. It's okay.
*  You were talking about first. So Tyson on your, that's, that's my heavyweight. That's my heavy
*  all-timer. John Jones for us. He's the guy that's like, I feel like Tyson in his prime. You have to
*  have him on the Mount Rushmore. You want to have Jack Dempsey, you want to have Joe Frazier. You
*  want to, I mean, it's like a lot of guys who are really good. It's hard to say like Muhammad Ali,
*  Joe Lewis, Rocky Marciano. There's a lot of like, for me, the one that you can't remove is Tyson.
*  Right. So there's a bunch of other ones. Lenick Lewis in his prime was fucking amazing. Larry
*  Holmes doesn't get the credit he deserves in his prime. There's a lot of guys who are really good
*  heavyweight champions, but you have to have Tyson. Everything else is negotiable. Tyson has to be
*  there in my, in my mind. Yeah. You know, different people disagree. Do you watch other sports besides
*  fighting sports or combat sports? I watch a little football. Yeah. I've been watching football lately.
*  I enjoy it. It's fun. Pro or college. I've watched high school. Yeah. Right. I watch college and I
*  watch pro. I went to an NFL game first time this year. Kind of cool. It was fun. Yeah. So the Jets
*  played the Cowboys down in Dallas. That was wild. It's wild when you see the scale of it, you know,
*  the scale of it, the size. Have you been in many college games before? A few, a few UT games. Oh,
*  you were at UT, right? Yeah. That was fun. I got to shoot the cannon at UT. Oh, nice. That was fun.
*  Isn't it crazy? Like, have you been keeping up with like the NIL and all the, the transfer portals
*  and how that's changed the landscape? I have not. What is that? What is it? NIL is it name, image,
*  and likeness. Oh, that right. The money thing. Yeah. The money thing is crazy. Well, they should
*  have been paying those fucking kids a long ass time ago. They should retroactively pay all those
*  kids. That'll be interesting. They should. They should. They were making money off of them. It's
*  crazy how much money they make. The amount of money that's happening now. It's interesting
*  because like it actually, from a couple of my friends that are in that world, it creates a
*  different conversation with the new kids. Cause let's say in high school, they're, you know,
*  they're bringing in these recruits and everything like that. And everyone is kissing their butt.
*  Hey man, they're like, Hey, we really want you to be here. We want you to be a whatever. Pay me,
*  bitch. And now it's turning into pay me. Right. And, but then the other side of the, I want a
*  Corvette. Oh, that's dude. I have friends that tell me that they're, they're athletes who, when they're
*  coming to a recruiting trip, say if there's not a quarter million dollar signing bonus as just a part
*  of the deal, I'm not getting on the plane for the recruiting trip. An 18 or 17 year old kid saying
*  that that's balls. But meanwhile, they're right. You know who else should be doing that? The fucking
*  Olympics. Yeah. Fucking Olympics. They should all say, fuck you pay me. They really should.
*  That's the greatest scam in all of competitive sports. Well, now they can now. I mean, the
*  Olympic committee, but originally it was amateur, which was sucked. Meanwhile, like what you mean
*  is like the NBA players can represent the United States and play in the Olympics. That's, that's
*  cute. But what about the swimmers? What about the people? What about the gymnasts? What about the
*  boxers? Those fucking, all those people should get paid. Yeah. Every single one of them. And only,
*  and no one really cares about Olympic athletes, but every four years, like a buddy of mine won
*  the shoot the 2004 shot put Olympics. And he was like, I still have to ask my mom for money.
*  He's like, because no one cares about the Olympics, but every four years.
*  And you're like, you have a degree at Dartmouth, a business degree, and you're the Olympic champion.
*  And, and he was the first athlete to ever eBay himself. So he had a shirt that says this space
*  for rent. And so he would, he like would put himself on the Mars, like kind of like the first
*  10 hours. Like, Hey man, I have to make money throwing the steel ball. And I'm 30 something
*  years old. I'm a world champion and I still have to ask for money every three, every four years,
*  or for three. They used to do that with the UFC used to be able to have sponsors. So yeah,
*  anything you want all like condom depot on your shorts.
*  How about this old days like tank Abbott and all this guy, at least the love watching all that
*  was in college. We were like, get it paid review and like, check it out. Yeah, man. That's the dark
*  days. The early days. No one knew what was going on. No one really knew what was effective. You
*  saw some people were effective one way and you thought that's the way to go. And like, yeah,
*  it was kind of like when you're in high school, when you would go sneak out of the house and
*  go watch faces of death. Oh yeah. And it was like, wow, this is like this cool thing. It's like the
*  UFC. Kids will never understand how difficult it was to see fucked up things. We were young.
*  It was hard, really hard. You had to try hard. You had to like know somebody.
*  You had no older kids. You had to know somebody in the city. Someone, someone's some dark
*  warehouse. I had a copy of some barnyard Betty video. It's always weird. Yeah. No, it's just like,
*  yeah, you rode your bike all around and you like find some weird wood pile. I remember when we were
*  kids, someone had a video. I think it was like a barnyard Betty type video. Like when them ladies
*  have sex with a bunch of animals and one of us had to watch the door. So if we, if we had a video
*  like that, we're playing the basement. One of us had to go up to the top of the staircase and wait
*  by the door so that no one could just open the door. And then they open the door. You would pretend
*  like, oh, I was just coming through the door, you know, so like you hold it out of the door so they
*  can't get in like, oh, sorry. And then the kids downstairs would hear that and it'd pop the tape
*  out and pretend they were, you know, playing Atari or Atari, but you had to pop that fucking tape out
*  quick because if mom caught you down there watching a chick blow a German shepherd. Yeah, that didn't
*  pan out. And they were like real grainy, like copies of copies, you know, like two guys get together
*  with two VCRs and they record. Oh yeah. Well, all the weird you have to get the cables in the back.
*  So is that, was that you live in the city grown up or I lived in the suburbs. I lived in Newton,
*  Newton, uh, suburb of Massachusetts. Okay. Boston. Yeah. Yeah. Did you live in New Jersey at one
*  point? Yeah. That's where I was born. Yeah. Yeah. So is my dad. What part? Uh, hillside. Have you seen
*  all these UFOs in New Jersey lately? No. Yeah. Like over the last few days, there's been this
*  steady stream. They're not UFOs. They're drones. Oh, I did see something. I think you posted
*  something about the drones or something, right? I don't think I did somebody. Um, but a lot of
*  people have been, but they're not moving in any extraordinary way. They look like drones.
*  They do. It just looks like a bunch of assholes thinks it's fun. Right. Put drones up everywhere.
*  But now there's all this like weird mythology attached to it where like the governor was saying
*  sometimes as soon as we put eyes on them, they take off and, but if I was a UFO though, like
*  if I was an alien and I knew that a bunch of people are trying to be smart asses and they're
*  putting these drones in the sky, I'd be like perfect time to visit. Oh yeah. These dipshits
*  won't know the difference. Yeah. I have to use my cloaking technology. I could just fly over their
*  head and they're going to assume this is more nonsense. Dude, my, uh, one of my buddies, he,
*  uh, probably weird even say like he had a friend that sent him a video of some weird stuff going
*  on in the desert, whatever. And it went through and then he showed it to me and then it just
*  disappeared. And he was like the dude he was talking to said it disappeared. But then like,
*  can you have a file that kind of self destructs? Cause it disappeared on his phone too. He's like,
*  uh, how do they take this off? They take this off of my phone.
*  I don't know. I mean, I've never heard of a file. Jamie, have you ever heard of a video
*  file that self destructs or that someone's like some, uh, mission impossible. Yeah. So
*  one could chirp into it and like, it was wild. Like he was like, I mean that like this recording
*  were destroyed. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And 30 seconds. Yeah. That was wild. I mean, I've
*  wondered though, like, could they somehow backtrack it where it had been shared? Well,
*  that would be problematic. Cause then they would have access to things on your phone. I think,
*  I doubt that's ever a case. More likely would be they put like a time that someone could watch
*  the video into the video where it's valid. It's probably still fixable. If someone still has it.
*  Well, this dude took the video and then did it on his phone and did it on his phone and shared it.
*  And then he said one day he just looked into it and looked in his phone. It was gone.
*  He might be retarded. Well, that could be the case, but my buddy's like yourself, my phone too.
*  So yeah, I don't know, man. He retarded too. It's hard to say. It might be real though. I've never
*  heard of that happening though, which I would assume that I would have heard of something like
*  that. Especially the amount of people that I talked to that are in the world. I figured.
*  Excuse me. A thread on Reddit about a glitch in iOS 17 that might have made some people's videos
*  randomly disappear. Important ones that they wanted. Right. And then they think it's the UFOs.
*  Oh yeah. This doesn't say anything about that. This is just like, why is this happening?
*  It's happening to anybody else. Okay. Google this. Is it possible to make a self-destructing video
*  that only has a certain amount of plays in it? Well, that'd be cool. Right. Like maybe you could
*  code it into the video that once this video plays for whatever, 14 minutes, 14 minutes of play,
*  it automatically 17 decodes itself, you know, or randomizes it's it's packed because it's basically
*  just information, right? Right. Information viewed through a Kodak does have like a site,
*  like a cyclical rate, like this many times that like, because I know there's certain things like
*  someone will send you something on Instagram and you can watch the video, but then you can't go
*  back and watch it again. Right. Yeah. Or they send you a voice message and then it goes away. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's how Alex Jones likes to roll. He sends you voice messages and they go away.
*  That's probably a really good idea for him. Yeah. Smart move. Best not to have a paper trail.
*  I don't even know like how much of that encrypted messaging stuff works. You know,
*  I know when Tucker was saying that he was organizing that meeting with Putin in Russia
*  and that the government called him up because they knew that he was meeting Putin,
*  because they had access to his signal. And he was like, what you have access to? I didn't know
*  even know someone could get into my signal. I thought that was encrypted. Nope. Nope. They
*  can get in there. So it's like how much of this stuff is really how much of it is really encrypted
*  and protected and how much would they even let you know if they can break it? Why would they even
*  tell you? Well, that's the whole point. It's like, it's exactly what you would say that you couldn't
*  do it. Exactly. Yeah, that's but that was they they fucking spilled the beans. Right. So once they
*  spilled the beans, like I know a lot of people, including Elon Musk, started questioning signal.
*  Sure. So I talked to someone in the government and I said, what can you handle signal? Like how
*  does someone is it as long as the state actor knows the phone number was the answer. So all
*  they have to do is know your phone number. So if they know your phone number and you have signal,
*  game over boys. If you're, you know, I mean, I'm sure it's probably they probably need to ask
*  somebody if they can do it. It's probably not something you just know. But if an agent is like
*  Bert Soren's acting a little fucking fishy, let's see what he's signaling to his friends.
*  Yeah. And the opportunity to just decide subjectively if that's the thing is. And
*  then whatever you carry in your notes and whatever is in your folders or your photos.
*  They're going to all kinds of ballistics. For sure. They've got all the weird crap.
*  They're going to know where my deer stands are and everything. You got dick pics. They got all of it.
*  They have your dick pics. It's like there's no way around that anymore. I think that's that's a myth.
*  The idea that somehow or another you could have some sort of a protection from that happening
*  today. Yeah. Are you making phone calls? You are. Okay. Are you on a network? Are you on wi fi? Are
*  you like, I think you're fucked. Yeah, you would have to think so. Yeah. I mean, you have to think
*  there's enough backdoors and alleged probable causes or however someone wants to spin it.
*  Well, that's also how they got Huawei banned from the United States. Because I remember, you know,
*  I'm a bit of a phone nerd. And back in the day, Huawei had the best phones. Their phones were
*  like way more advanced than some of the American phones that were coming out. Yeah, man, they had
*  incredible cameras and like big battery life and like crazy zoom possibilities. And I was looking
*  to get this new Huawei phone. Sure. And then Huawei got banned from the United States. And I was
*  like, what goes back to anything that's banned man makes you really start questioning. It does.
*  But when they kind of all agree, there was very little pushback that there was real security
*  problems with these phones and not just phones, but network devices, routers, different,
*  different components that had third party entrance. So it was they had the capability
*  of accessing information that's being transferred back and forth on a network
*  through these routers. And then I think people are like, Hey, why is that in there? Yeah. And then
*  they realize, oh, the Chinese government is in complete cahoots with Huawei. Like if you own a
*  company like Huawei, you're down with the government. You have to be. That's how you stay in business.
*  Right. You can't be some rebel out there operating on your own, making billions of dollars creating,
*  you know. Yeah. Well, you had Mike Ben was a Ben's on. That was a wonderful podcast.
*  Crazy crap. Yeah. It's eye opening. Yeah. Spun that past a couple of my buddies. I actually,
*  it was the same buddy that gave me the Yuri Besomov video that I gave you. Oh,
*  that fucking videos changed my mind. Right. Yeah. When you first sent me that you're the first guy,
*  by the way, ladies and gentlemen, because we played that on this podcast, like all the time.
*  Yeah, we were at your house. Yeah. When you played me that I was like, Holy shit. This is exactly
*  what happened. Yeah. I gave it to Jack Carr and Evan Hafer, too. There's no way that was a like,
*  he just guessed it. Right. Yeah. Right. You're like, I'm going to put this next baseball into
*  the, you know, the third aisle up the thing and crack. Wow. That was cool. Seat from the left.
*  You're like, go back and look. So buddy mine that's in that world, he gave that to me four or five
*  years. He told me he's like, this keeps getting deleted. And he kind of gives me the whole
*  briefing on a lot of stuff. It kept getting deleted. Yeah. On YouTube. He's like, they keep
*  taking it down. No, I think honestly, prior to you and Evan and Jack and guys like that,
*  it was not easy to find. I think you guys just changed the algorithm on it enough. Wow. Which
*  is pretty neat. But that doesn't make any sense because I'm pretty sure we just found it online.
*  He, he told me a multiple, multiple times. He's like, they've taken this down often. Why would
*  someone take it down? I'm not sure. But I know some of my buddies that were in the teams and
*  stuff like that, they were like, oh, I remember seeing this back in 95 when I went through buds
*  or when I got out, maybe it was green team, but they were in that early, early days and go,
*  I hadn't seen this video in forever. And then they kind of watched it. They're like, oh my gosh,
*  like you're kind of getting all the background of that. But he was giving me, I can't remember
*  where I was going with this, but he was giving me some insight about the bends. And it was
*  interesting. And I said, I was like, Hey, did you check this out? And he's like, yeah. He's like,
*  sounds like he's read a couple of my briefings. I was like, interesting. Like Mike Benz, some weird
*  stuff got crazy recall too. Oh my gosh. Yeah. He just, no notes, just spitting out all that
*  information right off the top of his head. That's you've had some amazingly impactful guests on here.
*  Like I, I, I'm not trying to blow you up, but like, I'm sure you know, the impact that you've had on
*  the world, which is probably really wild. It's pretty weird. Pretty weird, right? Pretty weird
*  that I didn't even try. That's the best part about it, right? That's the weirdest part.
*  It was all an accident. It's like a hundred percent. Like I just felt like this is what I
*  should do. I should start a podcast and then I should keep doing it. Even when it was totally
*  non-profitable for like five years, I was like, I like doing it. Let's just keep doing it. That's
*  how all the good stuff works. It's like you're passionate about it. I want to go do this thing.
*  Evan and I've talked, he's like, Hey, I make brown, I make brown water. And I'm like,
*  I make steel rectangles. It's weird. I don't know why we decided to do it.
*  But once you figure out a thing that you're really passionate about, then you'll become
*  successful if you just keep following it. But the thing about the podcast thing was I managed to
*  keep the same spirit of just doing what I enjoy doing. Like if I could just have conversations
*  with people with no phones and sit and especially if I could get a scientist to sit near and explain
*  things to me for three hours, I would have always been interested in doing that. But I just,
*  it's you can't do that. They won't do it. You have to become friends with them. And you can only be
*  friends with so many of them, you know, and then you have to fly to them and sit down with them.
*  Time. And you're like, you created a honey trap here. Then you're like, Hey, I'll bring everyone
*  here and talk to as long as you can guarantee other people are going to listen. People want to
*  talk about anything, which is really weird. It's wild. Like that's the way you can guarantee that
*  you can get them to come as long as they're going to other people going to hear it. Right. They get
*  sell books and yeah, the whole deal. Yeah. And that's great. But it's, it's just genius that
*  I just appreciate the illumination on very, uh, ideas. Like I love that there's people on the
*  right, the people from left people that like this, hate this. Like that is so refreshing.
*  It's good for all of us. It is. It's good to hear people even that you don't agree with
*  course as long as they're nice. As long as that's my course. I don't want to argue with anybody and
*  getting fucking screaming matches. There's some people that are there like we were talking about
*  earlier that they, that's how they get engagement by constantly getting in these students. That's
*  why they have those shows like Pierce Morgan likes to do that. Whereas like four people on the show,
*  they all yell over each other and they're all remote. So no one's there. It's like,
*  that sounds horrible. It's horrible. I don't, I don't find out nothing. If you could sit down
*  with someone, even if you disagree with them and just let them talk, you could have a conversation,
*  you know, find out why they think the way they do. You don't have to fight them on it. Just like
*  ask them, what is it about this thing? Yeah. Candid and curious, right? Candid as in I'll
*  actually tell you what I think and curious. I'll actually care what you think. Yeah. And I always
*  try to think the way they think. If someone's talking to me about a certain thing, like I will,
*  you know, people are, Oh, you'll agree with anybody. I'm like, I kind of will. If I can try to see
*  things through your head and I'll try to steelman it for you. Like if someone is saying something
*  and I go, okay, so you're saying that, but if it's preposterous, I'll stop it. I'll stop it and go,
*  that doesn't make any sense because of this. Like I can see that you haven't thought this through
*  because, or you didn't know about that or, you know, how could you say this when this is possible?
*  Like how do you, how do you manage those two things? So three people will push back with
*  kind of love, right? Because the disagreement doesn't have to mean dismissal. No. And when it
*  does, that's the opposite of love and respect. It's like, no, I don't like you. Well, that's
*  canceling. Well, especially if people get shouty and arguey, you know, it's like, there's a way to
*  do it where you can just talk about stuff and not be dismissive of someone. I mean, I see so many
*  people do it where they, they have their opinion, like Bill Marlicks do that, like dismiss something,
*  someone saying like instantaneously as they're in the middle of explaining it. It's like,
*  it's kind of a sparring thing. You know, you're, you're trying to win rather than trying to just
*  have a conversation. Try to see if the other guy flinches. Yeah. You're shutting them down.
*  You're shutting down things that you think are, you're calling bullshit. It's also a lack of
*  patience, right? Because sometimes you have, you have to have patience to let someone express
*  themselves fully before you disagree, which is really important because sometimes someone will
*  begin to express themselves and I disagree, but then they'll take it around and give me some
*  nuance and some understanding of how they came to their, their opinion. Then I'll go, okay.
*  Okay. So I see, I see how you, at least I see the track. Yeah. And so it's more important for you
*  for this than it is to acknowledge that. And they're like, yes. I'm like, okay, I understand.
*  So when did you decide that that was, and then, and then I want to go like, I want to know, are you
*  a real thinker or are you a person who has adopted a conglomeration of ideas that comes along with an
*  ideology? So there's, there's really smart people that have done that and they might not even know
*  they've done that until you corner them. And then you find like, where did it come? Where's the
*  trans kids? There's like occasionally, you know, there's a subject like make sense of this. You
*  make sense of this. Yeah. Follow it upstream to the source and make sense of this. And let's
*  acknowledge what a kid is. You, I want, I want to know how vulnerable you think children are. First
*  of all, I want to know, do you have any? Second of all, I want to know how malleable and suggestible,
*  like how open to suggestion are children in your eyes? I want to know how, do you think kids should
*  be able to get tattoos? Do you think kids should be able to get married at five? Do you think kids,
*  you know what I'm saying? Do you think they should be, what do you think that they can control and
*  not control? Do you even understand children or are you sacrificing them and their future,
*  these kids that you don't even know for your ideology, for your ideological position? That's
*  like cult-like. And then you find that out about people that think they're intelligent until they're
*  confronted with these like insurmountable ethical dilemmas. Right. A similar one to, let's say,
*  someone who eats meat, but hates hunting. Yeah. You're like, you could hate, you can not want to do it.
*  Yes. But there's still a killing and a murder at some point and you could either be a part of that
*  or just outsource it and be okay with it. Well, it's also, that's a cultural thing too, right?
*  Like there's a lot of people in the UK that don't like hunting. Yeah. And they eat meat and, you know,
*  they'll tell you, like my wife was having a conversation, she was at a dinner with a bunch
*  of people and I was out hunting and this guy was eating a steak. He's like, that's deplorable.
*  She's like, where do you think that came from? This is so stupid. Like you're literally carving
*  a steak while you're saying it's deplorable that someone's out hunting. Like we eat those animals.
*  What is generally, and I've had this conversation a number of times as well,
*  and generally with folks who are candid, curious and respectful, you could kind of
*  kind of bring them around, right? Yes. Have you had someone that really just dug their heels in or like?
*  No. No, never really in person. Right. Online they'll dig their heels into the cow scum hole,
*  but I feel like most people, this is why talking online sucks. Yep. Most people are good people.
*  I really believe that. Even if they're like trapped in their bullshit and wrapped up in their own
*  head and most people want to be. It's given the chance to be good people. Yeah, and you can kind
*  of help them along to be a good person. You can kind of help them along. We help each other along.
*  Like part of an argument is you. Sure. I know that there's arguments that I've been in in my life
*  that I could have avoided if I was more skillful with conversation and I know that I have avoided
*  a lot of arguments, especially now as a smarter person than I was when I was younger. I'm better
*  at it. I'm better at just like not biting on some bullshit, passive aggressive stupid thing
*  that some guy says. When I was young, if someone got passive aggressive with me, I was like, hey,
*  fuck you. Like, like, let's just go to 10. Where's that going? Let's just go to 10. Yeah. I don't
*  like how you're talking. Like I'm not going to sit here at this stupid party and pretend you're not
*  a cunt. And you know, this has been many times, you know, I got dragged out of a situation before.
*  Yeah. Because I'm like, let's just go to 10. You're a piece of shit. Like I know what you are.
*  Yeah. You're just a shitty person. Likes to throw jabs at people when I'm just trying to be nice.
*  Yeah. And you also know in your pocket, you know, a lot of physical things that could be.
*  But it also, it helps that I know that I'm being nice. So if I'm nice to you and you're being a
*  cunt to me and I'm trying to be nice to you again, you're just thinking that you can just get away
*  with this. And that's when I like to go, Hey, fuck you. And you see that look in their face,
*  like, Oh no. Yeah. Oh no. You've gone into fuck you land. Yeah. Now we're here. Yeah. And by the way,
*  emotional pain is something that people think they can get a free slap. They think they could
*  just get off on you and hit you with emotional pain. Like if we're playing this, let's hurt each
*  other game. How about I just fuck you up? Yeah. Like how about that? How about I just decide,
*  I'll spend the night in jail. How about that? How about fuck you? You know, because like that's what
*  you're doing emotionally. You're trying to create the abuse pain. You're, you're absolutely
*  being abusive. Yes. And some people have make a habit out of like demeaning people to their face
*  and they think they can get away with it. And it's a really shitty practice. I do appreciate
*  the people who physically put it into that. Like I've never, I've never really been like, yeah,
*  you know, I'll, I'll do what I need to do. Right. But I've never been like, I don't know. Like,
*  like Pat, a couple of days I'm not proud of cause I kind of went ahead and hit that throttle.
*  Yeah. But most of the time it's avoidable. Yeah. But in some days, unfortunately you're
*  not in the emotional state and sometimes it is avoidable and you don't avoid. Yeah. That's the
*  thing. Like sometimes it is avoidable. I'm so much better at that. Yeah. I've expressed my 25. I had
*  no, I didn't understand that you don't have to do this. Yeah. I've, I've expressed my emotional
*  immaturity at times. I'm like, yeah, I could really take in that one a different way. And you're
*  thankful. You're like, man, I'm glad that one really didn't go sideways. Cause that's also like,
*  it could go terrible and someone get murdered. I mean, things happen and zero question can't
*  believe what they did. And then all of a sudden someone's dead. That happens every day in America.
*  Oh, I've had a couple close ones that you just kind of, everyone walks away and it's like,
*  cause you get like, it's like, uh, what was that movie? Like, um, Sherlock Holmes. Remember when
*  you can see the situations and he like pauses it and you can see like, and when you like pauses
*  and you're like, this would happen, this would happen, this would happen. And then you're like,
*  oh, there's a dead guy. You're backing up. You're like, glad that didn't happen. Okay, bye. I'm
*  gone. Bye. Just walk away. It's like, you have to learn that. And the problem with young guys is
*  first of all, their brain's not fully formed. They're impulsive. They do wild things.
*  And then if they feel like they're being slighted, they feel like to be a man, cause they want to be
*  a man, you have to do something about it. Well, it's the number one question every man has.
*  Every man has the same question. Am I, am I good enough? Right. That's the wounding, right? Right.
*  And every woman goes, her question is, do you, do you see me? It's exactly it. Do you see me? And
*  a man says, am I good enough? That's why there's sport. That's why there's fighting. That's why
*  people try to make money. That's why they try to flex on each other. It's the little boy inside all
*  of us going, am I good enough? Yeah. And then there's the people that get past that. And then
*  it becomes this ultimate challenge. Like the ultimate challenge of life is the most difficult
*  puzzle to solve. Yes. And you can solve it above and beyond all these other psychopaths. So you're
*  competing with all these other people that are very much like you, but what separates you from them
*  is the work that you put in. Yeah. Discipline, drive, mindset, whatever, whatever it is that
*  you can find that gives you that edge to pull ahead with all the, from all these other people
*  that are very, very competitive as well, doing the same thing. Right. And then with men, they
*  feed off each other in those environments. They feed off. Like a West Side Barbell. Yeah. Like
*  Kronk Gym. Yeah. And then when you're, you're wondering that, and then when someone questions
*  it and publicly questions it in front of your boys or front of whatever, it's like, no, I'll show you
*  I'm good enough. I'll do something stupid right now and end up in jail. Especially someone who's
*  just a walking dead man with a mouth. Right. Like someone who knows they can't defend themselves.
*  And so they just feel comfortable doing that publicly because they think they're being
*  protected by society. Like that's the worst. Yeah. Yeah. This, this actual false state of security.
*  Like, man, if we're in the jungle right now, you wouldn't be doing that. Or when women think they
*  can do it. When women get mouthy with men, like don't do. Why? When I was, I think I was 16 or
*  17 years old, I was in high school and there was this kid that moved into the neighborhood. He came
*  from Iran and his family had a lot of money. And so they had this, I think it was in Beacon Hill.
*  I forget where it was, but it was a really nice neighborhood. Yeah. And this kid had this giant
*  fucking house on this huge lawn. So he decided to have a party. Of course. So this is how he's going
*  to make friends. He just moved here from another country. Right. Right. So he has a party and kids
*  from every fucking high school came to this party. And I was at the party with a bunch of my friends
*  and I was walking up the staircase. I'll never forget this. So I'm walking up the staircase and
*  then, you know, so it's like right here in front of me while this is going down. I can't remember
*  what the girl did. She either slapped this guy or she threw a drink in his face. I can't remember
*  which one it was. Some offense. But I remember he uncorked a right hand like Roberto Duran. This dude
*  threw a right hand like he knew how to punch. Cause I knew how to punch. So I watched him like,
*  oh, good mechanics. Yeah. Right. Right. Really. This just, just hit her on the chin.
*  Her head snaps back. A guy catches her. She goes out and then it's bedlam. It's bedlam. I mean,
*  people are fighting left and right. There's people fighting in the stairwell. I had to run out to,
*  there's piles of guys out on the lawn. It's spread like a disease. It was like, how did you decide
*  to hit this guy because of that? It was screaming and then screaming started people screaming at
*  the people screaming, which people were fighting the people that were screaming. It was the wildest
*  thing. It was like a disease ran through the house like that, like world war Z where everybody's like,
*  and I managed to not have any fights. A couple of my friends got in fights. Like one of the better
*  fighters. I was never interested in street fighting. I'm like, let me get out of here.
*  I know what this is. This is sure. I understand danger. So I got out there and, but I'll never
*  forget that that girl thought she could hit that guy or do whatever she did. I forget what she
*  thought. I wish I could remember quality. Kind of all I remember is because it's like 30, how many
*  years ago was that 40 years ago? That's a while ago. Oh my God. It's 40 years ago. Yeah. So it
*  was like this, I mean, just fucking, I'll never forget that man. Horrible to laugh at it because
*  she forgot a lot of things that night. She definitely listened to the podcast grade.
*  Yeah. She was probably like, that's me. My wife, I still can't talk. Like she, for sure. Got a
*  broken face. I mean, he hit her so hard and her head snapped back, just snapped. Like she had no
*  idea she was going to get punched by a big guy who knew how to punch. But he was like, Hey, fuck you.
*  Like you just got the wrong guy with like three Millers in them. And he just, probably the first
*  time that guy, probably not the first guy he hit a check. Yeah. Cause the way he did it was like,
*  he didn't slap her. You know, he didn't slap her. That's a scary one. He could have just slapped her
*  or pushed her or something. You didn't have to KO her, but, but there's women that think that they
*  can just go up to a guy and yell because they're protected by society. There's fucking psychos out
*  there. It just goes back to be nice. Yes. Be nice, be nice, but there's like you motherfucker,
*  I'll fucking kick, I'll fucking kill you. Like, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey. I've been backed up a couple
*  of times with that, that bumps on the chest and it's like, all right, all right, all right. Then
*  you're like backed against a car, like at a tailgate or something. You're like, yeah. And when you say,
*  don't touch me, it gets, it gets hot. And then it's like, they might just touch you. Cause you said,
*  don't touch me. And like, I'm telling you, don't touch me. And then you have to touch them and then,
*  oh, you're assaulting me. Like, no, no, no, you're still talking. So I haven't assaulted you.
*  If I assaulted you, this would be over super quick. So let's not do that. Yep. That happened to me in
*  DC. I was walking with my wife and it's during when everything was popping off. Oh, big, big time.
*  Big, big time things. People got real mouthy, real, real. And we're walking through it. And of course,
*  you know, truth be told, I'm walking through, I'm, my wife looks like a Viking also. And we're
*  walking through DC during the height of everything, height of everything, no mask cause I'm outside and
*  I'm a sovereign individual and screw that. And a whole chattering group of a certain population of,
*  you know, well, Santa Fe. And so they're right. And I was like, and I just said, I'm not going to
*  stop walking. Please move out of my way. You know, F you have this, that then you just,
*  Meanwhile, you did nothing. I literally was walking across and they were 40 yards from me and ran
*  across the street to come yell at me. Like a bark. They ever seen like a, like a bear or a wild borg
*  is like bait by dogs. And they're all like, yeah, we're just walking. And it's like, okay, please.
*  And we're trying to get to my hotel and there's a cop cause they boarded everything off. Cause
*  everything was crazy. It was like the four big groups were all doing the deal that weekend.
*  And I was like, my hotel is right there. Sorry. I said, sir, do you think I really want to deal
*  with this? Like, like in there, everyone has their cameras out. Cause they're like big guys
*  going to smoke somebody. Right. And there's a whole deal. And then finally, what actually,
*  one of them was chirping at me and she fell down and tripped over something. And I helped her up
*  because that's what you do. And then get your hands on. It's like, okay, man, can I please get
*  to my, like, this is a thing. So, and then they played music all night till seven in the morning,
*  right outside of our hotel, just to make sure that no one slept. It was a wonderful time.
*  Fun times. It was a great time. Whatever happened to law and order. Why do people think that was a
*  good thing? Why? There were so many goofy motherfuckers that didn't want people mad at them.
*  So they started yelling out, defund the police. They started getting on board with it. Even Kamala
*  Harris posted defund the police. Like, I mean, defund the police on Twitter. Yeah. Like when is
*  this a good idea ever to like kind of cancel any, well, like there's like, like besides like someone
*  that hurts children, like after that kind of do what you want to do. Right. Well, that's not even
*  a canceling thing. That was just people had decided that there was an enemy out there.
*  I say this, that like protests are too much like war. You're on the ground and you're marching
*  around with a bunch of people yelling, you all have a cause and you're all moving as one group.
*  It's too much like war. I think there's some, there's triggers. That's why mob mentality exists,
*  because you got to be able to kill people if some shit's going down, if you're at war.
*  Because what escalates. Right. There's a mode that people snap into. It's called mob mentality. Why
*  does it exist? It exists because at certain points in history, we have gone to war with other groups
*  of people on the, on the ground. And I think that's built into your psyche. Yep. And I think it's just
*  like catching a fish. You know how you catch a fish? Like if no one's ever caught a fish before,
*  you catch it. Oh, you get so excited. I think it's cause your brain is hardwired to know that that
*  fish is going to feed you. Yes. And that's why it's exciting. And you're hardwired to know that if
*  you're yelling and you meet an opposing group, those are the bad people. And you're going looking
*  for people that are opposing groups. Cause you got power. There's a bunch of you. Yeah. You're rolling
*  dee. You're rolling deep and you find that fucking white guy with the beard and you're like, he's the
*  enemy. It was wild. It was wild, but it was like an open door to this psyche that has always existed.
*  That mob mentality has always been a thing. And if you open that door and you allow it to stay open
*  and you don't do something to close it with law and order, you have fucking madness. You have mad.
*  And we had that. We have that on the streets in certain places in this country for months at a time.
*  It was fucking chaotic bonkers. Yeah. It was actually pretty cool in my, and I'm going to say
*  none of that world was cool, but during my, uh, in my town, they, they started burning stuff and
*  everything like that. And my sheriff, he's a, he's a friend of mine. He's like, yeah, we shut that
*  down fast. I was like, what happened? It's like someone threw a brick. I got center mass with a,
*  with a bean bag. Period. First time. And I go, how long did that take us? We haven't had a problem
*  since. Perfect. He's like, you know, that's kind. It's being kind. Exactly. Being back is being kind.
*  Yeah. A severe punishment. Yeah. Really fast. Generally trains people pretty quickly. And then
*  it's like, all right, our town went back to being cool. Everyone was fine. Yeah. There's, there's no
*  reason for it. And it was just the crazy how quickly it all boiled over and the, it was all
*  these events happening together at the same time, right? The COVID, the lockdowns, the anger,
*  everybody got real weird because everyone was just locked in their home for months at a time.
*  And then the George Floyd thing and the public outrage and the people were on the street. And
*  then people were encouraging it and funding it. There was people that were, there were certain
*  groups that were encouraging it, organizing it and funding it. And they got money from people to do
*  it. And they, they had pallets of bricks that were conveniently located on the street. All that stuff's
*  real. Oh yeah. Yeah. No, we, we, we saw it. It was, it was remarkable to see it in real time. That's
*  why it's crazy having a guy like Mike Benz lay out how it all is going down. And you think, oh,
*  it's all organic. People are fed up. Uh-uh. No, no, there's a bunch of people that are profiting
*  off of this. Yes. They want this to take place. They want to be able to push new laws through.
*  They want to be able to grip tighter, tighter control on censorship, tighter. These social media
*  companies have to pay. They're responsible for this. No, no, no, you fucking funded it. You
*  fucking funded it with tax money that was fault filtered through NGOs, you cocksuckers. You guys
*  are a part of this. You want this to happen. Right. That's where everyone's just like, everyone just
*  pause. Just like pump the brakes. If it feels like, uh, uh, what was that song by iron maiden? Uh,
*  I can't remember what it speeds up at the end. That's what it felt like the last four years,
*  especially during 2020. I was like, no, this is the end of like paranoid or whatever it was.
*  And it just sped up and you're like, Oh, is this how the end of the story goes? Like as in humanity?
*  It could be. Yeah. I think we got a taste of what's possible, but I also think,
*  I think it was horrible. Anybody who lost someone, anybody where it all went down. I think it was
*  horrible. Don't get me wrong. But I also think we're lucky. Yes. Because we got to see it.
*  It's horrible if you lost your business. It's horrible if you got forced to get vaccinated.
*  It's horrible. All those things are horrible, but we got to see how many people are fucking cowards.
*  We got to see how many people fold as soon as there are any sort of external pressure
*  from either their surround or how many people got forced into it by their job.
*  We got to see that and we got to see how there are unscrupulous groups in power
*  that will coerce people to do things that are not scientific. They're not ethical. They're not moral
*  if they can profit off of it. And we got to see that that they will use you as a human fucking
*  ATM machine and they will figure out a way to maximize their profits and maximize the control.
*  So now we know. So now we know. So now you can't think that the world is some sort of 1950s movie
*  where the good guys wear the white hats and the bad guys wear the black hats. You got to realize
*  there's a lot of human interest shit going on and humans have a certain interest in getting control
*  over money and over people and they do it whenever they can. And if they can do it through the guise
*  of being progressive and kind or if they can do it through the guise of you know whatever pull
*  yourself up by your bootstraps like whatever it is. They find a way to rationalize these very specific
*  patterns of behavior that the founding fathers of this country fought against when they created the
*  Bill of Rights and they created the Constitution. They did all that knowing that these human nature,
*  these human instincts exist. Yeah it'll keep flowcharting back down to this eventually. It's
*  like hold on people are people and people are going to do people stuff. And every time they pass
*  something like the Patriot Act or the Patriot Act too they just chip away at that. They're chipping
*  away at that and it's their job to do that in their mind. It shouldn't be because there's not
*  enough oversight of them. That's the problem. It's like this is the whole concept of the deep state
*  which was always like such a stupid conspiracy theory for the longest time. People are like oh
*  you worried about the deep state? Until you are. Until you're like oh my god it's real. Oh my god.
*  How did that kid get on that roof? How did he walk around with a fucking range finder like we
*  were talking about before? Range finders? Yeah that's what he had. That's why you use those folks
*  for fucking shooting people. He's not golfing. The whole thing was nuts. The whole thing was nuts and
*  we were all just sitting there going oh the deep state's real. Like oh someone did something here.
*  How did his apartment get professionally scrubbed? Are there a team of people that are actually
*  organizing something like this? Has this happened before? Why won't they release the Kennedy files?
*  He died how many fucking years ago? 1963? Yeah. How? Why? That's 61 years ago. How about you release
*  that? Or how about you guys release that? Yeah or there's maybe a reason? Yeah. Do you think that
*  stuff's gonna I mean do you think 61 years is not a lot of time though? That's a good point.
*  Like maybe we should wait another 60. Makes sense right? People aren't ready yet. They're not ready
*  yet. I've thought about that a lot. I want to know right? I want to see behind all the scenes. I want
*  to see that I want to see the ep scenes, the ditties, the the Ken. Cash Patel says first day
*  day one. Let's go. That's what he says. Let's see if they get him in there. What a stud right? Oh man
*  that's what if you are the deep state you know he said he wanted to do he would close Langley and
*  make it a museum of the deep state. Geez. This is the first thing he said he would do and then just
*  reorganize everything and say now go back to chasing criminals. Yeah. And stop attacking the
*  fucking citizens. Stop spying on people you fucking weirdos. I'm so pumped about him and Tulsi and
*  like there's just such an awesome group of people that are just certainly interesting. I mean it's
*  I'm even excited about the way Trump is doing interviews now. Like he's doing it's like he's
*  become like a wiser person in interviews. Like he does interview with this lady from I think it was
*  NBC. The recent one that he did was over an hour but even the way he was talking to her she was
*  saying things he's like you know you would be so much better if you weren't so biased. So he said
*  to her it was like a kind way of saying it to her. Do you think he always had that and he's just so intelligent he's
*  playing he's playing different cards at different times? I think he's realizing that part of the
*  problem is not just the resistance that he faced but his reaction to the resistance and he still
*  slips sometimes like he tweets out I hate Taylor Swift. Oh my gosh. Which I thought was hilarious.
*  I couldn't stop laughing when I saw that. I just love irrational tweeters. Right I mean at what
*  point does like the incoming president kind of just dunk on somebody? Well he wasn't winning yet. I
*  think he was freaking out you know. I honestly think he was freaking out. You think? Yeah yeah yeah because
*  they they were doing a psyop and they were all of a sudden making it seem like Kamara Harris was
*  the dream that we'd always been looking for and they were tricking people who recognized that she
*  was an unpopular vice president just three weeks ago and everybody was all of a sudden on board.
*  Yeah that one spun around fast. Jesus it was wild to watch but that was another thing like
*  if you can learn from it look we got through it it didn't work but you should learn that the
*  government will organize to do that to protect their position of power because here's what's up
*  the people that are in power and we're not even saying they're evil I'm not saying anything bad
*  about them but the people in the administration that's there currently they're all going to lose
*  their jobs okay or they keep their jobs so if they can keep their jobs what is what's the way
*  we keep our job the way we keep our job is we present her as the best option possible even if
*  they don't think that's true they have a vested interest you're talking about thousands of people
*  that are in control of these very organizations that were going after social media and we're
*  getting them to take down factual information because it was dangerous to their narrative
*  so they have already shown that they don't have ethics they have already shown that they don't
*  give a fuck about freedom of speech and the first amendment what they want is to keep their fucking
*  job and keep power and also not get in trouble for some of the shit they did that was maybe
*  illegal which we wouldn't even known about if Elon didn't buy Twitter. Yeah I mean I agree
*  the Elon buy on Twitter was like that. It's a game changer. The fork in the road for civilization.
*  Yeah it's wild to think isn't it? Mark Andreessen has said there's two forks in the road there's
*  one Elon buys Twitter and two Trump turns his head and doesn't get shot those are the two yeah those
*  if those two things don't happen who fucking knows where we are. I don't disagree and you look at
*  those both scenarios are both like one in a million like how would a the Trump like Trump turns his
*  head like that's wild but then like how would a guy like Elon exist first of all in our lifetime.
*  Right what are the odds? What are the odds right that has the vehicle of Twitter or you know and
*  all the things line up. Not just has the vehicle it has so much fuck you money right he's willing
*  to blow 44 billion dollars on something that's worth 200 billion maybe or rather 20 billion maybe
*  so one of the things that like this is narrative like he's such a bad businessman
*  Twitter is worth 20 billion dollars less than when he purchased it no no no it was never worked that
*  much he overpaid for it right he overpaid for it on purpose yeah knowingly yeah knowingly he just
*  wanted he wanted to take control of this fucking thing that has always been so important to us
*  which is the first amendment yes express here's my favorite people keep saying I keep seeing this
*  where people that go over to blue sky they keep saying what Elon's done is highlight right wing
*  voices and accentuate right and Twitter is overrun by right wing now no no no no this is actually
*  representative of the real country which is 50 50 this is what you never had before because
*  conservative voices were always censored always so now conservative voices and progressive voices
*  coexist and the progressive voices who are the babies don't like it because now they have people
*  that think completely different than them and they don't they can't stop them they're used to
*  silence them you used to not be able to say anything about certain things you would get kicked off and
*  now you could fully express yourself sure and you're finding out there's people you agree with there's
*  people you disagree with that is the world the world is not some fucked up echo chamber where
*  if you say you know a man is never a woman you get banned for life that happened to my friend
*  Megan Murphy she got banned for life because she said a man is never a woman which is biologically
*  true but they were like no that's transphobic for life for life for life forever bye so they don't
*  want any narrative contrary to what they have accepted as doctrine and that's what's so fucked
*  up remaining dogmatic in the face of alternate information and pushed pushed by the government
*  this is what's really important and again that's where you kind of look back and go if something
*  is being pushed by anyone right follow the money follow the track like why so they're doing it under
*  the guise of being progressive so this is why they think it's worth doing they it's like if you can
*  allow the government to censor you under the guise of them being on the good side then then you're
*  lost because then you've bought into this nonsense and you have if you just looked at it objectively
*  you have people that are still supporting the military industrial complex still supporting
*  overthrowing democratically elected governments and other countries still the same shit you hated
*  about the right and that same government you've let them into your home and you let them control
*  this most important platform of free speech on the war in the world because you think they're doing it
*  for your side which is a good it's a good thing even while they're drone bombing people in yemen
*  they don't give a fuck about you this is so stupid they're just trying to stay in power and they knew
*  that they were going to lose power if that hunter biden laptop got out they're like we're fucked this
*  could cost us 10 million votes and the wild part is i guess because it's after the fact but it
*  doesn't seem like that whole thing really really changed the scoreboard and maybe i could be
*  100 buying laptop i mean i think i think it did i think it did i don't think enough people were
*  talking about it they didn't know if they weren't if they well first of all where do people find out
*  things most people are not finding out things through the newspaper no they're finding out
*  things through social memes and if you can block it on social media they don't find out about it
*  of course there's so many things i talk to people about that's like kind of in our world like just
*  everyone knows this stuff and i'll talk to people just on the street whatever they have no idea
*  yeah most people don't have any idea and that's where i started going oh there's different
*  narratives being spun to different algorithmic groups because we're all in the truman show our
*  own little truman show 100 and we all think that we know what's going on and i'm like hey guys
*  we all have our different scoreboard somehow that's been put up so like let's just question
*  the scoreboard for a minute and learn how to communicate with people you disagree with and
*  this is the problem with these people that wanted all the right-wing voices banned from twitter like
*  hey guys that's bad for you it's bad for you yes and it's bad for your your own objectivity your
*  own understanding of the world and you need to even if someone's wildly incorrect if they're
*  wildly wrong you need to be able to know that people do think that way it's good for you yeah
*  make a good point and like let's listen yeah and i enjoy talking to people from all over and i like
*  much like yourself and i've stupidly got into some some dms with like people just like hit me up and
*  they're like hey then i'll just like well i'll ride the ride yeah and i'll ask questions and this and
*  that and the other but it was very illuminating like oh wow you're looking at a totally different
*  scoreboard a totally different game clock a whole different thing and it it makes me at least
*  question myself and go well maybe i'm watching i'm the crazy one maybe i'm no they're just a
*  cowboys fan they're a cowboys fan the cowboys can do no wrong right and you're like fuck you
*  i like the writers like whatever it is show you guys that's what it is it's teams for people who
*  don't believe in sports and that's politics for a lot of those fuckers a lot of those fuckers are
*  not into sports and they see competition i've always been super reluctant to the whole team
*  thing in the first place because when i stopped playing baseball i started fighting one of the
*  reasons why i did it was like i didn't like that little billy can drop the ball and i'm a fucking
*  loser i get it i didn't like that i get it i like to rely on myself like i've never played a team
*  sport the most relying on myself to me was like fighting i was like we have the same weight we
*  there's no trickery you're three two one go you know you're like are you ready are you ready go
*  it was like so simple to me like this is what i'm looking for this is like competition that makes
*  sense to me yeah and this idea of like joining a group of people and all of their opinions i have
*  to agree with like that's horrendous to me like that like what are the odds they're going to be
*  right what are they even in fighting so many people are so wrong in their ideas like there's
*  guys in the gym that i'll hear them giving advice like you don't need submissions you want to learn
*  submission defense like what are you talking about don't tell him that like you should shut the fuck
*  up like and this guy's a trained fighter in a gym he's telling people you just need submission
*  defense like no no no no no no no no no you need to learn how to do it so you can even defend it
*  correctly just even know what's out there that's like listening to the other side right it's like
*  hey tell me why you believe x y and z that i think is absurd but yeah give me oh wow okay well now i
*  realize you're crazy but at least i know it's also like who who are you training with where you don't
*  think that works no why don't you go train with fabrice over doom and then tell me you shouldn't
*  learn your guard you don't know what you're talking about you're talking nonsense you're saying you're
*  saying something from this very narrow-minded perspective like you can only learn so many
*  skills like no you could you should learn the whole thing right and if you can't learn the
*  whole thing you're in the wrong game because these kids that are coming up guarantee you that i watch
*  some of these kids that are coming up in the amateur ranks and they're kids that are fighting
*  in the uk and they're gonna make their way in the ufc these motherfuckers are complete and they're
*  like 18 some of these kids that are fighting in one fc they're like 17 18 years old and they're
*  complete they can do everything like you better learn how to do everything yeah you're gonna meet
*  that guy yeah that guy's out there and otherwise you're in the wrong game and if you're giving
*  advice saying you don't need to learn that like oh well that's a good like if you're ever given
*  advice if someone doesn't need to expand their horizons like that's just wrong right but imagine
*  if that guy's your coach and imagine you have a team and everyone in the team has to believe
*  that submission is bullshit building that same narrative right and then you get trapped with
*  all these meatheads that think it's just all about ground and pound and then you get triangleed
*  every weekend you're like i'm tired of getting triangles yeah well it's the same uh tribalism
*  and strength conditioning too you either get guys are like oh all the power lifting moves that's all
*  you got to do bench squat bench squat and it's like all the other guys are olympic lift you got
*  a snatch clean and jerk and everything else is stupid you're like okay guys like and i used to
*  joke i was like i could look at your shoes and i could tell you what tribe you're in and what
*  music you probably what shoes are what are the shoes that you look at converse all-stars a lot
*  of guys lift with those because they'll be west side guys it's a hardcore dude a hardcore dude he's
*  gonna run all he's gonna work run call uh converse he's gonna box squat he's gonna sumo dead why
*  doesn't converse make an all-star with a wider toe box because i try to lift and converse my
*  these are stupid they're hard they're hard to do i like a wide toe box yeah i like a vivo barefoot
*  like that but converse are good because they're flat there's not a lot of there's no push in
*  there it depends on what you're doing right if you're like more of a of a you know wide stance
*  sumo or box squat because your feet your heels aren't elevated it's actually a better situation
*  for squatting right well if you're an olympic lifter you're going to be closer so you want to
*  a heels elevated with a flexible toe and that's why you look and you're like oh okay like this
*  is what you're doing and then i kind of laugh like the guys with the cross trainers are usually
*  just dudes that do a whole bunch of crap and they're doing plyos and dancing around and whatever
*  but there's always like these little tribal things like if you're this person you're wearing chucks
*  and you're listening to pantera yeah like it's just part of the gig you know and it's always
*  funny and it's like all right some people think you have to lift heavy if you don't live heavy
*  you're a pussy oh or you have to listen to music at like 8 000 decibels to lift heavy yeah and and
*  slap your fucking thighs and scream i've danced that dance before throw the powder out of your
*  hands i've done the i've done the smelling salt of course oh we do smelling salts in here let's go
*  yeah let's roll let's go
*  is it good one huh ruff it's probably better than what i had back there's a good one and it's not
*  even uh that fresh yeah it's not even fresh that's worse worse than i remember that's juju
*  moofoos yeah yeah we don't we are um an unlicensed uh promoter of this brand yeah i know
*  yeah we used to do the little capsules and break them and that's a whole different animal
*  yeah that's it's real that's a whole jar of it yeah it's potent the fumes that come out are so
*  strong when you have a sealed bag you could smell on the outside of the bag then when you open the
*  bag you got a sealed bottle just my ears are bleeding just the smell from opening the bag is rough
*  yeah no i just what does it do does that really help you have you ever tried to lift before that
*  and then it just snaps the central nervous system kind of like you know when you're passed out right
*  does it make you a little stronger you think more mad more mad more mad i mean that's good on big
*  gross motor movements squats deadlifts i used to call like deadlifts are just how mad you were
*  they used to have the strongest man competitions all the time on esps yeah those dudes were like
*  holding on to cars all the cars and the ramps oh so cross yeah the big stones and atlas stones
*  oh so great it was fun yeah i watched them all the time in the 90s and then actually my dad was
*  uh in 1980 at the playboy club he was with bill casmeyer when he did the silver dollar deadlift
*  it was what's the silver dollar he had like 900 something pounds of these like clear boxes
*  and uh and they were filled with silver dollars oh wow it was super cool and so there's like an
*  iconic lift and and you know pops was like hanging out with those cats and but it's funny because
*  there's like a whole picture of him and i'm pretty sure i mean he was obviously training that i think
*  he's partying pretty hard too so he looks straight off of a of a ripper and uh and i was like man the
*  80s were awesome it looked like he looked like magnum pi it was awesome yeah they were just
*  learning things oh man the pioneer days basically it was so cool you always knew that if you're
*  watching the strongest man if the dude's name was magnus he was gonna fuck things up yeah yeah
*  these are for magnuson a samuelson if there's some sons involved you know one of those guys is
*  fighting mma he's been fighting at marius pudzianowski oh i remember maris yeah he went
*  from being a strong man to being like terrifying really good mma fighter i could see that in the
*  beginning he was getting fucked up but he tried to dive in right away like he tried to fight um
*  god he fought some good fighters like right away when marius was at the height because we used to
*  do a lot of a lot with the arnold strongman classic silvia that's oh my gosh did he he fought
*  tim silvia like really early on like when tim yeah so he fought tim silvia in his third pro
*  fight and he got the fuck beaten out of him yeah like that was just but i never i never fought
*  butterbean he beat butterbean he lost to james thompson and he beat james thompson oh well no
*  contest it says um yeah what a stud fought bob sap that was bob sap was like taking some kind of
*  yeah my dives my uh my buddy used to train with bob holes gracey beat holes gracey yeah he knocked
*  holes gracey out yeah so he's kind of like a bunch of like legit mma fights yeah pudzianowski was
*  like one of the first guys i ever saw that was that big that had like vascular lats so we were
*  in the backstage and it was kind of weird because like he was considerably bigger the year than
*  before and i think even taller too i was like this guy was just like well how did he get taller
*  that's why i was questioning i don't remember him being taller that's amazing the homeboy got
*  taller look at the size of that motherfucker yeah he was backstage and everyone was like big big but
*  it was like marius is in a whole different category oh he's a tank see if you can find
*  him now though he's slimmed down considerably he still looks fucking huge but um as an mma fighter
*  now he's um yeah see there see click on that picture yeah no the other one he's still terrifying
*  what above it right above it yeah but oh what year is that clearly old though oh because it's
*  blurry is it say that it's 20 years old 2002 okay see if you can find some footage of him actually
*  fighting maybe there's some i'm sure he's got some high there he is right there on his knees oh here
*  we go so he's still stiff but he's got good technique and he's got a lot of power man yeah
*  look at the muscles on the back of his neck he looks like one of those bucks during the rut
*  yeah but at least like he's he's throwing correctly hands up high and this is all
*  technical work here well it's like brian shaw's been doing a little bit of sparring with derek wolf
*  oh jesus how terrible is that what does he weigh 390 i don't know i mean i know he was up to 440
*  something at one point my dad is actually who got him in a strongman he came by our booth uh at 18
*  years old and my dad was like hey you're really strong you should like get into this yeah he
*  should be on another planet you're too big too big for this planet yeah he was probably 240
*  that makes me believe in the anunnaki right you know right there's actually giants that are that
*  like where what happened 100 how'd you get so big those dudes you remember cleave dean you ever
*  remember that guy so he was a old uh they called him like a pig farmer he was the one the one the
*  original uh world's strongest man but he was an arm wrestling champion and he was like all this
*  old like weird it's like 440 pound like just giant farmer yeah there he goes yeah that cat oh why is
*  that poor little fellow arm wrestling i mean look how big that human is jesus christ look at his
*  hand yeah oh my god yeah look at that photo that's big daddy goodrich um it was mma fighter look at
*  that the hand holding the the table in the front look at the size of that fun wild right yeah if
*  you could teach that guy to throw a jab you fuck a lot of people up i would like to see a fight
*  between him and andre the giant oh god that'd been awesome definitely wouldn't be long right right
*  did you ever meet andre no i did not that'd been cool yeah i would like to have met him i've been
*  that'd been i met hulk hogan twice did you i met him once when he was super tall and then well i've
*  met him multiple times but i met him once when he's super tall and then now he's just like regular
*  really yeah because he's lost like five or six inches of height for his back
*  oh just getting compressed back is all like fused his whole back is fused he's so fucked
*  how many surgeries did he say hi jimmy some crazy amount of backs really yeah his whole back is
*  fucked like he walked through the cane it's rough and it was because of 25 in the last 10 years
*  25 back surgery oh so he just lost all his he has had knees hips shoulders face
*  abs oh you've i'm sure you've met stalone before right yeah yeah have you all just talked like
*  random old weird stuff like no i didn't get a chance to talk to him very much i interviewed him
*  once for i think it was spike tv when i was doing the ufc thing i interviewed him he was fun he is
*  he's very similar to you and then so like wild like remembers everything from like those eras
*  of stuff and and you know gunner peterson so i was at gunner's gym in la and stalone was in there i
*  was like oh badass freaking stalone like i'm a kid of the 80s and i was like hey you know would you
*  mind he sat down with me for 45 minutes oh wow and we just talked like but he mentioned cleave dean
*  like he remembered like all the arm wrestlers the boxers like historian of the human performance
*  world it was like oh this is so cool i figured you guys had to like have nerded out about it
*  did you have you ever paid any attention to the old catch wrestling guys no what's that okay
*  catch wrestling was catch as catch can which is what they used to call it i think when it was
*  when they were in england and then when they came over to america it was called cat late what it was
*  was basically wrestling with submissions and there were certain rules like you could pin a guy
*  or you could submit them and they can tap and there was a few guys that were legendary for
*  their strength and conditioning routines no way yeah yeah josh barnett learned under carl gotch
*  and gotch was like famous for having like this unbelievable gauntlet of strength and conditioning
*  work that you had to be able to get through before he would even train you really yeah like he went
*  over to japan and gotch trained a lot of guys like there's a lot of what you know was that
*  influence well when you go back to the early days of catch wrestling go back go farmer burns
*  because farmer burns was like one of the what is this what am i watching here what is catch
*  as catch can so these guys was that they would have these that is that what was yeah back up for
*  a second so yeah hackenshmirt yeah so he's like one of the fathers of strength conditioning makes
*  sense because a lot of these hacks go all gotch and hackensmith were duking it out at kumiski park
*  and they would have uh wrestling matches but they were real matches wow and then somewhere along the
*  line they started doing carnival matches and then these carnival matches they had you know
*  regular people that they would find and they would like have predetermined outcomes then it became
*  pro wrestling and that's where pro wrestling was given birth to it was out of this necessity to
*  kind of rig the matches right but getting the wahoo chop see these are kind of enthusiasts
*  that are doing it now like in a modern setting but the the guys who really know the stuff like
*  josh barnett has tapped out some legit brazilian jiu-jitsu black belts in competition with catch
*  wrestling techniques it's like kamuras americanas like they call they call that a double wristlock
*  though they have like different terminology for some of the same moves but um farmer burns was this
*  guy that was he was so legendary with his strength and conditioning that he would hang from a tree
*  he would literally like hang himself like his neck his neck was so built up and he was a small guy
*  he was like 160 pounds but he was so jacked and his he literally had like a pit bull neck there's
*  photos of him where he would do this stunt where he would hang by the neck in front of crowds
*  right look at him that's him oh wow okay that's farmer burns okay probably very similar to the
*  mighty adam if you've ever heard of him but you know how fucking strong your neck has to be
*  and not just hang sometimes hang like all the time look at his neck that's amazing look at his
*  fucking neck but he knew that you know if your neck is weak your body's weak your core is weak
*  if someone collar ties you and you got a neck like that you can resist it and you could work
*  your shit yeah anything that hangs out of your t-shirt you better train there was a bunch of
*  those guys um back in those days that just had these incredible strength and conditioning
*  programs and they used a lot of things like steel maces yep like carl gotch was see if you can find
*  carl gotch strength and conditioning routine because even like as an older man when he was
*  teaching people stuff he would show how he maneuvered these you know these big fucking
*  aces it's like super impressive stuff yeah it just but it's maneuvering something not necessarily
*  lifting it all that functional strength stuff he would have those guys do 500 bodyweight squats
*  every day every day oh that's cool so here's him back then oh gosh and a lot of it was like
*  hindu push-ups and look how flexible he was for a big fucking giant dude yeah like super flexible
*  so they realized that you know like we're talking about technique is very important but also strength
*  yeah look at the size of his fucking thighs dude look at the neck yeah whole and so he'd make these
*  guys do these crazy wrestler's bridges and look at how you could do that like support yourself and
*  pull yourself back up like that so they kind of like and resist against necks yeah so these guys
*  would have these unbelievably grueling physical sessions and then then they do their technique
*  wow so yes they would attempt to i guess be a pre-fatigue and so you'd love to do it well also
*  you just had to be in phenomenal shape because in wrestling you know that's the first thing that goes
*  you must have ridiculous conditioning to be an elite wrestler look at the size of his fucking legs
*  dude so carl gotch was just like super famous for this he's in japan here teaching these guys
*  and obviously this is black and white it's just a long time ago yeah have you ever seen the um it's
*  who is he training here does it say who he's working with enoki that's enoki oh wow of course
*  enoki who fought muhammad ali okay you ever see that fight no oh my god it was like some crazy
*  scam fight where enoki just stand on his face dropped to his back yeah work his neck so he's
*  lifting him up with his face yeah good job carl gotch didn't fuck around dude that's obvious
*  that'll build your chin so uh enoki had this fight with muhammad ali and muhammad ali's trying to
*  punch him and enoki just goes to his back and kicks his legs so he's he fucked muhammad ali's
*  legs up like they were really fucked up for quite a while really after that yeah so this is what
*  they did he just kicked his knees and kicked his legs and ali's like what the fuck and it's in
*  japan and they're paying him a ton of money to do it so the referee has to separate him and the
*  referee is judo gene lebel no way yeah so judo gene lebel is the rest of the referee and enoki's
*  just lying on his back kicking him and he's he's kicking him with like roundhouse kicks like look
*  at this he's so he's fucking ali's legs up man that's when you're a guy who makes his living off
*  of his footwork which was ali like this was super dangerous look he's getting him in a leg lock
*  so obviously this wasn't boxing this now with some weird hybrid fight that you know i think ali just
*  needed money and they talked him into doing this but like those fights we get today is that sort
*  of like what this was going on just crazy exhibition real fights that are happening well sort of but
*  this was real enoki was really trying to hurt him he really did kick the shit out of his legs and
*  ali really see if you can find any articles on ali's legs after the enoki bout that's I think
*  he really fucked his legs up because he didn't know how to check kicks he didn't know what what
*  to even do and all of a sudden this guy's on his back roundhouse kicking his legs and stomping at
*  his knees yeah so who knows if his knees got hyper extended he tore his meniscus like who knows what
*  the fuck happened now have you ever seen there's an old polish documentary um that's them training
*  in the 1970s and they're doing all that kind of crazy stuff and uh throwing logs and he has
*  blood clots in his leg where does it say that nearly ended ali's career
*  when before i clicked on it it said it in the like the little sentences
*  finally the 15th round they called it a draw wow ali is bleeding from the legs
*  he gets an infection in his legs and he almost has to have an amputation
*  holy shit extended stay in the hospital was the best case scenario coming out of the fight
*  wow so muhammad ali is suffering two blood clots and an infection in his leg from enoki's vicious
*  grounded kicks according to the sweet science wow
*  wow when he finally did so look at this so he said he continued his tour
*  of asia despite this competing in exhibition matches in south korea and the philippines before
*  returning to the united states when he finally did get back to the u.s ali needed to stay in
*  los angeles hospital for multiple weeks to recover from injuries sustained in the enoki fight holy
*  shit man he put him on ice man they were concerned ali's injuries could even be life threatening
*  well that's staph infection he was bleeding from the legs got an infection his legs almost had to
*  have an amputation bro staph infections are fucking terrifying you had one yeah yeah about two twice
*  twice about staph not bad though i caught it both times i had a blood clot one time i got
*  jammed up smoked my ankle and i was like didn't think much of it felt like just kind of weird
*  got hot got swollen i'm competing all over the world and i'm like yeah this kind of feels weird
*  and uh the doctor's like hey man you need to get that checked up of course jumped back on a plane
*  went across the country and they said that i had a blood clot from my knee to my hip oh shit yeah so
*  it's blocking off the blood coming through yeah and my calf was giant and um what do they do
*  about that i just started taking blood thinners and stuff and so which was cool but you can't get
*  cut couldn't get cut which is kind of funny because i got on the blood thinners and i just pulled
*  alligator tag like a couple days before so i told i told the doctor i was like he's like don't do
*  anything they'll get you cut i was like well i'm going alligator hunting tonight and he's like
*  and i was like no no seriously he's like no you'll bleed out if you get bit i'm like yeah but i
*  probably won't bleed out so i remember like in the middle of the night the swamp giving myself
*  shots of whatever that stuff was in my stomach and oh my god it was i'm not very smart so uh how long
*  do you have to take the blood thinners for before it dissolves for about six to eight months whoa
*  because i started on the shots and then i went to like the war friend tabs and they had to to keep
*  checking me keep checking me because they had to let it all break out and so i'd have to once a
*  month get it ultrasounded and there's no better way can't they pull that out of there or something
*  yeah that's why i would have thought they were like you know um that's crazy it's crazy so i was
*  at christmas party a couple months later and my doctor saw me and he was like hey and he was
*  had a couple beers in him so he's like hey he's like uh you're gonna do you or you're one of your
*  descendants are gonna do something special for this world i'm like what do you mean and he was
*  like he's like you know where that blood clot should have been i go where and he just tapped
*  me on the chest he's like right there he goes no way you shouldn't have died on that one i go really
*  he goes you heated it you iced it you massaged it you flew you trained he goes you did everything
*  if you were trying to commit suicide by blood clot for months he goes how it didn't travel i have no
*  idea whoa anybody when someone tells you that you're like well that's cool i guess things are
*  gonna go awesome for a while or you just got lucky all right yeah and then what happened my um my
*  lower leg basically like they said it grew another vein so it grew a bypass around it no so it all
*  the swelling started going down and they're like yeah you one of your men like minimized veins or
*  smaller veins actually grew in in capacity and just worked his way around they're like the human
*  body will do that i'm like so it just worked his way around the bypass what would have happened
*  though if you didn't get that vein diluted with the blood thinners or that blood clot something
*  to kick loose i mean it was right at my hip it doesn't go away your body doesn't absorb it ever
*  i mean if if the uh whatever the hematocrit or whatever the blood the the thickness of the blood
*  was still of that if it ever broke loose he's like it would have gone to your heart or your head
*  that would have been a stroke or heart attack and you know but it's weird like and it was just a
*  an ankle injury ankle that's crazy smoked it it's like oh okay you know i'll be fine start walking
*  it off and what screwed me is the next day it was all black and blue the whole deal right
*  i'm walking walking walking everything's not not fine it sucked and i had to go on a business trip
*  and i was like let me go check and make sure it's not like broken that i have to get it
*  like actually fixed i went to the doctor and they're like hey you you got to mobilize this
*  thing and i'd been walking for a week and so they they wrapped it up and mobilized it and
*  um i remember i was on a plane i was sleeping and it felt like someone lit a fire in my calf
*  and i was like what was that and i went to my hotel room i filled the trash can up with ice and i just
*  dumped my leg in there to cool my leg down and that was like in may and i competed at the hammer
*  world championships all the way to labor day and i was in oh my god i was in san francisco and i'm
*  like something's weird i pulled down my knee sleeve and one of the docs was there and he's like
*  what is going on with your leg i'm like i think i pulled a hamstring or something he's like
*  nah you didn't and so i came back call my guy at south carolina sports medicine and he got me in
*  right away and he's like dude you got a big ass blood clot and like you got to get this square
*  away now holy imagine if he didn't do that imagine you just just die you'd just been like hey i'm
*  one day you would have just died i would have been a 30 year old really healthy guy that just
*  keeled over and so it's like that kind of hits you and that was that was honestly kind of the
*  end of my competitive sports world because i started realizing like all i cared about was
*  winning and all i cared about was training and winning and i like i i forwent social relationships
*  being smart with my body and all this stuff because i was like no i'm going to win worlds
*  i'm going to go do this i'm going to be top blood whatever yeah and it was just like drive drive
*  drive and i was like man i didn't see this very obvious thing that could and should have killed me
*  it's like i need to grow up like i need to like refocus how i'm looking at these things and so i
*  had to mature and just like okay i've competed for 15 or 20 years or whatever it was at that point
*  it's like maybe take a pump pump the brakes for a second and just go like am i making good choices
*  for my family good choices for my business people that rely on me because if you know
*  cool in all things but if bert just kills over like you know that's not optimal for really anyone
*  it's it's interesting how you can get completely caught up in one goal to the point where you
*  don't see anything else in life and you just miss out on a giant chunk of life but if you want to
*  be the best at something it's kind of the trade-off it's the traneil brennan joke that's the trade-off
*  yep i've talked about like the the rabbit hole guy versus the 90 guy and like the 90 guy which
*  i think i've kind of turned into like if i train for something and get into something i've generally
*  found if i really care about i could be as good as 90 of the world at it like a lot of different
*  things right but if you're the guy that wants to go down there to be the best the goat you have to
*  go down so far around the rabbit hole and forsake all other things yeah to where you lose sight of
*  reality by the way you could still not make it and you could still not make it yeah you could be in
*  the same weight class as john jones right and you're just like i picked the wrong hero to be alive
*  right yeah there's mike tyson 1986 whoops so you want to be a heavyweight boxer oh no yeah yeah
*  and that's real bigs that's the weird part is like you could be the rabbit hole guy and go so far down
*  and lose sight of life and still be the number three guy ever yeah and you know yeah i kind of
*  like use like the yoda like the dagobah forest like that's where people went to get all the force like
*  they don't write books about the 90 guy right they write books about the weirdo that lived in
*  the forest there's a little green man that knew the force however though that guy might be miserable
*  might be miserable man yeah and i've seen it a lot yeah you gotta know when to stop
*  yeah it's fun to do in the beginning but you gotta know when to stop i mean i would say you're
*  probably as good or better than 90 plus percent of the human population at fighting probably
*  probably yeah you're probably better at 90 of the human population at shooting a bow
*  probably yeah probably right and so you start looking at things you're like oh the things
*  you want to be levi morgan there's a long road it's a long road it's a long road yeah long ass road
*  and like if you want to beat gordon ryan you're probably never going to catch him because he's
*  already still doing it yeah and he's not doing archery and he's not doing a podcast and he's
*  not doing a thing exactly and then so like i've had to kind of went to this thing i was like am i
*  do i want to be a 90 percent guy that enjoys semi-balance in my life and is really passionate
*  about three or four or five things and be really really good or do i want to throw all my chips in
*  and the probability is i won't be the goat right especially if it's a competitive thing right the
*  where it gets weird real tricky with some people is if maybe it's a thing that's not a competitive
*  thing and you can keep doing it yes like my friend gary clark jr when he records albums he goes crazy
*  and he locks himself in the studio and he's there for like fucking 12 hours like every day and it
*  drives his family nuts he's just like constantly working on his music because to him like he wants
*  to be all in yes like that's what that's where he lives that's where he creates this great music
*  when he's all in and you could sacrifice all the other things in your life you're not going to work
*  out you're not going to go on trips you're not going to all you're doing is just whatever that
*  thing maybe it's painting whatever maybe it's writing books whatever it is you're all in
*  and although it's beautiful i don't know if i'm that guy you don't have to be you know and i
*  saw i had to look at myself in the greater you know if you're looking at the universe if you
*  look at the greater picture of everything it's not really important what you do here in this life
*  but for you it is and the problem is if you're compelled to try to be number one and you don't
*  really chase it you're always going to have that thing in the back of your head i never really
*  went for it yes at least you went for it for a long time and that's the thing like that i think
*  is the best way go for something and then but know when to stop that's where it was yeah don't be a
*  70 year old dude out there in the olympics throwing a hammer please don't please don't
*  no he's the oldest guy whoever threw the hammer gosh well actually my one of my mentors jud logan
*  so he this dude made four olympic teams and and the hammer and then got out of it and he was a
*  coach and then every time that he would hit a 50 year 55 year or 60 year he would train for three
*  or four months break the all-time world record in that way in that age class and he would go
*  off again for five years good lord and he would just come back and he would do it again
*  and just shatter the world record and they would come back and he'd do it and he just did that up
*  until pretty much when he when he passed did he keep training the entire time like how did he be
*  able to come back and he was very genetically gifted and he would he would just he was a coach
*  so he was always doing it and screwing around and then he would get serious but then he would get
*  serious for the last little bit and all of his kids would come out of this guy's he coached
*  and i mean he was just a gosh at the end like when he was like 70 how far away was he from
*  guys who were 30 he knocked me out of the olympic trial finals in 2004 and he was 40
*  gosh he was probably 45 46 years he was like a little bit younger than me now but i was 27
*  and in my prime wow and and he would have that would have been his sixth olympic trial
*  and you're just like but it's judd right like he's a mythical bill braskey creature like he's
*  he's judd and you're just like dang it yeah judd's gonna figure out a way to figure out a way
*  and he just generally his fourth how many age-class world records did he hold uh he went 50 55 and 60
*  and then he passed away a couple years ago actually he got uh had cancer and then he had some code
*  coded complications it sucked man i mean you talk about a guy that's just that statuesque like best
*  conversationalist like poured into all these kids and stuff and just like he's the coach you always
*  wanted to have you know and you're just like ah but things happen it's interesting when you watch
*  the way different people live their life because you can see benefits and you could see where it
*  would be a detriment to the rest of your life and it allows us to look through these
*  mythical creatures like that guy these john jones type characters these carl gotchas and go
*  but is that what i want to do correct you should know what you want to do don't get tricked into
*  doing something you don't want to do because there's people out there that really want to
*  do that and if you don't really want to do that you're never going to beat them anyway ever ever
*  you're already most likely not going to right already most likely not going to but if you're
*  not really sure you're dead in the water you got one foot in guess what bitch you're gonna get that
*  foot's gonna be snatched up by a crocodile one foot in the grave and one in a roller skate yeah
*  you can't you can't compete with a really obsessed talented person if you're not really obsessed and
*  talented and the weird part is is when you you look at yourself and kind of question that like
*  am i a 90 guy and some people aren't either some people are like i don't care what happens man
*  i'd be average and that just sounds horrible right yeah that doesn't sound like you're gonna get
*  anywhere and you're not going to be interesting not in the least yeah that's that's the problem
*  like you're not going to attract other interesting people because they're not going to want to be
*  around you right and the biggest part really funny well that's helpful yeah the biggest part
*  about being interesting is being interested right you know ask a lot of questions be interested
*  yeah like yeah that's where i think you're one of your superpowers besides you have a steel trap
*  for a brain you've recalled things that we've talked about like i was like i didn't know he
*  was listening to that that's pretty impressive but um the thing is when you come to that like
*  am i a rabbit hole guy am i 90 percent guy in my opinion those are the only two choices like the
*  other ones just screw those but when you kind of like really look at like have you ever seen like
*  where your line really is my line your line like when like you're like i i will go this far
*  but that's as far as i'll go right like down that rabbit hole to whatever that is or whatever
*  stressor or whatever that may be and uh it's weird i hadn't done it and and in recent like
*  i had an experience it was like okay there's my line okay that's that's well what did you do
*  i was in africa and um and and i was hunting cape buffalo which is the most dangerous thing
*  it kills a bow or a rifle rifle but still it it's one of those things you get in there close and
*  everyone's like go with the boat right oh you could die yeah you die it was pretty hairy it
*  kills more people and everyone you know we had an awesome they're actually awesome we did the
*  inner loins that night yeah in namibia it was fantastic and that cool part about that is we
*  donated the meat uh to the local village and they were super stoked wild part is after we gutted it
*  there's like you know 400 pounds of guts on a buffalo and i'm like are y'all gonna like truck
*  this out to the desert or out to the place and like let the hyenas and they're like no the
*  villagers are taken i was like the guts and they said yeah no like there will be a party tonight
*  no no running water hearts lungs liver stomach you know guts and they go they will be so excited
*  to get that and so that was a for me i go oh we think we understand poverty we think we understand
*  in this country like what not having we're like oh yeah i didn't have a whatever like no this
*  village is stoked to get 400 pounds of guts off a cape buffalo that's been laying in in the woods
*  dead for the last 10 hours really they were pumped old guts old guts old hot guts
*  we put a tarp over it so before we could get back out there to get the bull out of the you know out
*  of the jungle or whatever it would be called so so it didn't get super hot we struck a big black
*  2 000 pound animal what are they doing with the guts how are they eating it they said they'll
*  wash out all the fluids are all the guts shit and everything else and they'll put it on the grill
*  and fry it and do all this like they said protein does not go to to waste in africa at all so like
*  you guys are going to of course eat a heart but they're like yeah they're eating heart lungs
*  liver kidneys like anything like what does lungs taste like boy i don't know i don't know if i want
*  to know i've always thought about it yeah yeah because like when you yeah open up an elk you
*  look at it like can you eat this like what does this taste like are you eating heart i'm sure yeah
*  oh i eat hearts every time i love heart i eat lung i mean liver other i eat the liver and i eat the
*  heart yeah but you know it seems like lungs are no i've never heard anybody and then stomach and
*  stomach line i guess that's what what haggis is right isn't it haggis lungs and you know what i
*  know a lot of guys do they take the caul fat from the and then they chop up meat and then they'll
*  wrap it in the caul fat and put it on the grill renella did that yeah that looked really good
*  season it and then wrap it in caul fat and then slice it open we ate the inner loins and they
*  were really good but they were talking about how the the villagers out there they're like yeah all
*  this meat that these hunters get like it all goes to the villages i'm thinking people understand like
*  how much that changes the game so when you say your line what did you mean by that well they had
*  another another opportunity uh to do a lion hunt oh yeah i'm not interested that was my line it was
*  like yeah for multiple reasons well first of all you're not going to eat it right you could i mean
*  i know dudes you eat mountain lion it's delicious mountain lion is actually really good according
*  to everybody that i know that's eating it they're not lying yeah there's people that are iffy on
*  bear i enjoy bear the rivets of course they they know how to cook it yeah but the reality of a
*  lion is i don't think anybody's out there eating african lines yeah right and they're just a
*  multitude i mean they're a big i mean i got nothing against a lion to start with they're too cool
*  they're cool but they're they're big they're scary they hide really well they're really fast
*  they're dope there's a lot of stuff you'd be pumped they've if you like if somebody put one of those
*  in a movie like what a cool awesome animal you know so it's just like okay like for multitude
*  of reasons like i'm i'm a hunter guy enjoy it's like okay not that one okay and then not this and
*  then you start looking at even training you're like hey i'll do this but i won't do that right
*  and um i don't want to shoot anything i'm not going to eat i'm not interested in that
*  i'm not interested in going to hunt something that's inedible i just don't get it i get how
*  people want to do it but i feel like the same about fishing like i don't want to catch stuff
*  that you can't eat yeah you fish a good bit don't you yeah i love fishing favorite thing to fish
*  um i mean if i really had the time and i don't it would be like salmon fishing in a river
*  that's some of the most fun because they're so big and they're so strong and the way they jump
*  and there's something about rivers like oceans cool i love ocean fishing but it's like less
*  personal there's something about being on a small boat on a river and you hook a salmon
*  you see it jump like my friend ari and i went up to uh anchorage a few years back and we did a show
*  we did some salmon fishing it was really fun and then i've done a lot of uh trout fishing
*  i love bass fishing yeah bass fishing is always fun top water yeah oh yes yeah late summer
*  watch them smash that that's the best big frog going across the lily pad it's fun yeah have you
*  ever done a um i probably would be a bad idea for you but like i put a uh green light under my dock
*  in my house oh wow dude cheat code oh and they all come to it the coolest thing oh yeah send this in
*  in the uh spring and you know february through march april and then right now they're happening
*  again the striped bass will school under it oh whoa and it's like you know you're catching
*  four to 15 pound fish every night every night and so i'll sit up at the house and i'll uh
*  yeah no seriously so i'll be with the wife and she will have a glass of wine i was like all right
*  we'll go to bed and i was like well i'm gonna go fish she's like you're going fishing now so i'll
*  be back don't worry and because you only get like two or three casts before they blow off the light
*  but you're going to catch two or three fish every night on the first two or three casts
*  oh wow which is awesome well it's a great way to get food yeah no so you're gonna catch a seven or
*  eight pound striper gut and throw them in the ice and then do it so i would literally fish catch my
*  two or three fish and sometimes i got him one of those fly fishing forms so you catch like a
*  10 pound striper on a fly rod which is badass dude i went to mexico once and we uh went mahi
*  mahi fishing yeah and then they cooked it within an hour of us catching it i was like oh my god
*  this is so much better than any fish i've ever had before and then you realize that the more time
*  it waits after it's dead it goes to supermarkets it's on the shelf you lose all that you lose it
*  the flavor of them right when they pull it i'm like this is the best fish i've ever had in my life
*  it's incredible yeah it was so delicious yeah yeah yeah that's the best you you need to get one
*  those those green lights under dock sounds like fun oh man deep glow is the one yeah i'll send
*  you the link for it okay super easy to do and mine kicks on right before before dark oh nice
*  and uh or if you get up early because they had the longest time to school on it so they're like
*  everything's silent you go out there and smash a couple sun comes up it's great oh that's a good
*  move no it's it's and then it is a kid's too because then right it makes you actually a bad
*  fisherman because after that you're just like i don't feel like going out like i'll just catch
*  them tonight right and then everyone starts like marking your spots it's like the guys out here
*  that hunt over deer feeders yeah yeah it works it does work it works but they'll tell you like
*  well we hunt but yeah it's kind of like farming yeah it's fun yeah it's just different yeah it's
*  not elk no it's definitely i mean you're sitting down the whole day waiting eating chips it's good
*  it's a good time to check or catch up with emails talk to your friends yeah yeah that's the there's
*  a lot of that like the ground blind guys like to sit in ground blinds all day it's a totally
*  different thing i did this morning yeah it's fun i did yeah i enjoyed it it's all it's fantastic
*  it's a great way to pig hunt oh yeah you know i stuck one two nights ago the thing about pigs
*  out here too is like they actually have to hunt them yes it's like you're you're actually doing
*  a service to the environment by getting food yeah and if you get a good butcher that can turn that
*  into sausage it's fucking fantastic yeah my actually my little boy he killed his first pig
*  last week uh he's eight years old what was it like when you ate it it was awesome we did
*  it for thanksgiving when he was like wow he's so super cool so we yanked the backstraps out we uh
*  i marinated in coke for like six uh 36 hours coca-cola coca-cola really yeah i kind of broke
*  it down i learned that from jen rivett so she would do bear with like dr pepper no kidding yeah
*  and they know how to cook some bears i mean you know that work you know yeah so we did that and
*  then like made a kind of butter and all this kind of cool kind of kind of drizzly deal wrapped it in
*  bacon could wrap pork and bacon and then put on the grill is freaking awesome do you know that
*  guy he's a cook he's on youtube what is it his name guga guga foods he's always cooking steak
*  like different ways to cook steak but the other way he did it uh the other day was he marinated
*  in buttermilk for like a week what yeah took a steak marinated in buttermilk for a week and like
*  when he pulled the steak out you could see like the buttermilk was breaking the steak down that's
*  a guga foods that dude see if you can find his buttermilk steak one oh he's cooking a brisket
*  in coca-cola this guy is every human way possible to cook a steak this guy's done it like everything
*  cook a steak i am a reverse sear guy same yeah i i got taught that by uh chad from whiskey bent
*  barbecue um he says that the best way particularly for wild game it's without a doubt it's the best
*  way for wild game take it and so here it is with buttermilk so he did it one for 24 hours and he
*  did one of them where he he sat in the buttermilk for a week and he said it was sensational maybe
*  you want to try it hey look at that oh yeah buttermilk just pull we do that with ducks
*  afterwards then pulls out a lot of a lot of stuff out there yes this guy knows how to cook some
*  fucking steak yeah let's do it my way is uh i like to use the either a traeger or the best way honestly
*  if i have the time is uh i use an offset grill with actual hardwood sure so i'll cook you know
*  get some live oak in there and i'll get it up to about 250 degrees and then i'll put the steaks in
*  there with meter thermometers and i get it internally up to about 120 yeah and then either
*  i sear it on a cast iron pan or i also have one of those um infrared things what are those called
*  again fuck they sent it to me i should shout them out um i know who uh sean baker uses them all the
*  time but it's like a tray sean's awesome it's right yeah he's great and it runs on gas and
*  you just slide it in there and it's like an overhead grill what is it called auto wild grill
*  that's it auto wild grill how about sean being a freak for eating a bunch of meat and being a giant
*  70 years old he's fucking throwing insane weight around no trt no nothing i remember him from the
*  throes days oh do you really used to compete oh yeah big fucking dude he's a monster and he's
*  very smart you know and anybody who says you can't only eat meat you need to pay attention to him
*  because that's all he eats and he looks super fucking healthy and he's doing jujitsu and
*  training and you know he's he's older than me yeah he was at uh he spoke at summer strong last year
*  and came in and then he was deadlifting with everyone he pulled like a six something deadlift
*  and then like 400 for 25 reps or something like that and he's just like hey i'm gonna go have
*  another steak i'm like and got me kind of on it eat steaks all day long that's all he eats he
*  doesn't even take vitamins i don't think i know you've done carnivore i was actually i actually
*  called shawn about it because i was like all right i need to like give this a whirl but it's
*  worth it it's worth doing yeah yeah it's legit yeah yeah i mean i don't i don't do it all the time
*  you know i'll eat pasta if i feel like it i'll have vegetables if i feel like but i would say
*  90 of my food is meat yeah meat or eggs meat or eggs i think that's the most nutrient dense food
*  my body reacts better when i'm not running on carbohydrates i'm running on ketones or
*  you know when your body processes protein and turns it into glucose which is like just more
*  regulated for me for me you know you do whatever you want but i would say try it if you're a person
*  that eats meat i would say give it a shot just give it a month one month i did one time i lost
*  12 pounds i felt fucking great i had all this energy and i was like oh okay i'm poisoning myself
*  i'm like limiting my limiting my performance at least my mental performance right yeah i started
*  getting on it a month or two ago just a bit i was like yeah i give it a shot i was eating a ton of
*  venison but gosh i love blackberries blackberries and cottage cheese i think are like the weirdest
*  thing that i just i could eat it i don't think there's anything wrong with fruit yeah you know
*  that's like all saladinos move i eat fruit so what paul does is he incorporates fruit honey and raw
*  dairy with meat okay and then shawn just eats meat yeah you know but i can't imagine an argument
*  where fruit's bad for you i would say don't eat all the fruit right that's the problem i could have
*  a couple oranges or have a couple bananas or a bowl of blueberries with some yogurt why is that
*  bad it can't be bad can't be bad right no they're they're good for you they're they're filled with
*  vitamins they taste good it's like it's also it's enjoyable to eat a piece of melon it tastes good
*  it's fun again i'm not trying to be the goat at not eating blueberries i think the number one
*  thing is don't eat bullshit and when you go on a carnivore diet you are automatically cutting out
*  a lot of bullshit you're cutting out a lot of like enriched wheat and processed fucking grains and all
*  this bullshit and you're cutting out pesticides that might be on your your shit there's a lot of
*  things you're cutting out when you're just eating steak yeah yeah yeah do you eat a lot of white
*  tailed or no yeah sure yeah i mean if i get one sure i have one in the freezer now 19 elk a year
*  yeah too but i got an i got two white tails last year too i turned them into sausages and yeah
*  i you know cooked the back straps and butter and garlic oh back straps of butter and garlic that's
*  one that i a lot of times i just like to cook on a cast iron pan yes especially white tail there's
*  something about yep white tail tenderloins with butter and garlic that is hard to beat that's my
*  kid's favorite food so hard to be yeah a little salt garlic yep butter cracked pepper oh so stupid
*  good oh my god yeah my son and i will eat like easily a full loin like you feel fantastic it's
*  unbelievable you feel the vitamins in the meat you know it's like that's what an animal is supposed
*  to make you feel like when you eat it white tail gets a like a bad news oh just a white tailed
*  white tails are great people are silly yeah they are well people are so silly when it comes to
*  i know people don't even eat their elk they don't eat their elk they go elk hunting and then they
*  donate it to the church a lot of work for they just like to hunt which i mean i guess it's okay
*  because you're providing people with free food and it doesn't go to waste but it's the best food in
*  the world and you're not eating it yeah the best that seems so crazy to me yeah yeah you know i
*  cook up every week i cook up like a bunch of elk meat a bunch of different ways and then i have it
*  in the fridge so that's my meal prep for the week i saw that do you eat it cold or cold with hot sauce
*  is that what i like to do i like to take a plate a plate all right put some meat on there dump some
*  hot sauce on the plate and just dip it in the hot sauce and eat hot sauce any specific well i like
*  it hot um i actually have my own uh little collaboration i did with senior lechuga i saw
*  that yeah three different hot sauces one of them uh comes from my friend andrew a half face blades
*  he had one it was so good but i said can i include that one because i'm doing a collaboration we made
*  an agreement so it's like it has the half face blades logo on it as well that's with um sun dried
*  peppers i saw that tell you what all the stuff is see go to the senior lechuga i made my son uh i got
*  andy to make me a half face blade for me my dad and my two boys so they all matching and the goal
*  of it was you either carry your dad's your son's or your or your brother's knife so we all switch
*  oh that's cool and i cut my uh my son who's eight years old now i cut his umbilical cord with his
*  knife which is yeah which is weird i said that heavy yeah it was awesome i rubbed his first drop
*  of blood into the handle give him that knife so heirloom tomatoes winter truffle and reapers
*  now we're talking yeah that's andy's and that one fucking rules but the other one's rule too the
*  habanero erfa chili paprika that's a fucking banger and but these are hot hot where can i buy these
*  now senior lechuga.com so we see no lechuga hot sauce awesome have you ever done a deer leg
*  if you can't i'm not like a hot hot tasty it's tasty okay it's gonna fuck you up if you're not
*  ready like that yeah it's real like he that that guy makes hot sauce it's it's got reapers in it
*  like it's legit it kicks your ass i sweat my kids make fun of me because you know bald so like when
*  i sweat it's pouring down my face right they're like what is wrong with you it's like i'm a
*  sweater have you ever done a deer leg like the flip-flop style have you ever seen the uh what do
*  you mean andy flip-flop guy i have to cook it for you sometime so badass so you get a deer leg with
*  a shank still on it super hot grill um put it on the coals like well the grill is like hot as shit
*  okay 1100 degrees like cooking right when you blast it so he has a special sauce and his
*  granddad i believe started it it's a special sauce that's like uh the way to flip flop yeah
*  best way to grill venison all right let me see what you got yeah so you basically get this sauce you
*  mix it with um you mix it with wine you paint it with a rosemary brush you salt and pepper it
*  and then you flip it you just put it down on the grill 30 seconds okay while you're cooking that
*  side you're painting the other side salt and pepper and you flip it you shave the first quarter inch
*  and then so that size and so the long as it takes you to shave the first quarter inch repaint it
*  re-salt and pepper it and then you flip it and so when you're in it you're in you're going to consume
*  an entire deer leg in the next hour and a half and you're in the you're in it oh you know what
*  that's so freaking good that's like brazilian steakhouse exactly like a chew-hawks but it just
*  boom boom boom boom so we'll do it at parties and you're like you get a couple dudes get your boys
*  and you're all drinking suburban yeah oh look at that yeah and just slicing pieces oh that looks
*  so good man that looks sensational it's ridiculous oh my god he taught me how to do it and i've
*  actually gone to a couple events and like helped him out but i've cooked him at birthday parties and
*  oh that's a great idea it's so dope you know what i'm gonna do i'm supposed to hunt with renella
*  in march maybe we'll try that yeah if you want me know i'll freaking cook one for you i'm sure
*  you could do that with any other wild game too yeah we've done it with sheep we've done elk is
*  kind of a monster well it's such a big leg yeah but if you have a smaller sort of that is that's
*  the that's the move and now you'll paint it and then you'll salt pepper in it big ass knife like
*  that so you don't burn your knuckles that looks fucking great it's insane and what is in the sauce
*  he won't tell me exactly but it's come on andy get with it he won't tell you but how bullshit is
*  that it has all kinds of so there it is um two bottles of private reserve are flagship sauce oh
*  it's the sauce well it's the sauce bottle it won't tell you what's in the sauce right one bottle of
*  red wine cabernet or zinfandel will work depending on if you're non-binary salt and pepper to taste
*  one quarter cup to one half bottle of rosemary infused olive oil but that's a big gap quarter
*  cup to a half bottle it's like a glug glug glug yeah drink bourbon three to four loaves of french
*  bread several sprigs of fresh rosemary it's awesome sounds pretty fucking good dude it's
