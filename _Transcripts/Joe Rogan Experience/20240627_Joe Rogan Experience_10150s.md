*  Yeah, they're all living down here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=58.0s)]
*  That's dope man. Austin's pretty dope. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=60.0s)]
*  Austin's dope right now. It's a great spot. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=62.0s)]
*  I popped in here yesterday to Austin. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=64.0s)]
*  I feel like I didn't used to be able to do this, but yeah, it was dope man. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=68.0s)]
*  I got to go do a spot at the creek and then I got to go to your spot and got to do the little boy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=74.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=78.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's been dope man. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=80.0s)]
*  Austin's like, it's a new thing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=82.0s)]
*  It's like an exciting thing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=84.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it used to be like before COVID, Austin was, as far as Texas goes, Austin was like the place to go if you were too scared to like go to New York or LA. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=86.0s)]
*  People were like, just go to Austin, you know? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=96.0s)]
*  They stayed busy, but it was also like very woke. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=98.0s)]
*  And so you had to be like real careful. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=100.0s)]
*  And now it's like, no, it's just. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=102.0s)]
*  Buck wild. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=104.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=106.0s)]
*  I like that. Yeah, it's buck wild. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know what it is? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=110.0s)]
*  It's Kill Tony. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=112.0s)]
*  Kill Tony's because Kill Tony's here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=114.0s)]
*  That show, it sets the standard because it's all just about being funny. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=116.0s)]
*  And people realize like this idea that you're supposed to have like some sort of fucking social message in your comedy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=120.0s)]
*  Yeah. I also think it's just a lot of Californians and New Yorkers as well. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=130.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm down here to be able to actually be on stage from New York or LA during COVID. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=136.0s)]
*  And yeah, I feel like when they got here, they were like, you know, be careful. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=142.0s)]
*  But everybody from California, New York was just like, no. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=146.0s)]
*  Well, it depends on where you're from. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=150.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, there's there's pockets of people that are like enchanted by the wokeness in all sections of the country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=152.0s)]
*  You know, it depends. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=160.0s)]
*  Like if you're coming from the comedy store, it's just about being funny. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=162.0s)]
*  But if you're coming from some of the other clubs in LA, maybe it's not like it's just it's Hollywood, man. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=164.0s)]
*  It's like movies and TV. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=170.0s)]
*  They're all run by executives and you have to think like they think or you don't get hired. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=172.0s)]
*  Well, I think I think another reason that it got so book wild, though, is because during COVID, if you were coming here, it's because you are already like, man, fuck the fucking COVID rules. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=176.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? If you're really that safe person, you're probably also that like woke comedian. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=187.0s)]
*  So I feel like those people stayed back while everybody who was ready to get book wild came down to book while I think you I think you nailed it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think you nailed it because the people that came here like fuck this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=200.0s)]
*  Like fuck telling me that I can't do stand up. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=204.0s)]
*  Fuck telling me I can't go to a restaurant. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=206.0s)]
*  Yeah. Especially when you go on the road and you realize that if you just live in LA and you never leave LA, you think the world is LA. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=208.0s)]
*  And then you go to Nashville and you go, oh, they haven't lost their mind. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=214.0s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't lose their mind in Nashville. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=218.0s)]
*  They were normal. Like you go to Dallas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=220.0s)]
*  They didn't lose their mind in Dallas. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=222.0s)]
*  People kind of got a little freaked out for COVID for a couple of weeks and everybody sort of just settled in. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=224.0s)]
*  California never settled in, man. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=230.0s)]
*  It never settled in. It's still there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=232.0s)]
*  I've been seeing people with masks on this week. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=234.0s)]
*  I see that a lot, too. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=237.0s)]
*  I remember when like when I came down to Austin a few times during COVID to a lot of the comics from like LA, you were like, Jesus Christ. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=239.0s)]
*  Like they were they were like waiting on you to like rise with your club, dude. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=248.0s)]
*  I was like, you guys are putting too much pressure on Joe Rogan. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=253.0s)]
*  It's a lot of pressure, bro. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=255.0s)]
*  Because I think I think it's not all LA comics, but there were a few that maybe felt like the Austin comics weren't showing love to the LA comics. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=256.0s)]
*  They were like, man, they put us last on the mics. They don't book us on the shows. LA comics got to do our own thing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=266.0s)]
*  He's like, but they were like, just wait, man. I heard a couple of guys say this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=271.0s)]
*  They were like, just wait, man. When Joe opens up his club, it's over. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=274.0s)]
*  Like, we'll be back on top. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=278.0s)]
*  But I feel like you brought everybody together, man. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=280.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's about everybody should be together. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=282.0s)]
*  This is a fun artist community and it should be fun for everybody. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=285.0s)]
*  There's no us versus them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=289.0s)]
*  Shut up. We're all comics. Stop with the silliness. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=291.0s)]
*  The Austin comic, LA comic. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=294.0s)]
*  It was only for I think it was only for a little bit during COVID when everybody's just rushing in. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=296.0s)]
*  Everybody was freaking out just about change in the world. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=300.0s)]
*  You know, like there was a lot of weird shit going on in the world and everybody had a higher level of anxiety. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=303.0s)]
*  And to take a chance when you're young and you're coming up and everybody tells you LA is where you have to be. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=309.0s)]
*  Are you a 27, 28 year old comic? Oh my God, you got to get to LA. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=314.0s)]
*  That's what I had always heard. You got to get to LA. You got to get to LA. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=318.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's not the case anymore. That's not real anymore. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=321.0s)]
*  The thing that helps you more than anything is podcasts. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=326.0s)]
*  That's the thing that helps you more than anything. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=329.0s)]
*  Yeah. Number one, social media podcasts. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=331.0s)]
*  You know, those are like, look how big you got so quick from a couple clips. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=334.0s)]
*  Yeah, just a couple clips. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=339.0s)]
*  You know it as well as anybody. If you've got good shit, now it gets out like that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=341.0s)]
*  There is not a TV show in the world that would have done that for you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=347.0s)]
*  You would have had to be the star. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=350.0s)]
*  Like if you were living in the 90s, you'd have to be the star of some NBC sitcom to sell the kind of tickets you're selling right now. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=352.0s)]
*  Just from clips online. It's beautiful. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=359.0s)]
*  For comedians, it's the greatest thing that's ever happened. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=363.0s)]
*  I feel like it's letting people decide who gets to blow up. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=367.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=374.0s)]
*  I don't know what it used to be like because I wasn't there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=375.0s)]
*  But I feel like it used to be the industry kind of decides when you get your break or not. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=379.0s)]
*  Do they put you on this show or that movie? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=383.0s)]
*  They sort of do, but stand-up has always at least partially been a meritocracy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=385.0s)]
*  You know, stand-up, the quality of your stand-up is the most important thing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=391.0s)]
*  When there are not people laughing, that's the most important. It's always been the most important thing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=395.0s)]
*  So if someone is undeniable, they always come through. They always come through. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=399.0s)]
*  But they also have to be a hard worker. You've got to actually put it... [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=404.0s)]
*  There's too many guys that are really good that just go to one club or they don't go on the road. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=408.0s)]
*  There's too many guys that miss this window of opportunity where they could have been real national headliners. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=415.0s)]
*  And they just never developed a following out there in the world. They're fucked up. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=422.0s)]
*  100%. I know a handful of comics like Back Home or in New York or L.A. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=428.0s)]
*  who I feel like are some of the funniest people in the world and don't have a lick of work ethic. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=434.0s)]
*  So the world will never know. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=439.0s)]
*  It's horrible. But some of them, it's not the work ethic. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=441.0s)]
*  Some of them get jobs in the business like they're writers or like Owen Smith, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=445.0s)]
*  who is one of the top 20 stand-up comics alive. Owen Smith is a fucking killer. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=450.0s)]
*  His shit is so tight. He's so smooth on stage. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=456.0s)]
*  You look at him, you're like, how is this guy not selling out arenas? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=461.0s)]
*  How is this guy not selling out arenas? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=465.0s)]
*  It's because Owen had great jobs. He got a bunch of great jobs. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=467.0s)]
*  He runs sitcoms and stuff, runs shows. He's a writer. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=471.0s)]
*  But goddamn, when you look at the quality of his stand-up, you should be everywhere. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=475.0s)]
*  You should be everywhere. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=480.0s)]
*  I mean, to each their own. If he's happy, he's happy, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=482.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the writer's strike probably freaked him out. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=485.0s)]
*  I think the writer's strike and the actor's strike freaked a lot of those guys out. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=488.0s)]
*  They're like, oh shit. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=491.0s)]
*  Because if they just pulled a plug for five, six months in some sort of contract negotiations, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=492.0s)]
*  like some of those executives were literally saying, wait these people out when they start losing their homes. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=498.0s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. Yeah. That's some cutthroat shit. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=504.0s)]
*  That's wild. Imagine if you got to go to work with those people after that. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=507.0s)]
*  Imagine you know that's how they feel about you. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=511.0s)]
*  I couldn't do that. I mean, I already didn't go that route. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=513.0s)]
*  I don't know if I could ever go that route. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=516.0s)]
*  You could have gone that route in the 90s. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=518.0s)]
*  In the 90s? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=520.0s)]
*  That was the only option, man. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=521.0s)]
*  In the 90s, when I first came to Hollywood in 94, that was what everybody wanted. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=523.0s)]
*  You wanted what Jerry Seinfeld had. You wanted what Roseanne had. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=528.0s)]
*  It was Brett Butler who's, what was that show called again? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=532.0s)]
*  Grace Under Fire. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=535.0s)]
*  Grace Under Fire. That was a big show. Tim Allen. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=537.0s)]
*  You wanted to be a comic that got a sitcom. That was the shit, dude. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=539.0s)]
*  If you were a comic that got a sitcom, now you got a house in Beverly Hills. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=543.0s)]
*  You're fucking ballin' out of control. You're driving a Ferrari. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=547.0s)]
*  Whoa! You made it. That's what everybody wanted. This was like the goal. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=550.0s)]
*  And somewhere along the line, I think it was like the 2000s, reality shows came around. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=553.0s)]
*  Everybody wanted a reality show? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=561.0s)]
*  They're so cheap to make. They're so cheap to make. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=563.0s)]
*  And you don't, I mean, you have like, you barely pay the people that are on them. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=567.0s)]
*  Like all those real housewives and shit, they're not like making millions of dollars, I don't think. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=572.0s)]
*  You think they are? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=576.0s)]
*  I don't know. Now I'd like to know just so I can talk shit to them. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=577.0s)]
*  I think like maybe the new ones do. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=581.0s)]
*  Like obviously the Kardashians make a shitload of money, right? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=583.0s)]
*  But I think they own their show. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=586.0s)]
*  But what about like... [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=588.0s)]
*  The point is like they're way easier to make than a sitcom. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=589.0s)]
*  Way easier. Like Fear Factor was complicated in the stunts and all the stuff they had to do. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=593.0s)]
*  But you don't have to write a script and like all that stuff like plays out on its own. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=599.0s)]
*  It's like people competing. It plays out. The drama just happens. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=604.0s)]
*  And you have good editing, good music and all that shit. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=608.0s)]
*  But a sitcom, man, to write a good one? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=611.0s)]
*  Bro, that shit is brutal. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=613.0s)]
*  Yeah, props to writers, man. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=615.0s)]
*  Props to writers. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=617.0s)]
*  Props to writers. I don't know. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=618.0s)]
*  That's a hard gig. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=619.0s)]
*  TV in general just kind of scares me. Acting, writing. I don't know. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=620.0s)]
*  You're just so attached to like other people's opinions of you. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=624.0s)]
*  Like you're constantly getting chosen for stuff. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=630.0s)]
*  I feel like even though I've never done that, I do get tired of like comments. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=634.0s)]
*  Like I know they say never read the comments, but I'll read them. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=640.0s)]
*  But it'll be like the like I can take a joke. I can take getting roasted. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=643.0s)]
*  Especially with people who follow me. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=646.0s)]
*  It kind of feels like, oh, well, I mean, they follow with some sort of support. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=648.0s)]
*  It feels like you're getting roasted by like your cousin. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=651.0s)]
*  Like, hey, still on my team. Fuck it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=653.0s)]
*  But the ones that like piss me off, like I don't know why they shouldn't, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=655.0s)]
*  but they just throw me over there like I want to fucking hit this guy in the face. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=659.0s)]
*  It is like if I just left, like let's say I did Miami last month or like two weeks ago, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=662.0s)]
*  and then I post like a flyer for next month's shows. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=670.0s)]
*  And people are like, what the fuck? You avoiding Miami? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=675.0s)]
*  I'm like, hey, dumbass, I was just there like two weeks ago. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=678.0s)]
*  Like when did you start following me asshole? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=680.0s)]
*  Like stop making me look like I don't show your city love. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=682.0s)]
*  Like you can't pay attention to that. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=685.0s)]
*  That's just someone who doesn't look at schedules. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=687.0s)]
*  I hate it. Yeah, but that's like just he just that's a crazy person. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=689.0s)]
*  There's a lack of information. Yeah. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=692.0s)]
*  But I don't know why I just bugged. I stopped checking social media. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=694.0s)]
*  I'll check it like once throughout the day. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=696.0s)]
*  And if I happen to catch your message or your comment, I catch it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=700.0s)]
*  If not, fuck it. Like tomorrow. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=704.0s)]
*  You know what it's like, man? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=706.0s)]
*  It's like when you're out at like a party or a club or someone like that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=707.0s)]
*  and someone yells across the room, yo, what's up, Ralph? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=711.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and you're like, hey, what's up, man? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=715.0s)]
*  He goes, dude, I'm a fan. What's up? How you doing? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=718.0s)]
*  Then he'll give you some love. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=720.0s)]
*  But he's like checking you to see if you'll like react to him. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=721.0s)]
*  Well, somebody kind of like what they're doing in the comments. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=724.0s)]
*  Somebody come to Miami. Yeah. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=727.0s)]
*  Somebody tried to do that in like, I think it was Denver. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=729.0s)]
*  I was already pretty drunk and I was tripping off mushrooms, man. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=732.0s)]
*  And I was like in a playful mood. I can't help it. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=735.0s)]
*  And some guy stopped me while I was walking out of the club. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=739.0s)]
*  And he was like, yo, Ralph. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=743.0s)]
*  And I don't know why my my first reaction instantly was just to be like, yo, Rodrigo. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=745.0s)]
*  And I didn't know who he was or nothing. I just like, like, we're guessing people's names now. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=751.0s)]
*  And he just like he went blank face. He's like, what? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=755.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'm fucking with you, man. I was like, what's your name? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=760.0s)]
*  He was like, like Eric or something. I was like, yo, Eric. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=763.0s)]
*  And then I was like, nice to meet you, bro. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=767.0s)]
*  And I was like, my bad, man. I just walked off. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=769.0s)]
*  And when we were outside, man, it was like snowy, icy. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=771.0s)]
*  We're outside and some that same. That's pretty sure was that same dude. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=775.0s)]
*  He was like, hey, Ralph. He's like, man, you pussy, bro. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=779.0s)]
*  And I was like, I was like, what's up? I was like, what's your deal, bro? What's going on? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=782.0s)]
*  I had a feeling like he was because he was still real smiley. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=786.0s)]
*  I had a feeling he was just fucking me or something. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=789.0s)]
*  I was like, what's up, man? What's your deal? He's like, what? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=791.0s)]
*  I was like, what's up, bro? What's your deal? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=793.0s)]
*  He's like, what's my deal? And I felt so cool because I was smoking a cigarette. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=795.0s)]
*  I was like, what you want to do, bro? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=800.0s)]
*  And my friend, Luis, was really drunk. That dude just loves to fight. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=802.0s)]
*  Luis was Luis pointed at my buddy, Vince, who's like the nerdiest guy in the world. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=806.0s)]
*  He's a writer for that show. This fool, super nerdy guy with glasses. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=810.0s)]
*  He's like, you see this guy, bro? He knows MMA. He doesn't, though. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=813.0s)]
*  I don't think Vince has ever been in a fight. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=816.0s)]
*  That dude was like, I'm fucking with you, man. I'm sorry, bro. I was fine. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=819.0s)]
*  But I was just kind of waiting for him to come at me. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=822.0s)]
*  Usually, if I get into a fight, I'm going to get the first hit. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=825.0s)]
*  I'm a small dude. I'm not going to risk getting knocked out on the first punch. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=828.0s)]
*  I'm not like, if he hits me, then I'll hit him. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=831.0s)]
*  If there's a fight that's going to happen, I'm fucking swinging first. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=833.0s)]
*  I'm going to lose either way, most likely, but I'm at least going to start swinging first before you knock me out. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=836.0s)]
*  But I wanted him to come to me because it was so snowy and icy. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=840.0s)]
*  I was like, if I start walking, I'm going to fucking slip. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=843.0s)]
*  I want him to risk slipping first before I risk slipping. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=846.0s)]
*  Yeah, ice fighting is not smart. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=850.0s)]
*  It was the day before the Netflix special came out. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=853.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm not going to have a video of me getting knocked out in the ice come out the day before the special. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=856.0s)]
*  You have to know Jiu Jitsu if you're going to fight on the ice, 100%. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=860.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=864.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=865.0s)]
*  If you're fighting someone on a slippery surface, all you have to do is grab them and you're both going to the ground. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=866.0s)]
*  All right. I'll keep that in mind. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=871.0s)]
*  Yeah, but don't fight. Don't fight, man. Don't fight on ice. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=873.0s)]
*  I feel like it's coming. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=877.0s)]
*  Don't fight with mice. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=878.0s)]
*  Let me take off my jacket. I'm getting heated just talking about this. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=879.0s)]
*  Don't fight, Ralph. You're a wild young kid. Don't do it. You've got a great career. Don't fight. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=881.0s)]
*  Don't be fighting people. If you want to fight, go to a gym. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=886.0s)]
*  I went to a boxing gym for a little bit earlier this year. I went for like two months. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=889.0s)]
*  That'd be good for you. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=894.0s)]
*  Yeah, I liked it. I want to do something different though. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=895.0s)]
*  Boxing is one of the very best things ever for relieving tension. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=898.0s)]
*  If you're fucking tense, you've got too much going on in your world, man, you just put on some good tunes. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=905.0s)]
*  I have a Wu-Tang playlist that I play when I hit the bag. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=912.0s)]
*  I'd go early in the morning for private sessions, and that's where I would put on some Wu-Tang, some RZA, RZA specifically. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=915.0s)]
*  It has that one song that like, You Can't Stop Me Now. It's like a boxing classic. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=924.0s)]
*  RZA's got so many jams. But for me, number one is Protect Your Neck. That has to be on every playlist. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=929.0s)]
*  That's like when we would drive to the arena shows, and sometimes we'd get a police escort. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=937.0s)]
*  There's something wild about cop cars with flashing lights, and you're listening to Protect Your Neck. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=946.0s)]
*  Nice. I've never had a police escort, but one time in a parking lot, I had a security guard escort. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=952.0s)]
*  They have the yellow lights. Those aren't as threatening or as fun, the yellow lights. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=960.0s)]
*  No, that's not as fun. You need blue lights. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=964.0s)]
*  It was also like a shopping center parking lot. It's not exactly an arena, but I don't know. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=966.0s)]
*  Dude, some of the best comedy clubs ever, and those little shopping center mall places, little fucking clubs that you would never imagine were great. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=973.0s)]
*  The funny bones. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=981.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. Shit. I've never been that one that's at the Mall of America, but I heard that's dope too. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=983.0s)]
*  That was like the first club I got to do when I started hitting the road. That was like our second club. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=989.0s)]
*  I don't know. It was like November, like early November of 2022. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=998.0s)]
*  Are you from Dallas? Are you from Dallas? So like Minnesota winter is a different thing, man. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1000.0s)]
*  Oh, I loved it. I love the cold. I'm tired of the heat. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1006.0s)]
*  Do you really? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1008.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so sick of the heat. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1009.0s)]
*  Oh, that's funny. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1010.0s)]
*  I finally had a reason to wear a jacket. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1011.0s)]
*  See, I grew up in Boston. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1013.0s)]
*  Oh, so you're used to the cold. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1015.0s)]
*  It's cold as fuck in Boston, and I'm like, fuck the cold. You can heat me up. That doesn't bother me at all. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1017.0s)]
*  I know people die in the cold. People die in their car in the cold. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1025.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1030.0s)]
*  In the heat, all you have to do is get in the shade, get water, don't be stupid, be in reasonably good shape, and you can get away with it. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1032.0s)]
*  If you're like woods and you have water, if it's the cold, you're fucked. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1041.0s)]
*  I love it, man. I'm skinny. I just layer up, wear like two, three jackets. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1047.0s)]
*  That's great. As long as there's a place to get warm. That's the thing. You can't survive unless you can get warm. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1051.0s)]
*  That's the difference. Everybody's worried about global warming. Global cooling is what freaks me out. Ice ages freak me out. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1058.0s)]
*  Yo, when Texas froze a couple years ago, I think I was watching a video on Instagram. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1066.0s)]
*  Somebody was just like, if climate change keeps getting worse, that will happen, but for longer periods of time or for colder temperatures. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1072.0s)]
*  If that's true, then yeah, I'm pretty scared. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1082.0s)]
*  Bro, that's all guesswork. Everyone's guessing. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1084.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely an impact. It's undeniable that human beings have an impact. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1087.0s)]
*  But here's the problem. The climate is never the same. It's never steady forever. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1092.0s)]
*  If you go back to like 1934 in, I think it was Wyoming, got to like 118 degrees. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1099.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1109.0s)]
*  Yeah, something crazy like that. God, I don't remember where I saw this. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1110.0s)]
*  I guess that's why they call it climate change. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1115.0s)]
*  It's because of the dust bowl. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1117.0s)]
*  The dust bowl. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1118.0s)]
*  What was that? I always hear about that. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1119.0s)]
*  Climate change. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1122.0s)]
*  The dust bowl. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1123.0s)]
*  This is not exactly what it was, but a lot of the bad farming and drought, it caused a bunch of bad crops. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1124.0s)]
*  So they all turned to like shit. They turned to dust. They created giant dust storms all over the western part of the country. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1132.0s)]
*  That heated things up? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1138.0s)]
*  It led to a bunch of shit in the air that caused problems with the storms and the sun and definitely did heat things up. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1139.0s)]
*  I bet they thought the world was ending right then and there. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1144.0s)]
*  That's wild. But anyway, the point is if you go back in time, when they do these things called core samples, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1146.0s)]
*  so they take this giant slab of the earth hundreds of feet down, and through that you can, you know, whatever, they do carbon testing. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1155.0s)]
*  So they know like this is from a thousand years ago. This is from 2000 years ago. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1164.0s)]
*  So when they do that, it's all over the place, man. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1169.0s)]
*  They have these charts of the temperature of the earth throughout history. Have you ever seen them? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1173.0s)]
*  They go like this all over the place, even before people. It's always been wacky. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1178.0s)]
*  I'm learning a lot, man. Learning about Hollywood in the 90s and climate change. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1184.0s)]
*  Bro, I'm here to teach. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1188.0s)]
*  This is such a one-sided podcast, man. It's not even fair. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1190.0s)]
*  No, it's not. Come on, man. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1194.0s)]
*  It's not, dude. I was thinking about that on the way over here. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1196.0s)]
*  It's a conversation, brother. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1198.0s)]
*  It is, but do you realize how like this is, like bro, it's not even fair, bro. I have everything to gain here. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1200.0s)]
*  Like me, I'm 27, right? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1207.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1211.0s)]
*  And you know, you're Joe Rogan. You got the experience. You got the podcast. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1212.0s)]
*  You got all this knowledge in the world of comedy, business. If I just listen, I'm going to learn some shit today. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1216.0s)]
*  But you, you got to talk to like a 27-year-old. Like what do you even talk about? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1221.0s)]
*  Like everything we've talked about, I'm learning. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1226.0s)]
*  Are you 27? Come on, man. I love what you're doing right now. I really do. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1228.0s)]
*  I love comics on the rise. It's exciting to me. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1233.0s)]
*  Comedy is fun. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1235.0s)]
*  I love comedy. I love good comics. And I love when people get better at shit. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1236.0s)]
*  And I love watching it. I really do. I love watching people crack. It's fun. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1242.0s)]
*  I love like- [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1247.0s)]
*  Definitely trying to get better. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1248.0s)]
*  You're fucking great, man. You're funny as shit. You're cool. You're relaxed. You're smooth on stage. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1249.0s)]
*  You got a lot going for you, man. And I love it. I love watching that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1254.0s)]
*  Sometimes I won't be smooth on stage. Sometimes I'll have a burst of energy and I'll let it out and I'll have fun that way. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1258.0s)]
*  And I could tell some of the audience is like, ah, this is fun. And some of them think I'm on drugs because they've never seen that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1264.0s)]
*  They're like, he's coked out. I'm not a coked guy though. I'm not. I want people to know that. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1269.0s)]
*  If you ever see me on stage and I'm not like super mellow and I'm actually energetic, just know it's not drugs. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1274.0s)]
*  Mushrooms maybe. Not anything else though. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1279.0s)]
*  Yeah. I know a few guys who've done like the guys who had problems with coke who did coke and then did stand up and they said it fucked their stand up up. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1282.0s)]
*  Yeah, I bet. I'm sober on stage like 98% of the time. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1291.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're smoother that way. I like a drink. I like a drink every now and again. A little puff and a drink. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1296.0s)]
*  Sometimes you need that just to kind of lose like- [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1303.0s)]
*  Just to get in the fun mood. Just we're having fun, you know? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1305.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. Sometimes you might be a little stressed depending on what's going on in your day or your week. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1309.0s)]
*  And you need like a shot, a couple hits to like take that off a little bit. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1314.0s)]
*  Just take that edge off and just say, hey, come on Ralph, enjoy this shit. You're on a fun ride. Let's go. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1319.0s)]
*  I just, I try to chill sometimes just because I know that if I do start drinking, I'm not going to stop. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1325.0s)]
*  Like I'm not like a few beers in the night. I might, if I have two shows, I might drink a beer or two before the second show. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1331.0s)]
*  I might drink another couple beers on the stage. But I'm also like, when I'm on like the west coast, from Texas to the west, my audiences are like 100% Mexican. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1338.0s)]
*  Like there's no type of mix. And if you drink in front of an all-Mexican crowd, they're just going to keep like chug, chug, chug. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1348.0s)]
*  And there's no satisfying them. Like I learned my lesson. If you chug one, you'll have to chug another. If you chug the next one, you'll be eight beers in wanting to throw up on stage. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1353.0s)]
*  More dudes are going to bring you beers. Let me get them one too. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1364.0s)]
*  Yeah. So like, so I won't drink on stage. If I do, I'll let them know like I'm not fucking, you're not, you're not doing this to me. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1367.0s)]
*  Yeah. They can take you down a rabbit hole. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1374.0s)]
*  But after the show, if I already started drinking after the show, I'll keep it going. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1376.0s)]
*  Mitzies is a fun place to be. After the shows. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1380.0s)]
*  Where? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1384.0s)]
*  Mitzies, the bar downstairs, the mothership. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1385.0s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1387.0s)]
*  Tonight, tonight after shows, we're going downstairs. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1388.0s)]
*  All right. All right. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1390.0s)]
*  It's great. Whole staff's partying, just hanging out. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1391.0s)]
*  Mitzies. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1393.0s)]
*  It's a great vibe. It's a real great sense of community and home. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1394.0s)]
*  You know, that it's a real like home base, you know. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1399.0s)]
*  You need home bases when you're on the road a lot. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1404.0s)]
*  I think you do too. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1406.0s)]
*  Keep you human. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1407.0s)]
*  That's what we used to have at the store. It was a home base. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1408.0s)]
*  All these guys that would tour on the weekends, we'd all meet each other at the bar, the bar downstairs. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1410.0s)]
*  It was a comedian's only bar. It was this beautiful bar. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1416.0s)]
*  And the bar itself was Mitzies. It was from her home. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1419.0s)]
*  And they moved it. When she moved out of her home, they moved it and they put it in this one. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1423.0s)]
*  So you knew it was like, you're holding on to Mitzies bar. This is hers. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1429.0s)]
*  You know, this is her bar. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1433.0s)]
*  Like you feel her bar when you put your hand down, when you have a drink, you set it down on Mitzies bar. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1435.0s)]
*  There was something about that, man. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1439.0s)]
*  And then we're, you know, Ron White's back there and fucking Dave Chappelle's back there. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1441.0s)]
*  Dave brings his own music sometimes. It's crazy. It's beautiful. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1445.0s)]
*  No, I fucking love that. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1448.0s)]
*  Beautiful. It's just a hang, man. And so that's what we do at the mothership. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1449.0s)]
*  Dave has good music. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1453.0s)]
*  He's always got the best music. I always have Shazam on point when Dave's here. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1455.0s)]
*  I have it set up, so I tap the back of my phone three times and Shazam pops up. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1459.0s)]
*  I just have it on the little pull down menu or whatever. I don't know what you call it. I don't want to show you my messages. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1465.0s)]
*  I got a new case. It's a little thick. I might have fucked up my tapping. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1470.0s)]
*  That was like the sweetest thing. I could tap three times. Boom, boom, boom. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1474.0s)]
*  You're going to have to work out your hands more. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1477.0s)]
*  Oh, there it goes. See, Shazam comes up. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1479.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1480.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got to get better finger strength. Got to get better. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1481.0s)]
*  You're telling me, buddy. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1483.0s)]
*  Got to work on my piano skills. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1485.0s)]
*  I imagine piano players, man. That kind of dexterity in your fingers. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1487.0s)]
*  Piano and guitar or anything you could do with your fingers like that. That's some wild dexterity that people have. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1493.0s)]
*  There's Instagram videos. I got a trick for that. There's no need for dexterity these days. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1500.0s)]
*  If you're going to play a full-on song, then yeah, you need dexterity and actual piano lessons. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1505.0s)]
*  But if you're the type of guy like me who just every now and then comes across a piano and you want to impress people, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1510.0s)]
*  there's these Instagram videos that have four keys tops. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1515.0s)]
*  If you play the keys the way they tell you, it's a simple little pattern, but it sounds like you're doing a bunch. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1520.0s)]
*  It sounds like you have dexterity. That's cool. I just like to trick people. I have no real skills. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1527.0s)]
*  Well, that's a skill. You just have a very small skill. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1533.0s)]
*  You were playing pool earlier with Jake. You can make a ball, right? That's a skill. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1536.0s)]
*  You're just not a professional pool player. That's the difference. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1543.0s)]
*  I know how to get by. I'm like Leo on Catch Me If You Can. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1546.0s)]
*  I'll get by. I'll get some money, but there won't be a real career here. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1550.0s)]
*  Well, that's one of the beautiful things about anything. You learn and then you realize how much more there is to learn. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1555.0s)]
*  I remember when I first started doing stand-up, all you're trying to do is just get a laugh. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1562.0s)]
*  All you're trying to do is figure out how to not drown up there and slowly but surely try to find things that you think are funny. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1567.0s)]
*  You're getting better over time, for sure. Everybody gets better. All of us get better. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1575.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1582.0s)]
*  There's something about that that's fucking cool. It seems to never end, man. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1583.0s)]
*  That's what I love about stand-up. I've always loved to learn. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1587.0s)]
*  I've had various jobs just for the sake of learning that specific little trade, but stand-up was the first thing that I was like, man, this is never ending. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1591.0s)]
*  I'm never going to finish learning. I'm never going to finish getting as good as I want to get. So that's the one that I really stuck to. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1601.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a beautiful thing too because you get this amazing feedback from all these people and you make them feel better. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1608.0s)]
*  When people leave a great show, they have this fucking smile on their face like, oh shit, that was great. That was so fun. That was so fun. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1614.0s)]
*  Sometimes girls want to have sex with you after. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1623.0s)]
*  That's crazy. You're bringing joy. You're just bringing joy to all these people, but you're getting better at it too. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1625.0s)]
*  Dom Herrera said that to me once and Dom at the time was in his 60s. He's like, Joe, I don't think I've ever been sharper. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1631.0s)]
*  He goes like all these sets at the store. He goes, I feel like stand-up is an amazing thing because you could just keep getting better at it. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1638.0s)]
*  I'm motivated to do more of it whether I kill or I bomb because if I bomb, I'm like, bro, I have to fix that. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1644.0s)]
*  Have you seen Ron White lately? Ron White's sober now. He doesn't drink anymore. Better than ever. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1651.0s)]
*  Yeah. Better than ever. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1657.0s)]
*  You see, that's why I want to stay sober. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1658.0s)]
*  Murdering. Murdering. I mean murdering. Ron White's a fucking assassin. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1660.0s)]
*  And he's like never been sharper. New bits, always working on new shit, constantly rolling out new material, going on tour again. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1665.0s)]
*  He was going to have a retirement party. I'm like, bitch, you ain't retiring. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1674.0s)]
*  I don't think you could retire with stand-up. I think, I mean, what do I know but. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1677.0s)]
*  He was saying that he was just going to do the club. I'll just do the mothership. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1682.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, for a while you're just going to do the mothership but you're going to get that itch. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1685.0s)]
*  I don't know what he's going through or anything but I feel like this is the type of game where you could try to retire. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1690.0s)]
*  You could try to take breaks. But man, there's no finishing this. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1698.0s)]
*  Too fun. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1701.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's just no way to finish. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1702.0s)]
*  And you're doing it with people that are like you. We're weirdos. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1704.0s)]
*  We can find other comics to hang out with. They're the most forgiving, understanding, ridiculous people. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1709.0s)]
*  Talk shit to each other all the time. Everyone's laughing. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1716.0s)]
*  That green room at the mothership, at any given night, it is just like a full-on show. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1719.0s)]
*  And we're all howling at each other. You know, Hinchcliffe's cracking on people. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1725.0s)]
*  Shane Gillis is cracking on people. Ron White chimes in. Brian Simpson dumps on people. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1729.0s)]
*  It's wild back there. We're having so much fun. Just all laughing at each other. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1735.0s)]
*  Just all falling down on the ground, slapping tables. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1740.0s)]
*  Fucking dope, man. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1743.0s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1744.0s)]
*  It's hard to like, joke, like, it's hard to go back from that. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1746.0s)]
*  Like, when you get used to talking shit with comics. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1750.0s)]
*  My group of friends that I grew up with, we talked heavy amounts of shit to each other. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1754.0s)]
*  Like, there was no line. And I feel like with comics you can do that too. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1758.0s)]
*  Everybody's just shooting the shit. But it's tough sometimes, like going home or trying to like... [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1762.0s)]
*  Like, I've dated people where I meet their family or whatever. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1768.0s)]
*  And you start to get a little comfortable. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1771.0s)]
*  But you forget that they have... Their line is way fucking... [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1774.0s)]
*  Way, way, way, way down the road. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1779.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm like, fuck. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1782.0s)]
*  You passed their line in the third grade. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1784.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've said some jokes in front of the family of girls I've dated or something like that. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1786.0s)]
*  Where they're just like, holy shit, man. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1791.0s)]
*  I'm like, all right, my bad, my bad. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1793.0s)]
*  It's tough to go back. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1795.0s)]
*  But sometimes I kind of miss that too, to be around somebody who's like, not a comic. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1797.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know. My uncle has a body shop. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1802.0s)]
*  And sometimes there's just random dudes that will go hang out. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1805.0s)]
*  Dudes that are getting their cars painted there. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1811.0s)]
*  And sometimes I like miss those guys. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1813.0s)]
*  Because I remember them just talking shit about like, just random things. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1816.0s)]
*  Just regular dudes. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1820.0s)]
*  Yeah. Sometimes they're curious about things and they don't have the knowledge of like, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1821.0s)]
*  the celebrity world or like, the outside, this or that. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1824.0s)]
*  They're just kind of shooting the shit. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1827.0s)]
*  Sometimes I do kind of miss those convos. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1829.0s)]
*  But I don't know. I don't like them getting mad at jokes. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1831.0s)]
*  Yeah. I know what you're saying. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1836.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I got a lot of friends that have regular jobs. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1838.0s)]
*  One of my best friends works as a maintenance guy at a high school. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1842.0s)]
*  I've known him since I was like 24, 23. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1846.0s)]
*  Do you ever imagine like... [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1850.0s)]
*  Shout out to Tommy Jr. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1852.0s)]
*  Yo, what up, Tommy Jr. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1854.0s)]
*  Do you ever imagine like, going back to something like that? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1856.0s)]
*  To like regular life? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1862.0s)]
*  Yeah. Do you ever... [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1864.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1865.0s)]
*  Well, I think everybody that gets real famous, there's a certain amount of pressure that comes with that. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1866.0s)]
*  That's not comfortable for some people. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1871.0s)]
*  You know, like you think how it is like reading your comments. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1873.0s)]
*  Imagine if I read my comments. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1876.0s)]
*  I was going to ask you about that too. Do you ever read them? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1878.0s)]
*  No. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1880.0s)]
*  No. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1881.0s)]
*  They're not good for you. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1882.0s)]
*  They're not? No. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1883.0s)]
*  I think the bad ones are not good for you and the good ones aren't good for you either. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1884.0s)]
*  No. They can't be. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1887.0s)]
*  Because you got to stay you no matter what. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1888.0s)]
*  And that's difficult since a lot of guys lose their mind. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1891.0s)]
*  And I've lost my mind a few times and got it back. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1895.0s)]
*  But you can lose your mind. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1897.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1899.0s)]
*  You're lost in, you know, other people's opinions of you. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1900.0s)]
*  Who are you really? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1904.0s)]
*  You're not... [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1905.0s)]
*  You need at least some amount of time in your day to self-reflect. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1906.0s)]
*  Just self-reflect. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1912.0s)]
*  You know if you have asked something or if you did a good job. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1914.0s)]
*  You know if you're prepared for something the way you should have. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1918.0s)]
*  You know, you know, you know if a show went well. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1921.0s)]
*  You know if a show sucked. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1924.0s)]
*  You know you were off. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1926.0s)]
*  You like you didn't have... [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1927.0s)]
*  And it was something. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1928.0s)]
*  Anything. Whatever it is. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1929.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1930.0s)]
*  And if you don't spend enough time thinking about that and working on those things. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1931.0s)]
*  Whether it's with your personal life or your stand up or your hobbies or anything that you're doing. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1935.0s)]
*  If you don't have at least some time where you're not thinking about other people's opinions. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1940.0s)]
*  But you're just looking at it yourself. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1944.0s)]
*  Then you got too much noise coming in. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1946.0s)]
*  And too much noise. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1949.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck you. I didn't say fuck you. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1950.0s)]
*  And then you see people where their whole life is engaged in these meaningless disputes with people. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1952.0s)]
*  Meaningless. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1958.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1959.0s)]
*  Energy that you could spend on positive things. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1960.0s)]
*  Like friendships. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1963.0s)]
*  Like a hobby that you enjoy. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1965.0s)]
*  Like your loved ones. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1967.0s)]
*  Like positive things about life. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1969.0s)]
*  And I think for some people they get trapped in this world of other people's opinions. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1972.0s)]
*  And they don't take enough time to look at themselves. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1977.0s)]
*  Like think about yourself. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1979.0s)]
*  Think about you. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1980.0s)]
*  Think about what you're doing. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1981.0s)]
*  I'm learning. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1982.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm learning that. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1983.0s)]
*  At least for me. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1984.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1985.0s)]
*  I feel like stand up is a lot like a fight or like racing a car. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1986.0s)]
*  Like everybody can have an opinion on like why you won it. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1989.0s)]
*  Why you lost it. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1992.0s)]
*  The racer. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1993.0s)]
*  But nobody's really in the car with you. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1994.0s)]
*  Nobody saw if you actually shifted wrong or correctly. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1996.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=1999.0s)]
*  Or if it was because you ducked when you should have punched or something like. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2000.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2003.0s)]
*  Only you know. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2004.0s)]
*  Only you know. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2005.0s)]
*  Yeah. Learning that. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2006.0s)]
*  Yeah. But that's I guess that's the case with everything. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2007.0s)]
*  And there's nothing wrong with people expressing opinions. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2009.0s)]
*  But I just don't think it's good for you to get engaged with them. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2012.0s)]
*  I just don't think that's mentally healthy. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2015.0s)]
*  Oh I've engaged. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2018.0s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2019.0s)]
*  I engaged for like a good two hours. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2020.0s)]
*  But here's what I fucked up. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2023.0s)]
*  Not only engaging is I waited to post a clip. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2025.0s)]
*  And I had a feeling that a few people would talk some shit. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2028.0s)]
*  So I waited to post it on an afternoon where I'd have some time to engage. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2031.0s)]
*  Like I knew I would engage. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2035.0s)]
*  You did it on purpose? You were ready? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2036.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2037.0s)]
*  I was like nah because I want to see what people say. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2038.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2040.0s)]
*  But after a while I was like all right I've engaged enough. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2041.0s)]
*  But yeah after that I was like no I'm not doing this again. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2043.0s)]
*  That was kind of my like all right I'm good on engaging point. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2047.0s)]
*  That was when I realized like I should not check social media anymore. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2052.0s)]
*  Or not as often. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2056.0s)]
*  I posted a clip making fun of Latino Republicans. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2057.0s)]
*  I didn't even like say anything harsh. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2060.0s)]
*  They got mad. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2066.0s)]
*  All I said is they look weird. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2067.0s)]
*  That's like the heaviest thing I said. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2069.0s)]
*  Was that it's weird to see a dude with an accent be like we got to stop immigrants. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2072.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2076.0s)]
*  Because you're like wondering when they got here. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2077.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2079.0s)]
*  I was like I don't know if you're saying they're wrong. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2080.0s)]
*  I mean fucking Robit doesn't taste weird but I mean you need it right? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2082.0s)]
*  Like maybe it's working I don't know. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2085.0s)]
*  So I'm not saying they're wrong. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2087.0s)]
*  I just said it a little weird. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2088.0s)]
*  Well there's a shit load of them in Florida. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2089.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2092.0s)]
*  All the people that came from communist countries. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2093.0s)]
*  Oh here in Texas too. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2095.0s)]
*  Fuck that nonsense. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2096.0s)]
*  So a lot of the people who came from. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2097.0s)]
*  You want one of these little cigars? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2098.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2099.0s)]

*  Ron White got me on these little cigars. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2101.0s)]
*  Little baby cigars so you don't have to finish a whole one. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2103.0s)]
*  A lot of the people who were commenting were like people who came from communist countries. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2105.0s)]
*  And I don't know their experience. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2109.0s)]
*  I don't know the experience of anybody really. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2111.0s)]
*  I'm just up there talking some shit. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2113.0s)]

*  And people were in the comments. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2120.0s)]
*  They were like well Ralph doesn't understand politics. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2121.0s)]
*  Yeah I don't. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2125.0s)]

*  And he's out here too now. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2212.0s)]

*  And there's all these young guys coming up. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2221.0s)]
*  Because like a big point of the club was development. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2224.0s)]
*  Like we want to have two nights of open mic night. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2227.0s)]
*  Every Sunday, every Monday open mic night. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2229.0s)]
*  And then Monday kill Tony. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2231.0s)]
*  Kill Tony is the anchor. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2233.0s)]
*  That's the anchor. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2235.0s)]
*  That's the anchor because it sets the tone of the culture. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2236.0s)]
*  Like you have one minute. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2240.0s)]
*  In that minute you got to be funny. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2241.0s)]
*  You just got to be. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2243.0s)]
*  And then people realize like oh that's what this is all about. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2244.0s)]
*  Yeah this is an art form. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2247.0s)]
*  It's an art form. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2248.0s)]
*  And it's about how to be funny. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2249.0s)]
*  And everybody's got their own way. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2251.0s)]
*  You know Ali Siddique has these great stories. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2252.0s)]
*  He's got these beautiful long stories. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2255.0s)]
*  He's an amazing storyteller. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2258.0s)]
*  You know and then you got Joey Diaz who's like bang bang bang. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2259.0s)]
*  Bang bang bang. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2262.0s)]
*  He hits you with those bang bang bangs. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2263.0s)]
*  I love the upstairs room, the little boy, because you got comics going up. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2265.0s)]
*  But you also have like every employee in the mothership going up. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2270.0s)]
*  Yeah well they're all comics. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2274.0s)]
*  Yeah they're all comics too. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2275.0s)]
*  But you're giving them a chance man. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2276.0s)]
*  A lot of comics work the club to try to like get in with the club. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2278.0s)]
*  Like across the country. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2282.0s)]
*  Whatever their club is. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2284.0s)]
*  And sometimes even they don't get really the chance. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2285.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2287.0s)]
*  Yeah well we all came from open mics. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2288.0s)]
*  Everybody did. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2292.0s)]
*  Like that's the only way to do it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2294.0s)]
*  You have to get on stage. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2296.0s)]
*  So why would a club not have an open mic? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2297.0s)]
*  And they're like well it doesn't, you know we could fill it up with a headliner. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2300.0s)]
*  Yeah you could. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2303.0s)]
*  You could but you're making a short term gain decision where you're making more money. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2304.0s)]
*  And you're not looking at the long term just for the art form. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2311.0s)]
*  The art form needs seeds. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2318.0s)]
*  It needs plants. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2320.0s)]
*  It needs someone to help. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2321.0s)]
*  It needs someone to tend the garden. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2322.0s)]
*  It needs someone to give people opportunities. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2324.0s)]
*  And to say like this is a renewable resource. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2326.0s)]
*  This beautiful thing that we all enjoy. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2329.0s)]
*  People talking shit and us laughing. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2331.0s)]
*  It's the most beautiful thing. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2334.0s)]
*  I love it to death. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2336.0s)]
*  There's the art side and the business side. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2337.0s)]
*  Yeah well that's. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2339.0s)]
*  There's got to be a balance to it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2340.0s)]
*  That's where you, yeah you got to, you got to, I don't know man. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2341.0s)]
*  I, no one else, I don't know anybody else. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2346.0s)]
*  I don't know anybody else who did it this way because we had to do it in a way where you know we all got up and moved. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2350.0s)]
*  Right so it was crazy in the first place. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2357.0s)]
*  And we all took this chance to come here. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2360.0s)]
*  And in the beginning a lot of guys moved long before there was a club. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2362.0s)]
*  So we were just doing the Vulcan. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2365.0s)]
*  And they had heard that oh they got these wild ass shows they're doing in Texas indoors. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2367.0s)]
*  In November of 2020 we were doing shows indoors. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2372.0s)]
*  And it just started coming. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2375.0s)]
*  And then one day we did a show with Ron White and Ron White grabbed my shoulders. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2378.0s)]
*  He got off, so he hadn't done stand up in like eight months. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2383.0s)]
*  He grabs my shoulder. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2386.0s)]
*  Whatever the fuck we have to do, we're doing this. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2387.0s)]
*  He goes, when are you going to get your fucking club open up? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2391.0s)]
*  I go let's fucking go Ron White. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2395.0s)]
*  Let's do this shit. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2396.0s)]
*  He's like let's fucking go. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2397.0s)]
*  I mean he had just gotten off stage. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2399.0s)]
*  And then he gave you these cigars? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2401.0s)]
*  Yeah he loves these little cigars. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2403.0s)]
*  I like these. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2404.0s)]
*  They're good if you want a whole cigar. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2405.0s)]
*  I never smoked a cigar until I hung out with Bert Kreischer. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2407.0s)]
*  You want a big one? You want a real cigar? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2409.0s)]
*  Yeah I'll just take a big cigar. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2411.0s)]
*  Hold on please. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2412.0s)]
*  Hold. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2413.0s)]
*  Get you some of these foundation cigars. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2421.0s)]
*  We got our own cigar bro. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2424.0s)]
*  You make those cigars? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2425.0s)]
*  No foundation cigars do. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2427.0s)]
*  Oh I've never heard of that company. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2429.0s)]
*  I'm new to the cigar world. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2431.0s)]
*  I just got into it like in the summer. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2432.0s)]
*  Shout out to my man Nick. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2434.0s)]
*  Yeah this dude, I was super skeptical. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2436.0s)]
*  He goes we made you some cigars. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2439.0s)]
*  I'm like come on man. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2442.0s)]
*  These are probably going to be wack cigars with a label on it. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2443.0s)]
*  But no this dude is like a real cigar head. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2446.0s)]
*  He travels to the places where they grow it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2449.0s)]
*  He's involved in the whole process of it. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2453.0s)]
*  He makes a bunch of like really dope cigars. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2456.0s)]
*  Like Willy Wonka when he traveled to the jungle to find Oompa Loompas and stuff? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2459.0s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2463.0s)]
*  But anytime I hear like, you know how to work these? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2464.0s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2468.0s)]

*  And he's got this laboratory where he's like testing different weights of how much coffee you put in. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2495.0s)]
*  Different temperatures. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2504.0s)]
*  And they've got these dudes sitting around sipping them. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2506.0s)]
*  Trying to figure out what's the perfect way to do this shit. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2508.0s)]
*  Like they're doing it like a lab. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2511.0s)]

*  I should scare the shit out of me. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2584.0s)]
*  If I would have heard the guy laugh after he's like can I tell you about this. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2585.0s)]
*  And I'm like yeah. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2590.0s)]
*  And then he laughs. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2591.0s)]
*  I'll be like never mind bro. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2592.0s)]
*  I feel like he laughs. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2593.0s)]
*  What are you going to tell me? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2595.0s)]
*  Are you going to say a magic spell? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2596.0s)]
*  What are you going to say? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2598.0s)]
*  He was talking about a I don't remember all of it. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2599.0s)]
*  I just remember he was talking about like that Christianity used to be kind of like a cult. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2602.0s)]
*  And then he was saying something about they went underground with it to watch it or something. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2606.0s)]
*  Who was that Jamie? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2609.0s)]
*  You know who that is? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2610.0s)]
*  I was thinking you were talking about Brian Murray. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2612.0s)]
*  Brian Murray probably. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2614.0s)]
*  It could have been somebody else. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2615.0s)]
*  It might have been Brian. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2616.0s)]
*  Brian's amazing. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2617.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2618.0s)]
*  I mean it was a cool episode. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2619.0s)]
*  I've not learned a lot of shit about Christianity that I later forgot. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2621.0s)]
*  But it was just that one. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2624.0s)]
*  The one way he asked the question that scared the shit out of me. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2627.0s)]
*  And I was watching the clip like at 1 a.m. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2630.0s)]
*  Just chilling you know. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2632.0s)]
*  So I turned that off and I just turned the lights on in my room. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2633.0s)]
*  I was like all right. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2636.0s)]
*  Freaked me out a little bit. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2637.0s)]
*  What's interesting about Christianity everybody wants to know what was the first shit they wrote down. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2638.0s)]
*  Like everybody knows like the New Testament right. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2644.0s)]
*  The New Testament. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2647.0s)]
*  But then you go what about the Old Testament. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2648.0s)]
*  Like don't pay attention to that. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2650.0s)]
*  Yeah I don't really like that. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2653.0s)]
*  I don't really like that. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2654.0s)]
*  That they be changing shit. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2655.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2656.0s)]
*  Give me one set of rules. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2657.0s)]
*  Leave it. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2658.0s)]
*  Now if you choose to follow them or not that's on you. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2659.0s)]
*  But don't change shit. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2660.0s)]
*  Even if it is the writings of Jesus. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2661.0s)]
*  Even if it is the writings of. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2663.0s)]
*  Even if all that is unadulterated. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2664.0s)]
*  It's not been altered by human beings. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2666.0s)]
*  It's still put together by people written down by people. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2669.0s)]
*  You ever do that thing. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2675.0s)]
*  And very different than the Old Testament. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2676.0s)]
*  They are. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2678.0s)]
*  I remember they did this like at Barbara College once. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2679.0s)]
*  Just to like teach us a lesson or some shit. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2681.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2683.0s)]
*  But they had this long bench. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2684.0s)]
*  They sat down all the students. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2687.0s)]
*  And our instructor whispered a secret to the first person on the far right. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2689.0s)]
*  Telephone game. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2694.0s)]
*  Yeah you got to just keep whispering the secret down the line. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2695.0s)]
*  And by the end of the line it's a totally different sentence. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2698.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2700.0s)]
*  That shit made me never want to like check out the Bible anymore. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2701.0s)]
*  Yeah the Bible was they think they. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2705.0s)]
*  It was an oral tradition for hundreds if not a thousand years before they ever wrote it down. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2708.0s)]
*  God damn. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2715.0s)]
*  That's a lot of mix up. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2716.0s)]
*  Could be. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2719.0s)]
*  Yeah for sure people could have added some shit in there. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2720.0s)]
*  You religious at all? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2722.0s)]
*  Like you go to church or anything? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2723.0s)]
*  You follow a religion? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2724.0s)]
*  I'm not religious but I'm not an atheist. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2725.0s)]
*  People always say I'm an atheist. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2727.0s)]
*  I'm not an atheist. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2728.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm on something like that. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2729.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2731.0s)]
*  There's something going on out there. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2732.0s)]
*  I mean I grew up like somewhat Catholic. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2735.0s)]
*  Like how most Mexican Catholics are. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2738.0s)]
*  Like maybe you don't go to church but you do this thing all the time. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2740.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2742.0s)]
*  So like I'm still like you know like but yeah there is. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2743.0s)]
*  I don't know man. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2747.0s)]
*  I don't know what to believe. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2748.0s)]
*  I do want to have a religion. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2749.0s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2750.0s)]
*  It would be nice if there was a good one. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2751.0s)]
*  One you could like really lock into. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2753.0s)]
*  Like man you guys are making sense. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2755.0s)]
*  Well I just like that people really like lock into something and I don't know man. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2756.0s)]
*  I want to I want to like defend something. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2761.0s)]
*  I want to be like you don't speak that way about Allah. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2764.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2767.0s)]
*  It's a nice gang to be a part of. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2768.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2769.0s)]
*  Very aggressive gang. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2770.0s)]
*  But I also feel like the gang I belong to whether I like it or not is like the comedy [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2771.0s)]
*  world. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2776.0s)]
*  Just make fun of everything. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2777.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2778.0s)]
*  That's our gang. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2779.0s)]
*  But I think religion helps a lot of people and I don't necessarily think it's. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2780.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2785.0s)]
*  I think it came from somewhere and I think there's there's like real wisdom to these [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2786.0s)]
*  stories that people wrote down thousands of years ago. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2791.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of problems in the translations too because they're translating shit from [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2794.0s)]
*  like the here's a good example. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2801.0s)]
*  The Dead Sea Scrolls is the oldest version of the Bible that they're aware of and it's [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2803.0s)]
*  from Qumran. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2809.0s)]
*  These it's this they have these like these caves and they found these big pottery vessels [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2810.0s)]
*  with scrolls in them. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2818.0s)]
*  And these scrolls they're all made of animal skins. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2820.0s)]
*  That's how old they are. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2825.0s)]
*  That was their paper. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2826.0s)]
*  They wrote on animal skins. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2827.0s)]
*  And one of the ways that they figured out they had to put it all together again and [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2829.0s)]
*  a lot of it was crumpled and falling apart. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2833.0s)]
*  And so they had to do DNA testing so that they could figure out OK this sample these [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2835.0s)]
*  samples are all from this cow. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2841.0s)]
*  And so we'll put these here. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2843.0s)]
*  And it took them fucking years and years and years to do this. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2845.0s)]
*  And after 14 years of deciphering it there was this one guy's name is John Marco Allegro [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2849.0s)]
*  and he was he was an ordained minister but he was also agnostic because when he studied [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2856.0s)]
*  theology the more he started studying it the more he's like what the fuck is how come this [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2863.0s)]
*  is so much different than this and what's the origins of these words where this all [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2868.0s)]
*  come from. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2871.0s)]
*  So this guy studies this Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 years and then he writes a book called [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2872.0s)]
*  The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2877.0s)]
*  And he said that the whole Christian religion was really about psychedelic mushrooms and [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2879.0s)]
*  fertility rituals that these people had hidden all of these stories in these allegories and [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2885.0s)]
*  in these tales they'd hidden all this information on what to do and when to do it. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2893.0s)]
*  And that all it's a very very controversial book but that all of the like even [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2899.0s)]
*  Do you think they got it at Barnes and Nobles? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2905.0s)]
*  I think you probably get it now. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2907.0s)]
*  I know it got yeah it got republished. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2909.0s)]
*  It was I think it was bought out by the Catholic Church for a long time. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2911.0s)]
*  And then I didn't know the Catholic Church was buying out books. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2914.0s)]
*  They didn't want this one out. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2917.0s)]
*  Some Wolf of Wall Street shit. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2919.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2920.0s)]
*  I need to find out if that's true because I've said it before because someone told it to me. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2921.0s)]
*  Dude you say it with enough confidence it's true. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2924.0s)]
*  Yeah if you say it with enough confidence you can get but people will. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2926.0s)]
*  The Catholic Church bought out GameStop a couple years ago. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2928.0s)]
*  They're responsible for Battlefield Earth. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2932.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2934.0s)]
*  Man that's crazy that they were writing on like cow skin. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2935.0s)]
*  Yeah that's all they had. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2937.0s)]
*  Fucking cows man. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2939.0s)]
*  Cows have never had it easy on this earth. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2940.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2942.0s)]
*  Even when they have a good life it's only for Kobe beef you know what I mean? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2943.0s)]
*  Right even if they have a good life it's only like 16 years old. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2946.0s)]
*  What is it like in Japan where they really like massage them? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2949.0s)]
*  Imagine being that cow just being like [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2953.0s)]
*  damn I've heard about cows that get slaughtered but man I got lucky to be born in this life [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2955.0s)]
*  and they're like nope. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2959.0s)]
*  You got slightly luckier than the other cows but still a cow. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2960.0s)]
*  The thing about cows is if you care about like suffering. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2964.0s)]
*  If you can buy beef from a regenerative farm where that cow dies instantly. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2969.0s)]
*  Lives a great life until it dies. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2975.0s)]
*  And then you'd say like no we should let them free they should be free. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2977.0s)]
*  The way they die when they're free is horrific. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2980.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2983.0s)]
*  Horrific yeah because they get eaten to death. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2984.0s)]
*  Oh yeah right. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2987.0s)]
*  They get eaten. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2988.0s)]
*  Most of them are not going to make it past being a calf. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2989.0s)]
*  Mountain lions, bears, wolves. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2992.0s)]
*  They bring wolves back. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2995.0s)]
*  They've brought wolves back everywhere now. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2997.0s)]
*  Wolves are in Colorado now. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=2999.0s)]
*  They're back now. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3001.0s)]
*  Yeah they're moving them in. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3002.0s)]
*  Fat ass. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3003.0s)]
*  The wolves are back in town. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3004.0s)]
*  The wolves are back in town. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3006.0s)]
*  I think that's the boys. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3008.0s)]
*  Oh yeah yeah yeah. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3009.0s)]
*  Well you know what they man. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3010.0s)]
*  The wolves are back in town. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3011.0s)]
*  They're going to eat your dog. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3012.0s)]
*  They're going to kill your kids. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3013.0s)]
*  Oh shit I didn't think about that. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3014.0s)]
*  It's the little red riding hood shit man. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3016.0s)]
*  That's all the big bad wolf. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3018.0s)]
*  That's because in Europe in like the 1400s or whatever the fuck. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3019.0s)]
*  They're eating people's grandmas and shit. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3022.0s)]
*  They ate everybody. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3024.0s)]
*  Wolves ate people. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3025.0s)]
*  Wait what year was this? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3027.0s)]
*  Listen wolves always eat people. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3030.0s)]
*  In World War I there was a ceasefire between the Germans and the Russians. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3033.0s)]
*  Because wolves are eating so many soldiers that they decided to band together and kill the wolves. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3037.0s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3042.0s)]
*  So you know maybe that's not a problem. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3043.0s)]
*  The world is a very split right now. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3045.0s)]
*  Maybe wolves are going to bring us back together. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3047.0s)]
*  Maybe man. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3050.0s)]
*  Also maybe we need to bring back psychedelic Christianity. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3051.0s)]
*  Maybe that's what red riding hood was on. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3054.0s)]
*  That's why she thought the wolf was her grandma and shit. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3057.0s)]
*  Probably tripping. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3059.0s)]
*  Bitch was tripping. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3060.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3061.0s)]
*  Imagine how high you have to be. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3062.0s)]
*  Like a wolf with a dress as your grandma. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3063.0s)]
*  I'll tell you this though on the whole Christian psychedelic trip shit. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3065.0s)]
*  One time I ate like 9-10 grams of shrooms. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3071.0s)]
*  And I swear to God the ceiling there was a face in it. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3073.0s)]
*  And for some reason in my mind I was like that's God. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3077.0s)]
*  And he was fucking pissed. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3080.0s)]
*  He was pissed? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3081.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3082.0s)]
*  At you? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3083.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3084.0s)]
*  For what? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3085.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3086.0s)]
*  I think it's just because on the inside I'm always. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3087.0s)]
*  I've never done mushrooms out during the day. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3088.0s)]
*  I know some people are like yeah man do mushrooms. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3092.0s)]
*  Go to a park. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3094.0s)]
*  Nah. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3095.0s)]
*  I do believe there's like God out there. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3096.0s)]
*  Some sort of God. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3098.0s)]
*  And I don't think he's necessarily like the good guy on a TV show. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3099.0s)]
*  I think he's God. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3105.0s)]
*  You ever had like a boss? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3106.0s)]
*  Like at a place? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3108.0s)]
*  And maybe he's not exactly fair. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3110.0s)]
*  Maybe he's not exactly nice. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3112.0s)]
*  But he's the fucking boss. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3114.0s)]
*  And when he says go. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3115.0s)]
*  I feel like maybe that's what God is. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3116.0s)]
*  For better or worse. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3118.0s)]
*  And I feel like if I do mushrooms out in the open he's going to be like mad. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3119.0s)]
*  So I do them at night. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3123.0s)]
*  I usually do them in my hotel rooms. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3124.0s)]
*  I do research on hotels that have like artwork and stuff. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3125.0s)]
*  Like Hotel Indigo is a great place to trip. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3128.0s)]
*  Especially the one in Houston. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3131.0s)]
*  If I go to Houston I'm staying at the Hotel Indigo. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3132.0s)]
*  But yeah the ceiling man. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3135.0s)]
*  I was tripping so hard. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3137.0s)]
*  And the face came out. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3139.0s)]
*  And it looked like a hand. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3141.0s)]
*  And then like an elbow. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3143.0s)]
*  And then I felt like he was putting his elbow on my neck. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3145.0s)]
*  And I couldn't breathe. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3147.0s)]
*  I started trying to breathe real hard. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3148.0s)]
*  And my buddy was like having a nice trip. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3150.0s)]
*  He was just like that's right man bro. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3153.0s)]
*  I was like no dumbass. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3154.0s)]
*  Like I can't breathe. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3155.0s)]
*  God's choking you. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3156.0s)]
*  Yeah God was like putting the pressure down on my neck. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3157.0s)]
*  But I felt like that was maybe in my mind. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3160.0s)]
*  Well it's definitely in your mind. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3162.0s)]
*  Yeah you know like just feeling pressure in general. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3163.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3166.0s)]
*  Wondering if I'm doing the right thing or not. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3167.0s)]
*  Yeah well a lot of changes have happened really quickly with you. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3168.0s)]
*  You know Brian Simpson was telling me that you were going to open for him one weekend. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3172.0s)]
*  In January of 2022 I think. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3177.0s)]
*  And then you blew up. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3178.0s)]
*  And then you blew up. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3180.0s)]
*  And then he called you. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3182.0s)]
*  And you're like bro I'm headlining all these clubs now. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3184.0s)]
*  Nah that story is. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3186.0s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3188.0s)]
*  The story is a little different. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3189.0s)]
*  He said you were doing great. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3190.0s)]
*  I mean yeah I do. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3192.0s)]
*  He said it was a period of a few months. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3193.0s)]
*  And he got a hold of you and you were headlining everywhere. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3195.0s)]
*  I can't man. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3198.0s)]
*  I shouldn't say how the story went because I'm not even sure how the story went. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3199.0s)]
*  Maybe that is how. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3202.0s)]
*  I do remember we spoke and I was just telling him like man I'm a. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3203.0s)]
*  Like I do want to open for you because. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3206.0s)]
*  He's fucking. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3208.0s)]
*  Brian Simpson that dude's hilarious. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3209.0s)]
*  Hilarious. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3210.0s)]
*  But at the same time I was like I kind of want to take my chances on some headlining. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3211.0s)]
*  Like headlining my own shows here. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3214.0s)]
*  But looking back on it. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3216.0s)]
*  I mean there's no regrets. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3218.0s)]
*  I feel like as long as I'm doing whatever I feel like doing in that moment there's no regrets you know. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3219.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3223.0s)]
*  But looking back on it I do wish. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3224.0s)]
*  Things would have gone maybe a little slower for me. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3228.0s)]
*  Just because I was still a feature. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3231.0s)]
*  I wasn't used to headlining shows when I started headlining shows. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3234.0s)]
*  And I feel like a lot of my shows were me still very much learning and getting comfortable with an hour on stage. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3237.0s)]

*  You know what I mean. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3940.6400000000003s)]
*  So armor all just being in the room will fuck up your paint. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3941.12s)]
*  Yeah bro if you like let's say let's say you like sprayed some armor on some shit or you [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3945.6s)]

*  But what is that doing to you then? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3967.6s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3969.7599999999998s)]
*  All the paint stuff. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3970.72s)]
*  Oh it's killing you. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3971.44s)]
*  Armor. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3972.32s)]
*  It's gotta be killing you. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3973.76s)]
*  I mean the paint is worse than the armor. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3974.8s)]
*  We're like breathing in like primer we're breathing in like Bondo dust. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3976.4s)]
*  We're breathing in so much stuff. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3979.76s)]
*  Is there a lot of people that have like lung problems that are painters? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3981.04s)]
*  Oh yeah yeah yeah. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3984.32s)]
*  Even if you even if you don't like get the lung cancer right. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3985.84s)]
*  Let's say you live a full life as a painter. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3988.4s)]
*  They've done autopsies on painters. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3990.88s)]
*  Their lungs are like different colors. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3992.48s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ really. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3994.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah but I mean I'd rather have different colors than just you know nasty pink or whatever. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3996.0s)]
*  What if you wear one of those Fauci masks? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=3999.92s)]
*  They help no like definitely wear your mask wear your gloves they help. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4001.92s)]
*  But the shit is there you know what I mean. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4005.92s)]
*  You're getting it in even through those crazy masks? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4007.44s)]
*  Yeah for sure you know there's no way. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4009.6s)]
*  And then there's different masks. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4011.28s)]
*  There's masks that will help you block the dust from like primer or like from the body filler. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4012.48s)]
*  But those masks aren't going to help you when it comes to paint and like vice versa. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4020.32s)]
*  Oh so you gotta swap masks when you're sanding versus when you're painting. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4023.76s)]
*  Yeah so I started getting pretty good as a painter. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4028.4s)]
*  Especially when I went to work at a shop where my uncle's not like babysitting me anymore. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4032.4s)]
*  Now I'm like learning on my own. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4035.84s)]
*  And when I say on my own I mean like the reason I say that one painter wasn't worth the damn [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4037.1200000000003s)]
*  was because when you first work at a shop and you're trying to be a painter you gotta [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4041.76s)]
*  be like a paint prepper or like a painter's apprentice for like a few years. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4046.32s)]
*  So it's my job to like prepare the car like every step of the way up until it's in the booth. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4050.96s)]
*  Taped up ready to get painted. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4057.36s)]
*  That's when the painter would just show up. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4059.52s)]
*  I don't know he's probably just been kicking it at the house all day. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4061.44s)]
*  He'll show up, mix the paint, paint it, spray it, clear it and then he'd go home. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4064.08s)]
*  So I've been prepping these cars for like days on end. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4069.84s)]
*  I'm staying extra you know. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4072.2400000000002s)]
*  Every now and then if it was a smaller piece like a bumper or just like a like a small piece of the [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4073.76s)]
*  car they just leave it up to me. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4079.12s)]
*  They're like well you go ahead and knock it out. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4080.4s)]
*  So I started getting good. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4081.76s)]
*  There was a guy there. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4083.36s)]
*  Man I forget his name. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4084.56s)]
*  Super cool ass fucking guy who was just kind of like a shop hand like he didn't really work on [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4085.52s)]
*  cars but if you needed help you know sometimes you need help moving a fucking hood or a door like [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4092.48s)]
*  just random shit. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4098.0s)]
*  He was there and he had a Buick like it was his grandpa's Buick like a 99 just regular Buick. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4098.96s)]
*  He was like man I want you to paint it. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4106.0s)]
*  I want you to paint it. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4107.2s)]
*  So I painted like half the car because only the front end needed it. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4108.08s)]
*  That was like my only like big paint job. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4112.32s)]
*  I started getting good but that's when I really jumped more into comedy. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4116.88s)]
*  So I just kind of quit and I did whatever I had to do to make sure comedy worked out [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4121.04s)]
*  and I went back to like cutting hair because it allowed me more time to jump to open mics quicker. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4124.719999999999s)]
*  You know. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4128.96s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4172.639999999999s)]

*  And just me and three four people in the room that aren't even audience just other open micers. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4214.48s)]
*  And leaving walking through the parking lot I'm like this isn't for me. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4219.92s)]
*  This isn't for me. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4223.92s)]
*  I just stick to my job like okay you know. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4224.639999999999s)]
*  But the next day when I'm fucking sanding a car for three hours straight the whole time in my head [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4227.36s)]
*  I'm just like thinking of what if I would have said it different or if I would have said this instead. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4232.0s)]
*  Well what if I tried this on stage like my mind was always there. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4235.92s)]
*  So I just so I'd go back but then I'd get discouraged again. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4240.0s)]
*  Older dudes would scare me. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4242.879999999999s)]
*  I'm a very introverted person. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4244.0s)]
*  I've been breaking out of my shell more and more you know you kind of have to in the comedy world [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4246.719999999999s)]
*  but I was so introverted. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4250.16s)]
*  Sometimes I'll tell people that no you're not and it's like all right I'm not whatever but I am. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4251.5199999999995s)]
*  Like to talk to people would feel like a tremendous fucking stress and fear like I freak out. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4256.16s)]
*  Even till this day if I'm walking through the mall and somebody who might be a fan or something is [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4260.56s)]
*  walking up to me and I see them walking and the whole time in my head I was like oh shit oh shit. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4264.48s)]
*  And then they're like what's up man big fan. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4268.96s)]
*  I'm like oh okay all right hey what's up bro thanks man. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4270.4s)]
*  But as soon as it's over I'm like fucking thank God like. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4273.2s)]
*  But yeah man so I don't know. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4277.84s)]
*  So that's why I never really stuck to painting. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4280.08s)]
*  Because comedy took over. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4282.0s)]
*  When did you start pursuing it full time? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4283.599999999999s)]
*  How many years in were you? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4286.48s)]
*  So when I'm like 19, 18 I'm doing it once every few months. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4289.68s)]
*  But once I was 20 I just every night didn't stop going you know what I mean like just [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4294.96s)]
*  fuck it like full blast. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4302.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4303.36s)]
*  Because I think that's when I finally got like a laugh. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4304.08s)]
*  Do you remember the joke? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4307.44s)]
*  Yeah it wasn't even a joke it was like just a reaction to a dude in the crowd man. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4309.360000000001s)]
*  And that was like my first hard lesson in comedy. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4313.52s)]
*  I went up at a place called Backdoor Comedy where you have to be clean. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4316.08s)]
*  Which shout out to them I feel like that's the place that really made me love comedy. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4319.76s)]
*  Because you can't even talk about like the restroom. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4323.84s)]
*  So I felt like that forced me to really write you know what I mean. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4326.72s)]
*  Get creative. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4329.68s)]
*  Right right right so taking the easier way out. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4330.72s)]
*  Yeah and I wouldn't say I'm necessarily a clean comic now. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4333.6s)]
*  I feel like there's no set style I want to have. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4336.24s)]
*  Like if there's a joke that's dirty or cuss words fuck it you know what I mean. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4339.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4342.639999999999s)]
*  It's funny it's funny. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4342.96s)]
*  But that room I was so nervous I was like I gotta be clean. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4343.84s)]
*  And it took place the mic the show the little tiny it's not even a club it's just a room [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4348.0s)]
*  that used to be located inside the Hilton Double Tree. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4353.28s)]
*  And the audience that would show for that they'd get a real audience for the mic. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4357.36s)]
*  But it was kind of like classier uppity folk a lot of white people with money. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4360.48s)]
*  Which intimidated the fuck out of me. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4364.24s)]
*  I was never used to leaving my own little circle. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4365.76s)]
*  And as I was walking up to the stage there was this dude. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4368.4800000000005s)]
*  This is like older white guy in a button down his arms crossed. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4370.8s)]
*  And that guy just scared the shit out of me. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4374.8s)]
*  He there was I had a neighbor who every time I walked by his house if he happened to see me. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4376.96s)]
*  Or just kids he'd stare really hard. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4381.92s)]
*  Like I'm pretty sure he's a little racist you know. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4384.88s)]
*  He'd just stare like making sure we didn't take nothing from his yard. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4386.8s)]
*  He just stared he didn't care if you saw him. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4389.6s)]
*  He had a glass door. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4391.2s)]
*  He would stand behind the glass door just like. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4392.56s)]
*  Fucking staring hard. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4394.959999999999s)]
*  And he looked like that guy to me. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4396.16s)]
*  So as I walked up I just looked at that guy. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4398.0s)]
*  I didn't think about my jokes. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4400.879999999999s)]
*  I didn't think about nothing. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4401.759999999999s)]
*  I was like man this dude looks like he caught the cops on me already. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4402.719999999999s)]
*  And the audience laughed. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4405.679999999999s)]
*  And the first lesson was like just fucking you know. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4406.719999999999s)]
*  Say what you're going to say. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4409.599999999999s)]
*  Be vulnerable. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4410.959999999999s)]
*  Be honest. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4411.759999999999s)]
*  And that was like my first little lesson like it worked. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4412.719999999999s)]
*  So then you started feeling it. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4416.0s)]
*  Yeah after I got that laugh it wasn't even like a huge laugh or they're going to clap. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4417.759999999999s)]
*  But it was a laugh. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4422.08s)]
*  Something. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4422.719999999999s)]
*  But you know that first time you get a laugh it feels like you just destroyed the room. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4423.28s)]
*  After that I'd get a little better. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4428.32s)]
*  I was able to deliver for a minute. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4429.679999999999s)]
*  And then I was able to deliver for two. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4431.599999999999s)]
*  And they'd give you three minutes at that mic. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4433.28s)]
*  So then two minutes would go good and then three. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4436.0s)]
*  And then I'd have like a killer three. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4437.92s)]
*  Linda Stagner the owner of that place started letting me host the weekends with just three minutes. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4440.48s)]
*  But there's like it's like a showcase style room. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4445.44s)]
*  And there's tons of comics. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4447.84s)]
*  The show would go on for like two hours. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4449.04s)]
*  And there's just so many comics. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4451.04s)]
*  I'd take it. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4452.88s)]
*  I'd host for three minutes. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4454.639999999999s)]
*  And then the next fucking two hours just you know. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4455.759999999999s)]
*  I'd do my three minutes set and then the next two hours just host. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4459.5199999999995s)]
*  You know remember people's credits whatever. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4461.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4463.44s)]
*  But yeah I loved it man. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4464.16s)]
*  I also just love going to different clubs. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4465.759999999999s)]
*  I feel like Dallas was too small of a scene for people to click up. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4467.5199999999995s)]
*  But they did. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4470.5599999999995s)]
*  They'd be like nah that's a hyenas comic or that's a Dallas comedy club comic. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4471.84s)]
*  And there was yeah. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4475.28s)]
*  And then you know Dallas comedy club was maybe where you'd go. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4476.639999999999s)]
*  If you were a little more like on the woke side. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4480.24s)]
*  Not necessarily too woke. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4482.48s)]
*  But you know you were a little cleaner a little friendlier. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4483.5199999999995s)]
*  Hyenas was where you'd go if you just wanted to say some shit get a little more raunchy. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4485.759999999999s)]
*  Backdoor was definitely like where I feel like a lot of good fucking like comics would go on the weekend. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4489.679999999999s)]
*  Sometimes people would just pop in because they'd happen to have some extra time on the weekend. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4498.5599999999995s)]
*  But I'd like to go into all of them man. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4504.16s)]
*  Because all of them you had shit to learn. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4505.84s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4507.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4508.08s)]
*  It's good to get a variety. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4508.8s)]
*  It's so silly to think of yourself as I'm a this club comic. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4510.24s)]
*  Because we kind of used to do that with the comedy store. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4514.08s)]
*  But even then it's like you still did. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4517.4400000000005s)]
*  Even at the comedy store I've seen. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4519.2s)]
*  I mean I've never lived in LA but I've been in there tons of times just to watch and shit you know. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4520.72s)]
*  Even there you get a variety of comics who have different styles. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4525.92s)]
*  That's what I fucking love. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4529.04s)]
*  There's this Bruce Lee movie. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4530.16s)]
*  I remember the movie. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4532.24s)]
*  But I saved the video. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4533.52s)]
*  I have like screen recorded on my phone. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4534.64s)]
*  And sometimes I watch it on the plane. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4536.24s)]
*  Airplane mode. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4538.08s)]
*  I have a video where he's talking to like a grand master type dude. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4538.64s)]
*  And he's questioning Bruce Lee. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4543.52s)]
*  And that fucking that one quote I feel like just applies so much to not only comedy but everything. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4545.280000000001s)]
*  He asked Bruce Lee he's like what is the highest technique you hope to achieve. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4550.320000000001s)]
*  And Bruce Lee's like to have no technique. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4557.04s)]
*  I was like bro that's fucking it right there. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4559.84s)]
*  Like that's the thing you know what I mean. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4561.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4563.84s)]
*  Like I get it. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4564.64s)]
*  A clean comic is a clean comic. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4565.360000000001s)]
*  And they're funny with it right. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4566.8s)]
*  Some people only want clean comedy and a dirty comic is funny as fuck. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4567.76s)]
*  Some people only want that. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4570.88s)]
*  But to be able to do everything you know what I mean. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4571.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4574.16s)]
*  Like to not subject yourself to one style of comedy like that's fucking hilarious. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4574.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4579.76s)]
*  That's the beauty of having to do like a clean set for television. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4580.72s)]
*  Is that you do have to work on it. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4584.96s)]
*  And sometimes when you're working on stuff like that it's there's a good it's a good [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4587.28s)]
*  exercise in being locked into a rigid structure where you can't say you can't talk about blowjobs. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4591.84s)]
*  You can't talk about anything crazy. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4598.4800000000005s)]
*  You have like a FCC set of rules or whatever it is. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4601.28s)]
*  When you you do that it forces you to think of alternative ways for things to be funny [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4605.04s)]
*  other than going to like a cheap laugh. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4611.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4614.16s)]
*  You know sometimes cheap laughs are the funniest though. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4614.4800000000005s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4617.28s)]
*  Joey Diaz like he's got great punchlines but great timing. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4618.24s)]
*  But it's also he will he will go for it wherever it is. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4623.6s)]
*  He doesn't give a it's just like what is the funniest fucking thing to say right now. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4626.72s)]
*  I'm going for that. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4630.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4630.88s)]
*  Like there's no thought of like Joey would never do a clean TV set. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4631.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4635.44s)]
*  It would be hell. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4635.76s)]
*  Like you can't do that to Joey. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4637.12s)]
*  But Joey's got to be wild and like for him to be locked into a TV set that isn't that's not the way for him. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4638.88s)]
*  But also for him he's the funny I've never seen anybody funnier in my life. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4647.28s)]
*  In all the people I've seen murder all the Chappelle and Chris Rock and Shane Gillis and [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4651.919999999999s)]
*  all the murderers. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4659.12s)]
*  Joey Diaz in the original room at like 1130 p.m. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4661.2s)]
*  on a fucking Wednesday night or something like that has made me laugh harder than anybody. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4664.879999999999s)]
*  Anybody. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4669.28s)]

*  He was doing this bit about Terry Crews about that agent who grabbed Terry Crews's day. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4674.72s)]
*  Terry Crews was shaking his big dick and his underwear and those commercials that he did. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4680.56s)]
*  This guy was going crazy bro. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4685.92s)]
*  We were falling on the ground laughing. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4687.4400000000005s)]
*  We couldn't breathe. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4690.88s)]
*  He hits RPMs you know like a lot of people redline at like seven thousand eight thousand. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4692.96s)]
*  It's really funny. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4698.64s)]
*  It's great. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4699.360000000001s)]

*  And you're like holy shit man. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4702.0s)]

*  He came to the mothership. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4709.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4710.64s)]
*  He only did one show. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4711.280000000001s)]
*  I love people like that too that are funny as fuck on stage and off stage. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4713.04s)]
*  Well that was the thing about Joey is like when I brought him on the road. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4717.6s)]
*  I brought him on the road for two reasons. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4721.120000000001s)]
*  One because I love him and two because he's really funny and it challenges me. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4722.88s)]
*  Like I was going on after him. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4726.8s)]
*  But also he's funny all the time. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4728.64s)]
*  Like he's funny when you're at dinner. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4732.72s)]
*  He's funny in the green room. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4734.400000000001s)]
*  We're just it's a party. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4735.6s)]
*  Joey brings the party. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4737.200000000001s)]
*  So when we would all go on the road together it was just fun. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4738.72s)]
*  It was family together you know like Vin Diesel would say. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4741.68s)]
*  But it was like that. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4747.4400000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4934.5599999999995s)]
*  Hinchcliffe was first well Ron White was here before all of us. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4934.88s)]
*  Ron White had told me by he had already moved before the pandemic. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4938.16s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4941.04s)]
*  Because I fucking love Austin. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4941.5199999999995s)]
*  Austin's a shit he goes I can travel do all my gigs it's the middle of the country. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4943.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4947.92s)]
*  Like man I don't know if I could live in Austin that's what I was thinking back then like [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4948.08s)]
*  you know I'm in LA like my podcast is there the store is there Jujitsu is there. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4951.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I could leave yet. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4956.88s)]
*  Then the pandemic hit I was like what I got to get the fuck out of here and Ron was already [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4958.32s)]
*  here and so when we first came down you know Ron had told me like where to go what's the [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4963.76s)]
*  cool spots and I'd been here a few times before doing stand up over the years you know never [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4969.12s)]
*  really spent like a lot of time here. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4973.52s)]
*  But then when I decided to move I was telling everybody I was like fuck that place man like [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4976.16s)]
*  I'm thinking about opening a club. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4983.52s)]
*  And I first started I got this place that was run by a cult. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4985.92s)]
*  The first building I got was this building called the One World Theater and it's a theater. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4991.76s)]
*  That's such a cult ass name too. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4997.04s)]
*  Such a cult ass name but I think they named it that after the cult left. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=4998.8s)]
*  One of the guys that was in the cult actually still owned it. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5003.5199999999995s)]
*  So what had happened was this dude ran a cult in West Hollywood and he's this really beautiful [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5006.56s)]
*  handsome yoga guy and he was a hypnotist and a gay porn star. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5013.68s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5018.240000000001s)]
*  Oh shit yeah. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5019.04s)]
*  So this dude runs this cult West Hollywood and then Waco pops off and the cult awareness [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5020.08s)]
*  network is like they're like now investigating cults and there's a bunch of family members that [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5024.64s)]
*  have been complaining about this cult. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5029.76s)]
*  So this dude in the middle of the night fucking jets and takes off across the country and [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5031.360000000001s)]
*  moves to Austin and then has all the and changes his name and has all the cult members [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5036.16s)]
*  eventually come out here and he wants them to build a theater so that he can dance in [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5041.76s)]
*  front of them. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5045.76s)]
*  That's the place I bought. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5046.88s)]
*  And I bought it because Ron White said you should buy that place owned by the cult. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5050.16s)]
*  It's the shit. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5053.76s)]
*  I didn't stand up there once. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5054.56s)]
*  It's fucking beautiful. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5055.92s)]
*  So you know Ron White's the man so he tells me I should buy that place. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5057.68s)]
*  I'm like all right that'd probably be the perfect spot. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5060.64s)]
*  And so we were in the middle of this whole thing but it all fell apart. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5062.8s)]
*  There was some issues that had to be dealt with that weren't dealt with. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5066.0s)]
*  I don't even know if I'm allowed to talk about them so I won't. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5068.96s)]
*  But the point is that was the original spot and that fell apart and then it was like a [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5071.92s)]
*  long time to try to find another spot. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5076.4800000000005s)]
*  And then Ron White was like and then grabbing after I did that set with him at the Vulcan [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5079.280000000001s)]
*  he's like whatever the fuck we have to do we're doing this. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5084.08s)]
*  I was like okay let's go. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5087.4400000000005s)]
*  You ever wonder if like Ron White isn't really just a figment of your imagination. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5088.96s)]
*  He's your conscience. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5092.88s)]
*  No Ron White is that's a real dude. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5095.12s)]

*  Yeah man. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5100.64s)]
*  He's our like elder statesman of stand up. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5102.24s)]
*  You know everybody loves Ron White. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5104.48s)]
*  There's no Ron White haters out there. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5106.88s)]
*  Ron White is amazing. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5108.72s)]

*  He's there all the time. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5119.28s)]

*  I can't watch open mics bomb. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5172.96s)]
*  No? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5174.64s)]
*  I can't. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5174.88s)]
*  I gotta get out of the room. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5175.28s)]
*  I feel like it's contagious. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5176.4800000000005s)]
*  Like when I would go on the road and I'd have a terrible opening act. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5177.84s)]
*  It's always always in Florida. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5180.8s)]
*  They would throw people up. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5184.32s)]
*  They'd been doing stand up for five minutes. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5185.92s)]
*  I'd never done stand up before. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5187.76s)]
*  It's like these people were terrible. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5188.88s)]
*  So many of these clubs they were so bad. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5191.2s)]
*  And I would be in the green room and I'd peek my head out. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5193.92s)]
*  I'd watch this dude just eat shit. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5196.4s)]
*  I'm like oh my god I gotta get my own head. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5197.84s)]
*  I can't pay attention to that. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5199.6s)]
*  Because I would try to pay attention to make sure that they're not talking about stuff that I talk about. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5201.52s)]
*  You know I don't want to cover the same ground. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5205.84s)]
*  So I'd like listen to the opening act to try to figure out like oh he talked about that movie. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5208.08s)]
*  I can't talk about that movie. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5212.88s)]
*  Let me adjust my set. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5214.24s)]
*  But they were so bad I had to hide. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5215.84s)]
*  I'm like I just gotta be in this fucking room by myself. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5217.84s)]
*  I gotta listen to music or something. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5220.4s)]
*  I can't do this man. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5222.16s)]
*  I think it's contagious. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5223.92s)]
*  Like you start thinking nothing's funny. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5225.28s)]
*  There's nothing funny in the world. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5227.28s)]
*  Nothing's funny. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5229.04s)]
*  This guy's not funny. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5229.599999999999s)]
*  I feel that. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5230.48s)]
*  But if someone's funny then you feel like oh good I'm loose now. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5231.36s)]
*  They're laughing. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5235.28s)]
*  I'm laughing. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5236.72s)]
*  Everyone's having a good time. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5237.28s)]
*  Also try not to listen too much to other comics before I start trying to write in their voice [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5239.28s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5243.599999999999s)]
*  Well that was a real problem in the come up when people are on their way up. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5245.280000000001s)]
*  A lot of people in New York sound exactly like Dave Attell. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5249.6s)]
*  There was a lot of this. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5253.84s)]
*  There was a lot of punch lines just kind of like Dave. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5255.52s)]
*  And it's just because his rhythm is so funny. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5258.4800000000005s)]
*  He's such a virtuoso that when he's on stage it's so smooth and it just goes into this. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5264.320000000001s)]
*  He's got this flow to him that's so contagious. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5270.96s)]
*  So you want to be funny too. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5274.4s)]
*  You're like maybe I need to talk like that. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5275.44s)]
*  I need to talk like Dave. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5278.32s)]
*  There's a lot of guys who get caught up in other people's. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5280.32s)]
*  I did it for a while. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5283.44s)]
*  I caught myself on stage once when I was an open mic'er. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5284.5599999999995s)]
*  I sounded exactly like Richard Jenney. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5287.44s)]
*  I was a giant Richard Jenney fan. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5289.76s)]
*  And I sounded like I was doing like his timing. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5291.68s)]
*  Like his it was like I was like oh no. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5294.88s)]
*  I realized it while I was doing I was like yuck. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5299.6s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5303.12s)]
*  I feel like a lot of the comedians I see in New York would talk very fast. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5304.32s)]
*  And then I kind of tried to do that. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5309.76s)]
*  And I tried to do that when I first started doing stand up too. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5312.72s)]
*  I'd be so nervous. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5315.44s)]
*  I'm just trying to get it out already. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5316.32s)]
*  But I can't talk that fast. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5318.48s)]
*  And some people will get mad. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5320.4s)]
*  That's some of the feedback I've gotten back on stand up. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5323.6s)]
*  It's like ah it's just too slow for me. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5325.68s)]
*  But I can't talk that fast because I won't be able to enunciate. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5327.6s)]
*  I think it's because my tongue is kind of big. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5332.0s)]
*  I got like this white ass tongue. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5334.32s)]
*  So this guy I bet you if he sees he's going to freak out. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5336.16s)]
*  He loves like the credit. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5340.88s)]
*  There's a guy named Bobby Goldsmith in Dallas [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5342.56s)]
*  who would go to the back door open mic a lot. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5345.2s)]
*  And one time he told me he was like hey man you're like you're funny. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5347.68s)]
*  You have good material. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5353.12s)]
*  He's like but the audience doesn't know it because you're talking too fast. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5354.4800000000005s)]
*  And you don't enunciate. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5357.12s)]
*  He's like slow down. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5358.56s)]
*  He's like talk slow. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5360.24s)]
*  And so I just let's just fuck it. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5362.4s)]
*  Like I put the nerves to the side. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5364.16s)]
*  I just said the jokes as if I was reading them off a paper. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5367.04s)]
*  I started getting more laughs. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5370.16s)]
*  And I was just like man like now I'm kind of finding my timing with it. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5371.919999999999s)]
*  But like I'll never be able to talk super fast. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5376.08s)]
*  You won't fucking understand. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5378.639999999999s)]
*  Some dudes mumble. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5380.4s)]
*  And then when they get on stage they mumbled like Ari used to mumble. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5382.5599999999995s)]
*  And it was hard to understand what I go dude. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5386.24s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck you're saying. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5388.48s)]
*  I'm your friend. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5389.919999999999s)]
*  You got to clean those words up. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5391.5199999999995s)]
*  Make those words real clear. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5394.16s)]
*  These people don't know you. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5397.04s)]
*  You're a professional orator. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5399.12s)]
*  Stop mumbling. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5401.12s)]
*  I feel like I'm still learning how to hold the mic. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5401.919999999999s)]
*  Sometimes I'm like 30 minutes into a set and I just angle it up a bit. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5405.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like that sounds better. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5409.2s)]
*  Or you switch hands. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5411.919999999999s)]
*  I used to only have to hold it in my right hand. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5413.2s)]
*  Now it seems like I don't want to use my right hand anymore. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5415.28s)]
*  I want to hold it with my left. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5417.599999999999s)]
*  And I switch back and forth. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5419.04s)]
*  For like years. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5420.88s)]
*  I'll switch sometimes but yeah I can't. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5421.68s)]
*  I have to hold it in my left. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5424.400000000001s)]
*  That's the other thing about Joey. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5425.6s)]
*  He's the funniest guy ever that just leaves the mic in the stand. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5426.8s)]
*  He never takes the mic out of that stand. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5430.16s)]
*  People always like hype up the chair. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5431.4400000000005s)]

*  Like you got to figure it out. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5441.6s)]
*  Not just anybody can sit in the chair. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5443.28s)]
*  It's only Cosby and Ali that can figure that out. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5445.28s)]
*  But I think like funny is funny. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5448.16s)]
*  When you're listening to a comedy album you're not like oh yeah he's in the chair. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5450.48s)]

*  I don't even think I have like that eye. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5670.0s)]
*  Like to be able to see somebody early on and be like nah I think they got something or maybe later on. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5672.16s)]
*  But don't you if they make you laugh. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5676.4800000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5684.08s)]
*  But sometimes man I don't know. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5684.56s)]
*  You ever do that thing where you're watching a comic and even though they say something hilarious [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5685.92s)]
*  sometimes you don't laugh you're just fucking thinking about what they said like dissecting it. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5690.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5693.52s)]
*  But then there's people who do just make me laugh and I'm like holy fuck I couldn't even think about it. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5693.84s)]
*  Like I didn't even have time to think about it. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5698.08s)]
*  It just made me laugh. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5699.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah there's some guy like when Hicks came along you know Hicks came along now and all of a sudden [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5700.400000000001s)]
*  everybody wanted to say something. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5706.64s)]
*  It was so interesting. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5709.12s)]
*  Because before that like even Richard Jennings he said I remember he was talking about watching Hicks. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5710.48s)]
*  He goes every time I watch Hicks I keep thinking gosh Bob should be doing more like that. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5715.44s)]
*  Or something. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5720.639999999999s)]
*  I should really say something because he would just say shit. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5721.04s)]
*  This is you got to realize Hicks is before the internet. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5723.919999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5727.919999999999s)]
*  This is Hicks was huge in like 88 to when did he die. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5728.639999999999s)]
*  I think he died in like 93. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5734.799999999999s)]
*  When did Hicks die. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5738.08s)]
*  I think he was actually 95 because I think I'd already made my way 94. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5739.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5744.4800000000005s)]
*  So I'd already made my way to California when I heard that he died. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5744.96s)]
*  You be careful with this thing I feel like I'm. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5749.52s)]
*  No flip the top push the top up. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5751.44s)]
*  This thing. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5753.44s)]
*  Yeah push that over there you go. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5754.0s)]
*  Now hit that thing there you go. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5755.68s)]
*  Technology. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5757.12s)]
*  It's crafty. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5758.08s)]
*  Shout out to Calibri. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5759.28s)]
*  But Hicks was so this was like there was no podcast back then there was no audiobooks. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5762.88s)]
*  So when Hicks was talking about shit he was he had like a different base of knowledge [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5769.12s)]
*  that he was working from than most comics. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5775.28s)]
*  He was like really well read. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5777.76s)]
*  He would quote Noam Chomsky. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5780.0s)]
*  You know he would he he had material that was like who's that Noam Chomsky. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5781.84s)]
*  He's a linguist who is a very famous public intellectual who used to have [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5787.28s)]
*  like debates with people on television. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5794.4800000000005s)]
*  He's like one of the most measured and interesting people from like the 1960s [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5796.4s)]
*  and 1970s on foreign policy and all kinds of interesting interesting things. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5800.5599999999995s)]
*  But the point is like Hicks had this he knew more about more things than other comics did. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5808.16s)]
*  And when he talked about things when he talked about like the scams of war [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5815.12s)]
*  and you know and what the fuck is going on in society it was like wow this guy's like [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5818.879999999999s)]
*  super insightful. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5823.84s)]
*  And then everybody wanted to be so insightful too. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5825.4400000000005s)]
*  So there's a bunch of Hicks clones. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5827.52s)]
*  So there's a punchline in Atlanta. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5828.96s)]
*  There was a green room and a bunch of people signed the walls in the green room shit. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5832.08s)]
*  You know you know those are. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5835.12s)]
*  And then this one thing just said quit trying to be Hicks. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5836.56s)]
*  And I was like oh and when Jamie moved the club he said he was going to save that for me. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5841.76s)]
*  I don't know what happened with that. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5847.2s)]
*  I'm like that would be a beautiful piece of ancient comedy history. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5848.32s)]
*  You got to be you. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5854.16s)]
*  Yeah but that was there was a lot of Hicks clones a lot of guys who wanted everybody [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5855.4400000000005s)]
*  to think they were really smart. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5860.16s)]
*  But Hicks was really smart. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5861.360000000001s)]
*  Like he wasn't trying to get people to think he's really smart. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5863.12s)]
*  He was really smart and he just like had thoughts that he wanted to get out. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5866.32s)]
*  And there was no podcast back then. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5871.52s)]
*  So all his thoughts he had to like all his ideas and philosophy he had to get out in comedy. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5873.28s)]
*  So it was like deeper than other comedians. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5878.96s)]
*  It was very interesting and you know some comics think it wasn't as funny as other comics. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5882.64s)]
*  Like okay yeah he's not as funny as Kinnison but he had some fascinating points that made you think. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5887.12s)]
*  And you left the show and you're like you were more you were stimulated in different ways. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5896.24s)]
*  It was interesting and it was funny. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5901.12s)]
*  It was very interesting though. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5902.72s)]

*  You have one non sequitur into another non sequitur. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=5971.76s)]

*  but there was a comedy club down the street from like the club scene in Dallas. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6204.32s)]

*  He's a door guy. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6241.28s)]

*  The piece of floor that's elevated six inches higher than the rest of it on the couch. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6292.08s)]

*  Drinking in some place some shitty place until 4 a.m. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6328.56s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6331.04s)]
*  On New Year's was my first show back home. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6332.56s)]
*  And it was my first time settling out back home. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6336.96s)]
*  I was like I'm gonna get it out. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6339.839999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna do that what I saw them do and how they used to shit on me. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6341.5199999999995s)]

*  I'm gonna go to a club with my friends. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6346.4s)]
*  I'm gonna get a bottle and I'm gonna just go all out. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6348.08s)]
*  See what see what it feels like. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6350.16s)]
*  It was fucking awesome for like an hour. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6353.839999999999s)]
*  And then people start trying to like test you. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6356.96s)]
*  And I'm like nah bro. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6360.799999999999s)]
*  I'm not fit to get into shit over this fucking 6 by 6 foot piece of real estate that I'm never gonna own. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6362.56s)]
*  How are they testing you? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6369.28s)]
*  Oh they start trying to stand on your section. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6370.4800000000005s)]
*  So you're standing on the main floor. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6373.4400000000005s)]
*  But if you take one step back you're six inches elevated on the other little platform here. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6376.08s)]
*  Which is my section that I paid like 300 bucks for for the night. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6381.28s)]
*  And you gotta like tell them bro get off my section. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6385.4400000000005s)]
*  Or you just get you just get more strangers on your section. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6388.400000000001s)]
*  And they're doing it on purpose. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6392.72s)]
*  Because it's like this ego like I'm the man in here. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6394.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6397.68s)]
*  Yeah so it was fun for a minute. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6399.28s)]
*  But I'm like nah I'd rather not do that dude. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6401.2s)]
*  I'd rather not do that. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6403.6s)]
*  So after that if I do go to clubs or bars I'll never buy a section again. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6404.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not gonna pay extra money for elevated floor just so people can fucking try to. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6409.360000000001s)]
*  Like I'm the man I'm the man. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6413.92s)]
*  Like if I'm gonna go out there I'm gonna just get drunk. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6414.96s)]
*  Might do some shrooms. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6417.92s)]
*  I'm gonna have a good time no matter where the fuck I'm at. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6418.96s)]
*  I think you're better off in a dive bar with your sensibilities. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6421.04s)]
*  Yeah this the reason why people do that is because they don't have other things going on. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6425.5199999999995s)]
*  The reason why someone wants to be the guy with the corner or these six inches elevated [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6430.4s)]
*  and wear all the gold chains and the big watch and all the jewelry and shit. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6435.2s)]
*  It's because that's like the way you stand out. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6439.76s)]
*  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do though. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6442.0s)]
*  I'm still gonna go back and shit on these people. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6443.2s)]
*  But I'll tell you how I'm gonna do it. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6445.76s)]
*  How you gonna do it? [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6447.36s)]
*  I'm gonna buy the 1989 Michael Keaton Batmobile. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6448.16s)]
*  And when they see me pulling up to that in the club or leaving in that how can you top that? [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6453.2s)]
*  You did whatever you had to do in the club. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6458.4s)]
*  You threw your money. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6460.48s)]

*  Yeah whenever I look at a pilot, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6550.32s)]
*  like if you get to look and get on a plane, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6552.24s)]
*  you peek through where the pilots are. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6554.639999999999s)]
*  See all that shit they got? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6556.48s)]
*  Imagine if the pilot died and you had to figure those things out. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6557.92s)]

*  Do you ever hate when you're like out and about and it's raining? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6615.76s)]
*  I like rain but I like it when I'm home. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6617.92s)]
*  Well one thing that rain does do for you, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6620.16s)]
*  if you spend a week in the rain when you get back home, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6622.16s)]
*  especially like somewhere like California where it's like sunny, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6624.64s)]
*  it's like oh my god it feels amazing. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6627.28s)]
*  It feels amazing. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6630.0s)]
*  Like you don't know what the sun really feels like until you've been like dumped on [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6631.28s)]
*  in a tent every day for a week. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6634.88s)]
*  All right. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6638.0s)]

*  I probably never dry out. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6639.6s)]
*  I think I need that because right now I'm sick of the sun. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6640.96s)]
*  Fuck the sun. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6643.12s)]
*  It's because you live in a place that has great weather. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6645.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6647.76s)]
*  California that's the number one thing people get spoiled by is that weather. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6648.4s)]
*  That weather's perfect. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6651.599999999999s)]
*  That's why everybody moved there initially to do films [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6652.879999999999s)]
*  because they could do movies out there and it was never raining. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6655.679999999999s)]
*  You never had like if you had an outdoor scene and it rained you were fucked. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6659.36s)]

*  I think it's from the 1970s. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6679.12s)]
*  It's one of them Clint Eastwood movies. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6680.64s)]
*  Oh I love Clint Eastwood bro. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6682.24s)]
*  Clint Eastwood is the type of guy that when I first saw him on a movie like an old movie [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6683.92s)]
*  I was like whoa what if he's racist but even if he was he's fucking badass. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6688.16s)]
*  He could be racist all he wants. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6692.0s)]
*  I saw him on like those old westerns shooting Mexicans. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6693.92s)]
*  I was like fuck it bro do what you gotta do. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6696.4800000000005s)]

*  It's actually like a ghost. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6702.56s)]
*  Let me put this cigar in my mouth as I write so I can feel like I'm writing like big numbers. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6703.36s)]
*  It's a ghost story. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6706.16s)]
*  It's about a dude who gets a spoiler alert. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6708.4s)]
*  It's a movie from the 70s right. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6711.28s)]
*  What year was that movie? [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6712.88s)]
*  73. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6714.72s)]
*  It's about a guy who gets whipped to death. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6715.92s)]
*  He's the sheriff in this town. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6718.08s)]
*  He gets whipped to death and he comes back. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6719.36s)]
*  He comes back and kills everybody. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6723.76s)]
*  He comes back as Clint Eastwood. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6725.28s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6726.96s)]
*  They don't they don't recognize that it's him because he looks totally different. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6727.52s)]
*  Kind of like Chucky. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6730.64s)]
*  But he appears out of nowhere in the beginning of the movie. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6731.6s)]
*  It's like this fucking heat. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6734.24s)]
*  Those heat waves that you see when you look on a highway. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6736.639999999999s)]
*  It's like it looks like Mirage. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6739.12s)]
*  So this heat wave he just appears out of nowhere in this heat wave rides into town. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6740.96s)]
*  Fucks the whole town up kills everybody and then rides back out the same way and disappears. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6744.5599999999995s)]

*  Goes back to hell. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6750.24s)]
*  He painted the whole town red. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6751.36s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6753.12s)]
*  Yeah it's a wild movie but it's also a wild movie because it's a time capsule. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6753.679999999999s)]
*  Like you have to look at old movies and imagine you're living in 1973. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6758.24s)]
*  You can't look at an old movie from 2023 and think from a 2023 perspective. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6763.04s)]
*  1970s movies are some of the best films and I feel like if it's a good movie I will just [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6767.68s)]
*  kind of get captured in it and when I do go out and about again I was like oh shit what the fuck. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6774.24s)]
*  There's some great movies. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6778.8s)]
*  I like I don't I don't know there's like a point to this movie or what's this. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6780.08s)]
*  This is High Plains Drifter. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6783.76s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6792.96s)]
*  He's a man with no name. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6804.4s)]
*  I fucking love that. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=6805.92s)]

*  Bro, I went to a satanic wedding with Duncan Trussell. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7716.66s)]
*  Duncan Trussell, he has this character called Little Hobo, [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7721.3s)]
*  and Little Hobo is a puppet, and he brings Little Hobo out, [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7724.58s)]
*  and he tells everybody that his grandfather just died, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7727.38s)]
*  and he left behind his puppet. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7729.62s)]
*  This is a satanic puppet. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7731.9400000000005s)]
*  It's one of the funniest bits I've ever seen in my life. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7733.54s)]
*  It's an amazing bit. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7736.18s)]
*  So he does this guy who is like Anton LeVey's grandson, [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7737.860000000001s)]
*  I think. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7744.58s)]
*  They're satanists. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7745.22s)]
*  So they hired Duncan to do this routine at a satanic wedding. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7746.740000000001s)]
*  I go to the satanic wedding, and I take a picture with this dude, [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7751.7s)]
*  and to this day, people think I'm a satanist now, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7755.860000000001s)]
*  because I was like, fuck you. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7758.820000000001s)]
*  I was like, this is so ridiculous. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7760.900000000001s)]
*  They're just silly people. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7762.1s)]
*  I don't know if they're doing real satanic shit when we're not around. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7763.860000000001s)]
*  But I was like, I expected it to be like, [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7767.139999999999s)]
*  I wanted to just experience it. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7770.0199999999995s)]
*  So we went, we got barbecued. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7772.0199999999995s)]
*  We were off the rails. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7773.7s)]
*  We were in another dimension. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7775.0599999999995s)]
*  We were looking at life through a water-covered shower door. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7776.58s)]
*  Everything was very strange. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7782.9s)]
*  And so to me watching Duncan do this Little Hobo routine [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7784.9s)]
*  in front of all these fucking satanists, it was just wild. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7789.299999999999s)]
*  But it was hilarious. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7792.0199999999995s)]
*  It was a fun time. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7793.299999999999s)]
*  But they were just like, I don't know what their thing is. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7794.5s)]
*  Duncan says they're just hedonists. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7797.62s)]
*  They don't follow any rules, [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7799.06s)]
*  and that's what they think of as satanism. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7800.42s)]
*  But maybe they do some creepy shit, like sacrifice. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7802.42s)]
*  I bet you even in the religion of worshipping satan, [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7805.46s)]
*  there's different forms of it. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7809.86s)]
*  I'm sure. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7811.22s)]
*  I bet you even they're just like, you're not doing it, right? [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7812.1s)]
*  This is how you do it. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7814.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7815.22s)]
*  There's probably hardcore satanists who really are out there murdering homeless folks. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7815.78s)]
*  And then there's other people that are just dressing up like devils. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7820.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7823.94s)]
*  I remember seeing some shit on TV one time where they're like, [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7824.34s)]
*  there's rules to it. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7827.3s)]
*  Like, they're like, if you're a satanist, [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7828.34s)]
*  there's their own 10 commandments. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7833.38s)]
*  You're not supposed to kill animals unless it's necessary for food. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7835.3s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7839.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7839.94s)]
*  Never harm children or women or some shit. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7840.34s)]
*  They have rules that even the devil's like, all right, bro, this is even too far. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7843.22s)]
*  We'll find out when we get to hell. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7848.66s)]
*  What was who was the guy that stumbled upon that satanist place in the middle of the woods? [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7850.34s)]
*  Remember, there's that one dude that we had on. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7857.9400000000005s)]
*  And there was a there's this guy who used to work for NASA, [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7862.18s)]
*  who was a real satanist, like in the Church of Satan. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7867.780000000001s)]
*  And this abandoned place where this guy used to do his research at, [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7872.58s)]
*  someone went to visit it. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7877.700000000001s)]
*  Who was it? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7879.3s)]
*  But this guy like was it Python Cowboy? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7879.78s)]
*  But like what time frame is this that he works at NASA? [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7884.099999999999s)]
*  Like did he help us get to the moon? [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7886.82s)]
*  My 1960s, 1950s or 1960s. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7888.74s)]
*  I think the 50s. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7892.179999999999s)]
*  So it was in the 90s. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7893.38s)]
*  Let's go back and find out. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7894.74s)]

*  And like some nerdy glasses. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7905.54s)]
*  He was like an open satanist. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7906.9s)]
*  You could kind of be an open satanist and still be a rocket scientist in the 1960s. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7909.3s)]
*  They hadn't figured out that that was kind of fucked up yet. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7913.3s)]

*  most of them came from Nazi Germany. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7922.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7925.14s)]
*  There's a thing called Operation Paperclip. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7926.34s)]
*  In Operation Paperclip, the United States acquired all of Germany's rocket scientists, [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7928.9800000000005s)]
*  including Werner von Braun. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=7935.62s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8002.1s)]
*  So the 1930s, when the Suicide Squad began conducting their explosive experiments, [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8002.34s)]
*  rocket science belonged largely to the realm of science fiction. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8007.46s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8011.38s)]

*  It was mostly science fiction. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8017.22s)]
*  This guy was like a legit rocket scientist who's also a satanist. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8018.34s)]
*  So this guy's place, this python cowboy dude, went to this guy's place. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8022.02s)]
*  And he said there's like blood splatter on the walls. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8025.94s)]
*  There was like a chair that had like this red puddle underneath it. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8028.9s)]
*  He was like... [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8032.66s)]
*  It creeped him the fuck out and he ran out of there. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8033.219999999999s)]
*  This is it. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8035.299999999999s)]
*  That guy went to his place? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8037.139999999999s)]
*  Well, he went to the space rocket facility and people were... [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8038.179999999999s)]
*  He said there was all sorts of stuff on the walls. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8042.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8043.86s)]
*  I said there's like... [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8044.099999999999s)]
*  Look, they've got these people spray painted upside down crosses on the rocks and shit. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8044.9s)]
*  I know he had video footage up, but he said it's really creepy. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8050.5s)]
*  So this is him when he's stumbling upon... [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8053.94s)]
*  They got Latin written on the walls and it's weird. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8057.54s)]
*  So a lot of these places, I guess, these satanists had come in and they're doing [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8061.139999999999s)]
*  like their little rituals in this place, little psychos. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8067.0599999999995s)]
*  Earlier when I said that we went to follow technology, I'm starting to take it back. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8070.179999999999s)]
*  Take it back. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8074.179999999999s)]
*  Now I feel like, hey man, kill some time on Netflix or Instagram. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8074.9s)]
*  Don't go spray paint upside down crossing the stuff. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8077.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8080.339999999999s)]
*  Don't be sacrificing people in the woods. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8080.82s)]
*  Go get Disney Plus or something. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8082.66s)]
*  Yeah. Get Paramount Plus. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8084.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8085.54s)]
*  Go watch the new South Park one, the Pandaverse. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8085.86s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8088.099999999999s)]
*  But there's always been people that are doing secret things on the fringe. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8090.42s)]
*  There's always been people like that, that are doing forbidden secret things in society. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8095.7s)]
*  Yeah. Little penis people. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8100.66s)]
*  That has to be what it is. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8104.099999999999s)]
*  You got to find something to obsess about. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8106.0199999999995s)]
*  You got to distract people from your real issue sometimes. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8109.139999999999s)]
*  I think there's also people that are in these elite circles of world leaders and shit like that. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8113.139999999999s)]
*  I think they probably like to do the creepiest, most deranged shit secretly. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8120.18s)]
*  They have these little secret societies together. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8126.34s)]
*  For sure. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8128.82s)]
*  It's always been the case. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8129.94s)]
*  There's got to be some weird shit going on. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8130.9s)]
*  Too much time and money on your hands can lead to some like, [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8132.66s)]
*  how do I achieve the next level of being elite? [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8136.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8139.86s)]
*  There was this guy. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8141.22s)]
*  When I used to go work at my dad's body shop, we'd stop at this gas station sometimes. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8144.98s)]
*  That area was a lot of like, it's like a hood area that would neighbor the mansion area. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8148.58s)]
*  There's a lot of rich folk around there too. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8155.3s)]
*  Sometimes, man, there'd be people doing weird shit. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8157.62s)]
*  There was a guy, his little memory still goes through my head. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8159.78s)]
*  Not like elite weird shit, but just weird. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8162.34s)]
*  There was a guy who would hold his paintings from his house. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8164.26s)]
*  He had like really nice paintings. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8168.98s)]
*  He had like an old school, I don't remember what he drove. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8172.419999999999s)]
*  It was fucking expensive. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8175.54s)]
*  I just remember this guy's like, Rich! [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8176.5s)]
*  He'd just hold these fucking paintings and just stand on the street like a homeless man. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8178.74s)]
*  Just wanted everybody to see his painting? [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8184.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he's just nuts. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8185.299999999999s)]
*  He's just fucking rich, crazy guy with way too much time on his hands. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8186.099999999999s)]
*  And when I saw that, I was like, bro, once you reach a level of money, [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8189.78s)]
*  you probably just do crazy shit just for the fuck out. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8194.98s)]
*  Just because you can, you know what I mean? [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8198.26s)]
*  Especially if all you do is make money. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8200.1s)]
*  That's what those dominatrix ladies always say. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8203.060000000001s)]
*  Their clients are always these guys who are like these CEOs of mega corporations. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8205.7s)]
*  They just want to get pissed on and yell that and slap. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8210.900000000001s)]
*  It's fucking nuts. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8213.94s)]
*  Yeah, they want to get tied up and thrown in the corner. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8214.74s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8217.7s)]
*  They come over and kick them in the balls. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8218.74s)]
*  Because they want that. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8220.26s)]
*  Bro, did you ever see that movie? [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8221.62s)]
*  I mean, it's like they made the movie about the movie, The Room. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8224.980000000001s)]
*  That was like Tommy Wise, what's his name? [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8228.5s)]
*  I don't remember his name. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8230.740000000002s)]
*  I was messing it up. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8231.460000000001s)]
*  But there's that scene in the movie that made fun of the movie where Joe Rogan's character, [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8232.900000000001s)]
*  the director goes to the bank and he's like, I want to cash this check. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8238.58s)]
*  And they're like, oh yeah. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8241.7s)]
*  And he's like, holy shit, it worked. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8243.060000000001s)]
*  And the bank tellers tell him, he's just like, this guy's bank account. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8244.5s)]
*  It's like a bottomless pit. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8248.02s)]
*  That amount of money has to be kind of scary though. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8250.02s)]
*  Because you either go make shitty movies with your money, [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8252.900000000001s)]
*  then you don't know what the fuck you're doing. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8255.460000000001s)]
*  Like that guy, which is funny. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8256.82s)]
*  Or you probably also do scary shit. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8258.5s)]
*  That's a scary amount of money to have. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8260.98s)]
*  So I know people who struggle financially are probably like, oh man, if I could just [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8262.66s)]
*  have this money, if I could just have that money. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8267.3s)]
*  Yeah, life would be easier. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8268.82s)]
*  But if there's no challenge, if there's no maze to run through, [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8270.02s)]
*  what are you really going to do with that much free time? [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8272.74s)]
*  I'll tell you what you're going to do. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8274.66s)]
*  You're going to get in a homemade submarine and die in the ocean. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8275.539999999999s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8278.42s)]
*  Like those dudes. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8279.3s)]
*  That's exactly what that was like. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8280.9s)]
*  That was $250,000 a ticket to get in that submarine. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8282.02s)]
*  And die. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8286.58s)]
*  Why? [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8287.140000000001s)]
*  And the submarine had no windows, right? [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8287.62s)]
*  Well, it had like little small windows. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8289.62s)]
*  You don't really see, you're seeing things through a screen. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8291.54s)]
*  Call me old school, but I feel like if I spent $250,000 on the ticket, [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8294.18s)]
*  I want like a luxurious experience. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8298.26s)]
*  I want to see the fucking ocean, not through a tiny little screen. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8300.34s)]
*  I want communication with the outside world. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8304.02s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8306.1s)]

*  He's not even holding him right on the leash. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8988.82s)]
*  It's called bullets. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8990.58s)]
*  You've developed a dangerous animal that wants to bite people. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8992.98s)]
*  That's a fucked up dog, man. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8995.859999999999s)]
*  Take that dog out. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8996.98s)]

*  Somebody did something bad to that dog. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=8998.58s)]
*  Or that dog was ignored or not trained or something went really wrong. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9000.34s)]
*  Man, so that's a working dog. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9004.74s)]
*  When my dog scratched my sister, he was able to get a little clenched. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9005.86s)]
*  After that shit, man, I did start to like try to research like why the fuck do dogs just flip [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9009.380000000001s)]
*  or what could there be another reason? [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9014.42s)]
*  Apparently, like dogs will remember a traumatizing moment for the rest of their lives. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9017.14s)]
*  Did your sister do something to the dog? [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9022.74s)]
*  So now I'm wondering, right, like if her or maybe another kid, [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9024.58s)]
*  maybe on accident, hurt it one day when trying to paint, [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9028.98s)]
*  like trying to pet or something, they'll remember that shit. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9031.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9034.26s)]
*  So if like if a cat scratched it once, they'll hate cats forever. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9035.14s)]
*  Or if like, you know what I mean? [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9039.06s)]
*  Yeah, dangerous dogs are fucking scary, man. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9041.779999999999s)]
*  I have a golden retriever. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9045.38s)]
*  He ain't biting nobody. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9046.98s)]
*  He's a friendly dog. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9048.26s)]

*  He's a demon to squirrels. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9059.939999999999s)]
*  I fuck with cats sometimes. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9061.619999999999s)]
*  I know a lot of people hate cats, but I'm not like a super attentive, [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9062.82s)]

*  And I feel like dogs kind of need that or they get sad. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9068.66s)]
*  They definitely do. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9070.82s)]
*  And I don't have a cat, but. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9071.619999999999s)]
*  If you're going to go on the road, having a dog is rough. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9073.06s)]
*  Like, you know, if you're on the road all the time, [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9075.539999999999s)]
*  that dog is going to get ignored on the weekends. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9077.539999999999s)]
*  Also, I don't like to be that guy who like carries around little dog. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9080.02s)]
*  I mean, respect to the people that do, but I'm not going to be. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9083.22s)]
*  So bring a little dog with you on the road, like a little chihuahua. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9086.02s)]
*  No offense to the comics that do, but it's kind of girly. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9088.74s)]
*  Yeah, but if you know, where's truffles? [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9092.74s)]
*  Likes it. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9095.22s)]
*  Like Peter Shore, the brother of Pauly Shore, [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9096.66s)]
*  he was always bringing his little dog to the comic store. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9100.82s)]
*  Dog's adorable. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9103.14s)]
*  But I don't know. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9104.18s)]
*  I'm not going to do it. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9105.62s)]
*  But then when I do see, not every comic, I don't love everybody's dog. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9106.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9110.58s)]
*  I like dogs. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9110.98s)]
*  I don't like everybody's dog. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9111.62s)]
*  But there are some comics that I see their dog. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9113.38s)]
*  I'm like, all right, that's a cool dog. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9115.22s)]
*  And then there are other comics where they have their dog and I'm like, that's gay. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9117.06s)]
*  Ron, I had a really cool French bulldog named Mustard. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9120.18s)]
*  Mustard got taken by a coyote. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9124.18s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9126.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9127.619999999999s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9128.9s)]
*  That's a cool ass name, too. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9129.619999999999s)]
*  Mustard. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9130.74s)]
*  Yeah, coyotes are that's a weird little animal that lives alongside people [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9131.22s)]
*  because it's really a little wolf. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9136.019999999999s)]
*  It's a little wolf that lives alongside people and eats your pets. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9137.939999999999s)]
*  Fucking coyotes. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9141.779999999999s)]
*  They're creepers. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9143.06s)]
*  I hope the wolf. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9144.019999999999s)]
*  I hope the wolf got that coyote. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9144.9s)]
*  Well, that's why coyotes are so dangerous. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9146.74s)]
*  Not dangerous, but one of the interesting things about coyotes is coyotes evolved around wolves, [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9150.02s)]
*  but they evolved around gray and gray wolves kill coyotes. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9155.539999999999s)]
*  They don't breed with them. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9158.74s)]
*  The eastern wolves, like red wolves, they breed with coyotes and you get the coy wolf. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9159.86s)]
*  It's like a hybrid wolf coyote. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9163.78s)]
*  Not in the West. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9165.699999999999s)]
*  So the Western wolves, they just killed coyotes. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9166.74s)]
*  So when coyotes would lose one of the members, the female coyotes would have more babies. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9169.699999999999s)]
*  So when they would call out, one of them was missing. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9174.9s)]
*  It would send some sort of a biological process into the female coyotes [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9178.02s)]
*  and they would have more pups. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9182.26s)]
*  And then they would spread out into new territories. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9184.5s)]
*  Were you raised by wolves? [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9187.14s)]
*  I had a man on the podcast named Dan Flores. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9189.14s)]
*  He wrote an amazing book called Coyote America that I read. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9191.699999999999s)]
*  And it's all about the history of the coyote in North America. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9194.9s)]
*  It's in every city. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9198.5s)]
*  Coyotes are in every city in every state and they didn't used to be. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9199.699999999999s)]
*  They used to be confined mostly to the West and the Southwest. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9203.06s)]
*  But because of human beings, like moving in and killing coyotes and trying to force them out [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9206.26s)]
*  and then agriculture and all these different things, they just kept spreading out. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9211.779999999999s)]
*  And now they're everywhere. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9214.58s)]
*  Every city, New York City has coyotes in it. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9216.34s)]
*  For real? [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9218.34s)]
*  For real. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9218.9s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9219.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we'll show you some photos. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9220.1s)]
*  I was watching that movie Collateral with Tom Cruise. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9222.1s)]
*  Great fucking movie. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9227.699999999999s)]
*  There's like a coyote that goes in there. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9228.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9230.019999999999s)]
*  I remember when I saw that, I was like, I bet that'll happen in Cadley because they [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9230.42s)]
*  got like hills and shit. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9233.54s)]
*  But man, now I'm like, that could happen anywhere. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9235.14s)]
*  Well, the first time I ever saw a coyote was in 94 when I first moved to LA. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9237.38s)]
*  And I was staying at this place in Burbank called the Oakwood Gardens. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9241.94s)]
*  This is a place where when you move to a new place, they rented out pre-furnished apartments. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9244.9s)]
*  So it already had a couch, already had a bed. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9250.02s)]
*  You just bring in your clothes, you're good. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9252.02s)]
*  It's like a hotel, but you live in it. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9253.86s)]
*  It's an apartment. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9255.3s)]
*  And I was pulling up to the place and my rental car and I saw [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9256.42s)]
*  three little dogs. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9260.42s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck is that? [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9262.18s)]
*  What are those things? [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9263.54s)]
*  And then as I got closer, I'm like, oh shit, those are coyotes in the middle of Burbank. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9264.74s)]
*  God damn. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9269.06s)]
*  Just hanging out in the street. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9269.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's one on the roof in New York City. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9271.7s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9274.18s)]
*  How the fuck does it even get there? [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9275.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9276.74s)]
*  You ever see those videos of like bears swimming up on the shore in Florida? [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9277.14s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9282.82s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9283.54s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of bears. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9284.66s)]
*  I'm already like, you're already trying to watch out for sharks. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9285.380000000001s)]
*  I ain't got to watch out for bears too. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9287.54s)]
*  There's too much. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9289.3s)]
*  Didn't some lady get killed recently by a bear in Florida? [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9290.42s)]
*  I think some woman got killed by a black bear in Florida. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9294.179999999998s)]
*  There are a lot of bears in Florida. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9296.98s)]
*  That's just too much. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9300.58s)]
*  I know, it's crazy. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9302.179999999998s)]
*  Florida's got everything, man. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9303.14s)]
*  They got alligators, pythons, iguanas, bears. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9304.179999999998s)]
*  That's like getting killed by a bear at the Mall of America. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9308.259999999998s)]
*  It wasn't supposed to happen there. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9310.66s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9312.179999999998s)]
*  How the fuck did it end up there? [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9313.14s)]
*  Imagine a bear getting into the Mall of America and just running through people. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9314.9s)]
*  That's a big mall. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9318.74s)]
*  But that's Minneapolis, right? [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9320.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9322.82s)]
*  Someone's going to have a gun. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9324.66s)]
*  Someone's going to shoot that fucking bear. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9326.9s)]
*  How many bullets do you think it takes though to take down a bear? [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9327.54s)]
*  From a 9mm? [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9329.7s)]
*  It depends on what kind of bear. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9330.66s)]
*  If it's a grizzly bear, you're fucked. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9332.02s)]
*  You need something heavy. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9334.1s)]
*  You need a .45 or .10. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9335.06s)]
*  You can't, a 9mm is not enough stopping power. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9337.460000000001s)]
*  You really want like a .300 Winman. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9340.34s)]
*  You want a rifle. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9342.02s)]
*  You got a bear. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9343.460000000001s)]
*  You want a large caliber weapon to take that fucking thing out. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9344.18s)]
*  You do not want a bear wounded that's still running at you. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9347.14s)]
*  And your bullets are going in a couple of inches. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9350.66s)]
*  And it's just ready to fuck you up. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9353.06s)]
*  You walk around with a gun. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9355.3s)]
*  You don't have to answer that. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9356.34s)]
*  I wouldn't answer that. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9358.019999999999s)]
*  But if I was around a lot of grizzly bears, I would definitely have a gun. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9362.5s)]
*  I know people that go in grizzly country. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9367.38s)]
*  They don't bring a gun. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9368.82s)]
*  I'm like, what are you doing? [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9369.539999999999s)]
*  Do you want to die by the way of being eaten by a giant wild dog? [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9371.539999999999s)]
*  I think it's crazy that people like go to hikes in places where there's bears. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9376.26s)]
*  I mean, I get it. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9382.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9383.22s)]
*  You want to experience. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9383.7s)]
*  Well, I think if you live in a place like Montana or something like that, [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9385.06s)]
*  it's just a part of the world. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9387.94s)]
*  The world has grizzly bears in it. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9389.94s)]
*  You know, they just they coexist with them. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9391.54s)]
*  You hope you don't run upon a mama and her cubs. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9393.62s)]
*  That's the scariest thing. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9395.7s)]
*  Scariest thing is accidentally stumbling upon a mama grizzly bear with her cubs. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9397.54s)]
*  You ever gone hunting? [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9401.86s)]

*  fucking trail. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9410.58s)]
*  It wasn't even like a trail. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9411.86s)]
*  We're trying to get to like a river to go fishing. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9412.740000000002s)]
*  And they were saying that there's like wild hogs out there that come at you. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9415.54s)]
*  And I kind of like that. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9419.220000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't know if I if I'd want to like hunt, like wait for the animal spotted or whatever. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9420.980000000001s)]

*  Then you have to eat it too. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9431.460000000001s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9433.220000000001s)]

*  There's so many of them here. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9476.66s)]
*  They hunt them by helicopter. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9477.94s)]
*  There's like fucking they're not coyotes, but there's a lot of dogs, man, [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9479.46s)]
*  out there where I live out in the country. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9483.3s)]
*  I had to get used to that when I first moved out. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9485.06s)]
*  Wild dogs? [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9487.06s)]
*  Yeah, or even like- [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9488.02s)]
*  Just strays running around. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9489.14s)]
*  They're strays and the people that own dogs just kind of let them be out. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9490.42s)]
*  And I had to get used to that because I was just living like in a regular fucking neighborhood [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9495.3s)]
*  and if I wanted to go jog sometimes there's some shit. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9499.7s)]
*  Sometimes I just go out and run. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9502.02s)]
*  One night I just started running and I started getting chased by dogs. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9504.1s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9508.66s)]
*  There was a fucking dog just coming at me from- [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9508.9s)]
*  Everybody out there has like a pretty big piece of land. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9512.18s)]
*  It's like trailer homes and shit. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9514.82s)]
*  And I just saw it leave the porch and started coming at me. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9516.66s)]
*  But I was pretty far where I'm like, bro, if I just chop, if I just run as fast as I can, [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9519.3s)]
*  I don't think it's going to come that far. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9523.38s)]
*  And then another dog started coming. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9525.779999999999s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9527.3s)]
*  So I just took off. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9528.58s)]
*  I took off and I finally got away like far, far. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9529.859999999999s)]
*  And I had to call my sister to come pick me up. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9532.74s)]
*  I'm like, I can't even jog back. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9534.66s)]
*  Like I can't run back, man. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9536.099999999999s)]
*  The dog's probably waiting for you. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9538.34s)]
*  Like that dude's going to come back. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9539.699999999999s)]

*  Yeah, I think they were waiting. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9541.619999999999s)]
*  Fucking country ass dogs. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9543.3s)]
*  Well, that's what happens to people with mountain lions too. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9544.98s)]
*  The mountain lions see them running and they're just like, where you going, bitch? [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9547.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9550.980000000001s)]
*  It's like their instincts. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9551.140000000001s)]
*  Their instincts. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9551.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9552.820000000002s)]
*  Even I see people running. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9553.78s)]
*  Wild dogs in Texas appear to carry DNA of wolf declared extinct. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9554.820000000002s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9558.66s)]
*  That's a Texas dog right there. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9560.26s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9561.78s)]
*  There were, I didn't see it what year, but there were previously red wolves [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9563.140000000001s)]
*  and gray wolves in Texas that are supposedly extinct. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9566.26s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9569.220000000001s)]
*  And so there might be still wolves in Texas? [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9571.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9573.060000000001s)]
*  When I was, this other. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9573.300000000001s)]
*  Is that what they think? [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9575.140000000001s)]
*  It said that they're, what kind of dogs are in Texas. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9575.94s)]
*  There's coyotes impacts of neglected domestic dogs running around. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9577.86s)]
*  Wow. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9580.82s)]
*  But there were also. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9581.54s)]
*  I like how they say neglected. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9582.26s)]
*  Like I know they mean like nobody's taking care of them, but it also just feels like [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9583.7s)]
*  maybe the dog wanted attention. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9587.86s)]
*  They've just been neglected. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9590.26s)]
*  However, Texas was once home to two wolf species, the gray wolf and the red wolf, [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9591.78s)]
*  but sadly they were hunted to extinction in the Lone Star State. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9595.54s)]
*  Sadly, if you're not a rancher. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9598.9s)]
*  If you're a rancher is like good. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9601.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9602.5s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9603.86s)]
*  I have a friend who lives in BC, like Northern BC, British Columbia, and they they'll occasionally [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9605.46s)]
*  a wolf will just like, they'll have like a pack of wolves that like takes out a calf [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9611.38s)]
*  and they'll hear it in the middle of the night. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9615.7s)]
*  Just horrible sounds of like wolves that are like ripping apart a cow. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9616.98s)]
*  And then, you know, other people find out about it and they have to deal with them. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9622.1s)]
*  And I ran into a dude once at the airport and I think I had like a camouflage jacket [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9624.98s)]
*  or something like that. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9630.74s)]
*  And he goes, are you a hunter? [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9631.619999999999s)]
*  I go, I didn't know what to say because he was like a regular dude. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9634.019999999999s)]
*  I was like, I hope this isn't an argument. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9636.5s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I was up here moose hunting. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9639.46s)]
*  And he goes, he goes, we like to wolf hunt up here. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9641.3s)]
*  He goes, yeah, we got a real problem with wolves. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9644.019999999999s)]
*  He just starts telling me about wolves. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9646.26s)]
*  And I go, what do you do? [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9647.859999999999s)]
*  He goes, well, we take like a like a garbage pail and we throw scraps of meat in there [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9648.66s)]
*  and then we freeze it. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9654.18s)]
*  And then we take it and we'll put that in the middle of a field and then we hide. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9655.539999999999s)]
*  And if the wolves get desperate enough, they'll smell it. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9659.699999999999s)]
*  And they'll come to that frozen meat. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9662.82s)]
*  And then you just take them out. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9664.42s)]
*  I was like, Jesus. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9665.779999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9666.66s)]
*  I go, how many do you kill? [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9667.3s)]
*  He goes, you can't even put a dent in the population. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9668.42s)]
*  Bro, imagine that's your life. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9670.82s)]
*  Imagine you have to make time during the week to go try to put a dent in this population. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9672.9s)]
*  Yeah, so you can't even put a dent in the population. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9678.74s)]
*  He goes, the smart ones never fall for it because they've like been got before. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9680.58s)]
*  They saw one of their pack get killed before that way. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9684.9s)]
*  The fucking smart ones don't fall for it. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9687.3s)]
*  So wolves are smartening up to this shit too. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9689.38s)]
*  Oh, they'll wait. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9691.46s)]
*  They'll wait. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9692.179999999998s)]
*  And then they'll have the young ones are stupid. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9692.82s)]
*  The young, stupid ones will go in there and get shot. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9694.66s)]
*  The wolves are only going to get smarter. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9698.019999999999s)]
*  They're only going to get smarter. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9699.859999999999s)]
*  And eventually these wolves are going to figure out how to fuck with your Instagram algorithm [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9700.98s)]
*  and give you bad wolf killing techniques. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=9705.699999999999s)]

*  But it's sad because there's one way they treat you when you're with the baby tigers. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10027.46s)]
*  So if you're with the baby, you can get in this pen where these little baby tigers are [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10032.74s)]
*  and they're little tiny tigers. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10037.06s)]
*  But everybody's like they're watching. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10038.66s)]
*  People are watching everything, making sure nothing gets crazy, guys have sticks and shit. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10040.5s)]
*  And then you get to like a little older tigers and they're a little more sketched out. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10044.5s)]
*  Then they're like the people will block. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10048.5s)]
*  You can't take a picture sitting right next to the little tigers. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10050.5s)]
*  You know the ones that are like 50, 60 pounds? [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10053.78s)]
*  You can't do that. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10055.699999999999s)]
*  And then they get older and you can take pictures with them because they're drugged up. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10056.82s)]
*  So there's a tiger that's on heroin. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10060.5s)]
*  Just sitting there like this. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10062.1s)]
*  And then people are taking selfies with this tiger. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10063.140000000001s)]
*  But if you watch that tiger, the tiger is doped up. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10065.06s)]
*  100% doped up. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10068.02s)]
*  That's why you can go in there and take pictures with them. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10069.7s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this is fucked up. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10071.86s)]
*  Like this is sad. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10073.54s)]
*  That is pretty sad. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10074.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like that's a pet tiger that you can trust. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10075.7s)]
*  No, the tiger is like, oh. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10078.74s)]
*  I'm sitting there just totally drugged up. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10081.220000000001s)]
*  Those tigers are going to get smart just like the wolves did one day. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10083.300000000001s)]
*  One day they're going to fake the high. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10086.02s)]
*  Or imagine if you cut the tiger off and they get they start jonesing. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10087.78s)]
*  Start having fucking withdrawals. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10091.54s)]
*  Withdrawals. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10093.140000000001s)]
*  So getting really crazy. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10094.18s)]
*  Tigers start sucking dick for drugs. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10095.300000000001s)]
*  Imagine a tiger sucking your dick. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10098.34s)]
*  Please be careful. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10100.02s)]
*  Please. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10101.94s)]
*  Please don't get a flashback. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10102.980000000001s)]
*  All right, Ralph, let's wrap this bitch up. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERHbwFD_5Q&t=10106.980000000001s)]
