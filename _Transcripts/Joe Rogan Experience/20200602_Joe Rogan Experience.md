# Joe Rogan Experience #1484 - Reggie Watts
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 02, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcle87Uvh8Y)
*  No better person to be here at the end of the world than you, Reggie Watts.
*  No finer human being to share this spectacular, chaotic time.
*  Thanks for being here, brother.
*  Thank you, man. My pleasure. Thanks for having me. I'm glad I made it.
*  You were saying, let's do all the things. Let's do the pandemic. Let's do the riots.
*  Everything's happening at the same time.
*  We're going to space.
*  We're in space. We made it to space.
*  We just need some kind of a meteor, like a meteor that's going to be here in a month.
*  We have to decide what to do.
*  Well, it would be rioting. We'd be out of control.
*  Yes.
*  Apparently, according to Nick Swartz, there's some crazy UFO sightings over Idaho.
*  What?
*  I haven't heard anything about this, but he said there's some nutty UFO sightings over Idaho.
*  They might be coming in to end this experiment.
*  They might be like, you fucking crazy chimp.
*  We tried. We tried to let you guys sort it out, but you're not sorting out shit.
*  You guys are getting worse.
*  I know. I remember I was asked a question, what do you think humanity will have?
*  If there was on a gravestone, what would humanity say on humanity's gravestone?
*  And I said, well, we tried.
*  We gave the old college a try.
*  We gave it a shot. We tried. We really tried.
*  It's such a strange time, man. And it keeps getting stranger.
*  It's like, did you see that in India, the monkeys stole the coronavirus samples from the lab?
*  Yes. Totally. A gang of monkeys that were like, give me that.
*  And they gave it to them.
*  But the funny thing is they didn't get into it, so they actually were able to keep the specimens intact, which I thought was kind of crazy.
*  I wonder what the monkeys thought it was.
*  I don't know. They were probably just like, well, the way they're holding it looks important. I better take it.
*  Yeah, well, they do that apparently. And then you can give them food and they'll give it back to you.
*  They'll make deals. Yeah. Oh, the barter. Yeah.
*  They make deals depending on the monkeys, depending on the territory. But if you're used to deals with people.
*  That's so amazing. Oh, they're so smart, man. Yeah.
*  They're like really dumb people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Which is saying a lot. It's crazy. Like dumb people.
*  Because they'll fucking. Did you see the one where the monkey ran, used the motorcycle and rode up to the baby and stole the baby?
*  What? Oh, my goodness. Are you serious?
*  Must pull this one up. It is the crazy. I don't. I think I don't want to say Indonesia.
*  Also on a leash. I don't know if you noticed that the monkey was on a leash.
*  Yes. Somebody had him like by that's how it's what's why it came back so fast.
*  Oh, but it was on the road. It was struggling, though. It was like crazy.
*  Yeah. The monkey rode a motorcycle down this alley to these people that were sitting there, grabs a baby and starts dragging the baby away.
*  Watch this. Here goes. See, here's the monkey on the motorcycle.
*  Hold on. Do it from the beginning. I did. I did. He rode up on a motorcycle.
*  But do it from the beginning so he could see it.
*  Watch this. See on the motorcycle. Pulls up, jumps off, grabs that baby, just grabs him and pulling the baby away.
*  I mean, first of all, how fucking strong are monkeys?
*  Yeah, they're really. I like how casual the dude is, though.
*  The guy is like, hey, try not to have your monkey take my baby away.
*  Jamie, where do you see this leash?
*  No, the monkey is getting dragged away. It's not walking away. Oh, oh, monkey. It's getting dragged too.
*  Oh, it's just holding. He's holding on to the baby and he's being dragged.
*  Is that 100 percent sure? It's crazy.
*  It's not walking away with the baby. Yeah, because he's being yanked and he's trying to go for the kid.
*  So the guy is trying to probably get him away from the kid.
*  That's insane. And that's probably why the guy is so casual, too.
*  I mean, I still don't know why he's being casual about that. But wow.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  That's so terrifying. And you know that kid's going to grow up and go like, yeah, that happened.
*  A lot of stuff happens.
*  That makes sense because otherwise, how the fuck would a monkey know how to ride a motorcycle?
*  Like somebody had to teach that monkey.
*  Definitely. It's not like monkeys going like, gosh, someday I can't wait to ride a motorcycle.
*  But maybe if monkeys saw like, it's a small motorcycle, too, right? It's like a little kid's motorcycle.
*  Yeah, like probably electric.
*  If someone saw like a monkey saw a person do something, a monkey could probably copy it.
*  Like they definitely. There's a photo. I don't know if you've ever seen it.
*  Monkey see monkey do. That stuff's good, right? Yeah, this stuff is really good.
*  Yeah, killcliffs the shit. 25 milligrams of CBD and it's delicious.
*  There's a photograph, a famous photograph of a orangutan that is spearfishing.
*  And it learned how to do it by watching people. Look at this monkey.
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's getting after it. Oh, my gosh. That's so cool.
*  Wow. That's so rad. It's in Asia, Indonesia.
*  So it is Indonesia where I think that's what what they were saying.
*  The other one was, see if you can find the photo of the orangutan that's spearfishing.
*  So it's hanging from a branch with a spear and sticking it into the water to stab a fish,
*  just like it's seen humans do, because that's how the people fish there.
*  Right. So the orangutan is like, huh, I think I got that. I think I got it.
*  Wild orangutan spearfishing. That's so crazy to me.
*  Well, they've said that they believe that primates, particularly some monkeys
*  and some chimps are in the Stone Age now. I see. I see. I see.
*  They're starting to use tools. They're entering into the Stone Age.
*  So look at that photo. Wow. How dope is that? Whoa. That's crazy.
*  That's crazy. That's amazing. Look how he's hanging with his feet and his hands.
*  Yeah, man. And just stabbing into the water at fish.
*  A plant of the apes, man. Fuck. What's happening?
*  Well, look, we've got to think. I mean, if you believe in evolution, and I do,
*  I do too. We were that. Yeah. Yeah. We were some. We were some form of that.
*  Some form of that. Something happened. Something happened that caused us to do it.
*  What's going to happen if they start talking to us? I don't know.
*  But you know, we're going to figure out some kind of a computer that's able to
*  read every tiny micro movement and interpret it into words. Right.
*  And they'll be like, mood, and then words. Gestures.
*  And like, oh, I think it's saying this, and it's just going to get better and better and better.
*  Well, what was that gorilla that they taught sign language? Was it a name?
*  Was that Jane Goodall? Was she the one? She was the one.
*  And she used sign language with primates, I think.
*  Yeah, but there was one that was really good at it.
*  Oh, in the zoo? I don't know if it was in the zoo, if it was in some sort of a research center.
*  I see. But there was one gorilla that could really talk up a storm.
*  Like, had like pretty... Coco? Coco, that's right. Oh yeah, Coco, that's right.
*  Yeah, had conversations with sign language. That's so heavy. I know.
*  Yeah, look at this. Oh, Robin Williams hung out with her?
*  Hey, Mr. Rogers. Oh, Mr. Rogers. Imagine. Whoa, look at her. Look at her head.
*  I mean, imagine if... Yeah, that's so crazy.
*  Have you ever seen the humanzee? No. Oh, I'm going to blow you away.
*  There was this one weird chimp that they were really confused about it.
*  They actually thought it might be a hybrid between a human and a chimp.
*  Because I want to say this was like the 50s or the 60s. It was really freaky.
*  And this lady kept it. And I think they eventually had to bring it to some sort of a rescue center
*  because it developed a very unhealthy sexual relationship with this lady.
*  Like, it wanted to fuck her and was like real jealous of other people coming by.
*  Which is... Yeah, that's what happens with male chimp. That's crazy. Of course. Yeah, territorial. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  They say that's what happened to that lady that had that big chimp in Connecticut.
*  Remember that chimp who went to bit her friend's face off? Yes.
*  Her friend was cock-blocking. Whoa. Heavy. And she might actually have fucked that chimp.
*  Because she used to sleep in the bed with it and she gave that chimp Xanax and red wine.
*  Which is probably not this human thing.
*  I can't find accuracy of it. It says there was an unsuccessful attempt to create such a thing.
*  No, no, no. It's just a chimp. It's just a weird looking chimp.
*  But one of the weird parts about it is that it liked to walk on two feet.
*  Like to walk on two feet and it looked like a person.
*  It looked like a person fucked a chimp. Yeah. Look at him. Oh, wow. Dude, it's creepy.
*  He had... Yeah, get a look. Oh, yeah. I have seen a picture of this person.
*  Go to that one in the far... Go to the second row, second to the far left. The black and white one.
*  Oh, this one? Yeah, that one. Look at that one. What in the fuck, man?
*  Wow, that is... I want to think he says his name was Oliver.
*  Yeah, that's what it's saying. Yeah. Wow. So, it's name was Oliver.
*  But look at the weird facial expression. Particularly in that one image.
*  Now, as he got older, he looked more and more just like a chimp.
*  But one of the weird things about him... See if you can find a video of it.
*  Oliver the Humanzy. He used to walk on his back feet. So, it was real creepy.
*  And so, that's part of the reason why there was all the speculation that maybe it was some sort of a hybrid.
*  It makes sense that there would be definitely a... There's got to be outliers.
*  Because so much genetic information is shared between all of the animals on the planet, including us.
*  And we have bits and pieces of all of it. Oh my gosh, interesting.
*  Weird. Yeah, could be an outlier.
*  Yeah, well they did a DNA test on it because it had a very bald face as well.
*  Which is one of the other reasons why I think they had some speculation. There was some human in it.
*  But they found out it was just a chimp. Just a weird chimp.
*  Yeah, just like a... Yeah, just a unique... So bizarre.
*  Yeah, super strange. But I mean, you've got to think if human beings, they think in this form that we're at,
*  we've only been around in this form for somewhere in the neighborhood of 250,000 to 450,000 years or something like that.
*  They don't really know. But I think on the short end, it's like quarter million years.
*  That's not that long.
*  Oh no, I mean it's weird if you look at the evolutionary, like the lines, we just go...
*  It's just a departure. Something happened.
*  Aliens.
*  I know. I personally...
*  It's my favorite thing to think of.
*  It's my 90%. I always go to the 90%. I'm 10% wrong, but I'm also 90% probably.
*  When I'm high, I'm 100%.
*  Yeah, something alien. I mean, mushrooms are aliens.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  I think so.
*  They probably came from other places in the universe. There's probably a bunch of lichens,
*  like hybrid fungus and molds that work synergistically. Whatever, who knows?
*  Well, psilocybin can survive, the spores can survive in a vacuum.
*  Oh really?
*  They can survive in the vacuum of space.
*  Oh man.
*  They can survive in extreme temperatures and extreme cold.
*  Interesting.
*  So the idea of panspermia, that idea that building blocks of life came from asteroid impacts.
*  Right.
*  They think that it's really possible that some sort of fungus could exist on an asteroid.
*  We have chunks of the moon in Antarctica and other parts of the world where some big asteroid hits,
*  or a meteor hits the moon, a big chunk flies off, it gets sucked into our gravity, and slams into Earth.
*  And if that can happen, you can get some fungus on that, some sort of spores.
*  Yeah, I mean, because water bears survive in space as well.
*  Yep.
*  And those are more complex.
*  Those tardigrades, what a weird looking animal that thing is.
*  I know, it's the stuff that you don't want to look too much at when you are tripping,
*  because it gives me existential dread.
*  I'm like, I don't know what I am anymore.
*  I don't know what any of us are.
*  Look at his face.
*  Look at that tardigrade's face.
*  It's so awesome.
*  It looks like it's made of cardboard, like someone shaped it with a paper mache.
*  Or velvet.
*  Yeah, or velvet.
*  Like a velvet balloon.
*  It's just an amazing, yeah, I mean life is...
*  It's kind of like a buzzsaw tube for a nose.
*  Like it's mouth.
*  It's like, what a fucking freaky looking nose.
*  What is it, a mouth, I guess?
*  How does it even sense?
*  I guess it just must be moving and probably, I guess, smelling nutrients.
*  And nothing kills them other than like squashing them, right?
*  They're really, really, really small.
*  Yeah, they're really, really tiny, tiny, and they can exist in space.
*  Can you see them with the human eye?
*  I don't think you could.
*  There's no way.
*  I mean that looks like scanning electron microscope imagery.
*  What a fucking weird... and it's got little legs.
*  Yeah, I mean that's what's fucked up, right?
*  Is that all life comes from...
*  I mean the first life that we believe happened on this planet comes from a single cell.
*  So it went from a single cell to multiple cells to something like that.
*  And then eventually you get a whale or a dolphin.
*  Or a fucking seagull.
*  Pick a life form.
*  It's like, yeah, I mean it never ceases to amaze me.
*  It just goes on and on and on and the more that you look, they're like, if they're atoms, are they alive?
*  They're definitely not alive. They're just building blocks.
*  But then what's the definition of life if it's using energy and it's creating energy?
*  Then there's sentience and awareness and consciousness and all that stuff.
*  But it's all around us, man. We're like, we're infinitely inside of it.
*  What is that? What is the narration saying?
*  Something about a special protein?
*  They're disordered because unlike most other proteins, they don't maintain a 3D structure.
*  How exactly do they work to protect the water bear though?
*  They call them water bears. It's still a mystery.
*  What's clear though is that it could have big implications for humans.
*  Yeah, great. You fucking creepy scientists.
*  You want to turn us into tardigrades to keep us from getting cancer.
*  It's like, well if we harness the T cells from the human being and take bits of tardigrade
*  and we are able to integrate, we just have to get people comfortable with a new shape.
*  It's all science. I mean, we really are. We're just a big experiment ourselves.
*  Creepy looking little fuckers.
*  We only like what we are. We like what we look like.
*  I mean, yeah, that kind of goes to what's happening now even with all these riots and protests and all this stuff.
*  I was talking to a friend about it, my drummer Guillermo.
*  He grew up similarly, mostly white culture.
*  I have him half white, half black, so I have my French mom and my African American dad who is from Cleveland, Ohio.
*  And so the mixture of the two plus the fact that they were married in 1967, 68, and in the United States it still wasn't legal to marry interracially.
*  That's during my lifetime. How crazy is that? If you want to talk about the history of racism, during my lifetime it was not legal for African Americans to marry white people.
*  That's correct. And also, and then the Chinese had their own pathway too. They had to, I think they were later.
*  After that, huh?
*  I think so, yeah. I think so.
*  But there's a, it's just like, you know, all that stuff when I think about like how much like went on and to get me to a point at which I can just be chill and be like, oh, hey, what's up?
*  You know, like, I'm going to go buy a snack now. I have to like, I have to think about that because it's, you know, my mom reminds me all the time, thankfully, because I tend to operate from like, I'm a human first.
*  And my characteristics and my character and the way that I treat other people is the primary thing that I'm working from.
*  And I'm aware of that. I look a certain way that might trigger certain people, but that's not how I operate. I don't operate from that.
*  I go for the character first. Then if I start to detect there's something else happening, then I can modulate and figure something out.
*  But I don't want to constantly assume which growing up in Montana, I would have blown, I would have exploded if that was the way I was doing stuff.
*  Because most of the time, Montanans, even if they're kind of, I'm uncomfortable with a black person, even if that was the case.
*  And I come up and I'm having a conversation with them. And after a while, they're like, oh, that's cool. Oh, you helped me with my thing. Oh, yeah. Thanks for a lot for all. That's cool.
*  And then we're just kind of getting along and they didn't even realize it. It's like a sneak attack.
*  What part of Montana did you grow up in?
*  I grew up in Great Falls.
*  Where's that? What's that near? What's the big city that's near? There's no big city. What's the closest?
*  It's the closest would be the capital, Helena. But it's not. It's but Great Falls is I think is bigger than Helena.
*  So Great Falls, about sixty five thousand. But it's got an Air Force base and it's got an oil refinery and some canneries like from Budweiser and Pepsi.
*  Were you there because someone in your family was in the military?
*  Yeah, my dad. Yeah, my dad was a two time Vietnam vet. First was in the army.
*  Then he left the army after four years and then applied with the Air Force and then went back and got in the Air Force and they sent him back again.
*  Holy shit.
*  Which was kind of crazy. But then he survived it. You know, moved to France or moved to a base in Germany because they were decommissioning.
*  Remember like in France we had bases, United States had bases and then Charles de Gaulle at the time was like, we don't want your bases in here anymore.
*  So all your bases belong to us. All your bases belong to us.
*  Yes, we will absorb your bases and the United States like, oh, no, we'll get out of there first.
*  And we're like, OK. But yes, so he was helping to decommission a base. That's how he met my mom. Oh, wow. Yeah.
*  His name is Charles and they met in a bar called the Charlie Bar, which I thought was kind of.
*  Wow. And then just decided to go to Montana because the base was there.
*  No, well, he we were stationed for a second. We went all over Europe.
*  So I was born in Stuttgart. Then we moved around Spain, Italy, I think.
*  Yes, Spain and Italy. And then when I was four years old, they we had a choice of two places to go to and they picked Montana because Montana had better had a better school system or something at the time.
*  And then I moved there when I was four and I wasn't even a citizen.
*  I was a citizen of nothing until I was four years old or five years old. Yeah. So I was a noncitizen.
*  How weird is that? That's really weird. It's not weird.
*  It's it's it is weird. Yeah, it's not weird because the circumstance.
*  Well, it's not weird because you're a human being on Earth. It's weird that you have to like be assigned a patch of dirt.
*  I know. They are. You know, I know. I know. Well, tribe.
*  Do you belong to young and it's like, I don't know. I haven't decided. He has not decided.
*  The young one has not decided. I mean, it was I mean, it's weird if I think about it.
*  I'm a kind of an immigrant, but not kind of not. Well, you're American. Yeah. You have American parents.
*  I even if like Brian Callan was born in.
*  Fuck, where was he born? He was born in somewhere freaky.
*  Maybe Saudi Arabia, like Abu Dhabi or something like that, something outlandish because his family was on the road all the time as well. Right. Yeah.
*  Same same sort of deal. Yeah. Well, you're kind of not you're not a citizen.
*  I forget what they call it. There's a status for that. But trader. It's a trader. Yeah, it's a trader or a spy.
*  Insider. Yes. A spy. Yes. Someone not to be trusted. Yeah, totally.
*  He's the perfect one. He's not connected to anyone. He has no children.
*  No, I mean, yeah, I guess it was like I was in Montana when I remember I kind of vaguely remember being in the courthouse and being made a citizen.
*  Oh, wow. Of the United States. You're four. And I was five, I think. Yeah.
*  So for four. So I was like in the United States. Like I wasn't in.
*  I was a non citizen of the I was a non citizen of the world.
*  And then then I became an American citizen. So strange. Yeah.
*  Very, very strange. I think about it. It's like all the ingredients are insane.
*  Like I'm so I'm so stoked. I got to grow up where I got to grow up and I had the experiences that I got to experience.
*  And I love Montana and I love my friends from Montana and I like being a guy that people never expect is from Montana.
*  And it's like, well, you're you're an unusual guy in that you're very left wing like me, but you're also very Second Amendment pro Second Amendment.
*  For sure. Like me. Yeah. You know, I find like you and I have very big parallels on that. That's true.
*  You know, all for everyone's rights, like for everything.
*  I mean, just I want people to be free. Yeah. Do whatever. Yep.
*  But when shit like this goes down and people are just randomly lighting targets on fire and, you know, and smashing windows and stealing things and knocking cars over and pulling people out of trucks.
*  And now you understand that the veneer of civilization is very thin and the chaos of being is very deep.
*  And it's I don't ever want to have to use a gun ever. No, no, no. Human being ever in my life.
*  If I if I make it to the grave and never have encountered anyone that I needed to shoot to protect my or my my loved ones lives, I'll be a happy person.
*  Yes, of course. But I'd be much happier if I get to make that choice.
*  You know, and I get to I have the opportunity or the ability to protect myself or to protect someone I care about.
*  Well, I mean, it's like it depends on the climate that you're you know, we live in a climate that is like for very so many reasons have we've gotten to this point at which essentially I could just say a blank.
*  The blanket blame goes to capitalism in general.
*  I mean, I'm sure like you talk about this on this on the show a lot and capitalism in its most fundamental state is just essentially trade.
*  It's what humans did at a you know, you set up a fruit stand and like someone's got bread and someone's got you know, and you trade and then there's kind of like an understood value for things.
*  And on a basic level, it's just kind of what we do as human beings. We barter, we trade things like that.
*  Things like that. But then you flash forward and you like overlay complexity over complexity over complexity that is then guided by people who are like, oh, I can game the system a little bit more.
*  I can game the system a little bit more. And now you get all these hoarders and hoarders and people and choke points of resources.
*  Right. And so then they're they're kind of dictating the value, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Same thing goes with the arms.
*  You know, it's like, yeah, I enjoy the reason why I enjoy my ability to have a firearm is because I respect their power.
*  I'm in I'm an engineered mind, the minded person. So I like the engineering and the craftsmanship behind it.
*  And I like the responsibility and the safety factor of it that people take it seriously.
*  When I grew up, people were really adamant about the safety of guns, like everything that whenever I touched a gun, looked at a gun before you pick it up.
*  They'd be like, never put your finger on the trigger, never pointed at anybody unless you plan on firing it.
*  All the things that we all hear about that gun owners are supposed to be taught.
*  And so growing up with guns, I didn't really fear them. They were just a thing.
*  You know, and my my whole mom's side of the family is all police, police people.
*  And my dad was a military policeman. He was in the military. So, you know, guns like that was just a part of the thing.
*  All that stuff. Great fall. Same thing.
*  Growing up in my friend's house, seeing a deer hung up strung up on the rafters with a bunch of cardboard on the ground, you know, getting ready to be processed.
*  All of that stuff. And for me, I came back to guns like maybe like 10 years ago or something like that because I wanted to I was interested in training and overcoming my fear of handguns.
*  And and so that fascination was great.
*  And went to Montana and my experiment was like, how long will it take me to get a handgun?
*  You know, and I walked into a sporting goods store.
*  One of my favorites walked in, timed it 20 minutes.
*  I walked out and I had a bag with a handgun and ammunition in the bag.
*  And I was walking out of the store. So there's no waiting period.
*  No, no. You fill out the you know, the background check.
*  You do the background check.
*  They're like, oh, it looks like there's no red flag or whatever.
*  You can have the gun. Wow.
*  Which which part of me is like part of me is like if you're responsible gun owner and you respect firearms, that seems kind of normal.
*  You're like, oh, I'm responsible. I know how to use this weapon safely.
*  I'm going to buy this gun and I'm going to walk out.
*  Right. And that was my first firearm I ever bought.
*  Whilst it was an interesting experiment, I will say and when I talk to all my law enforcement friends in month in Montana, like, you know, who was the guy walked in?
*  He walked in his suit and had a full on three piece suit and then had his carry concealed carry on him and then walked in with a huge bag of like crazy guns.
*  But he is a prosecutor and has to have security when he when he goes to cases and things like that,
*  because when they get convicted, sometimes people stick their friends on them and stuff like that.
*  Anyways, he'd never had any altercations, but an interesting guy, really like very heavily armed, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  And I start talking to him. I was like, what would happen if in order to get a firearm you had to like back when the NRA was the NRA when truly was the NRA,
*  when it was a bunch of like war vets who were like, this is how you use firearms safely.
*  Like way back in those days, if people had to go through training and had to be evaluated, had to pass driving, like when you drive, get your driver's license, you have to get into a car and you have to an instructor there and you have to like pass these tests.
*  And when I talk in that way, they're like, I don't really have a problem with that.
*  And I'm like, yeah, because you're promoting you're only doing yourself a favor.
*  Right. You're promoting safety and you're educating people about firearms.
*  And it's up to them if you want to have a firearm or you don't want to have a firearm.
*  But if you do, you have to know how to safely operate a firearm.
*  And there are many kinds of firearms. They're not all the same thing.
*  Yeah. So anyways, but it was an interesting conversation.
*  That is a powder keg of a conversation. Right.
*  I know. If you even intimate, just just just beat around the bush, that may be a good idea for people to learn how to use a gun before they buy.
*  Trader, fucking trader.
*  Yeah. Fucking Second Amendment is a right.
*  I know. And that's right.
*  I know. And I get and you know, and and it's so funny because that's why I like whenever talking.
*  I've got a bunch of friends. They got concealed carry all the time for their professions in Great Falls.
*  And I'm sitting down with them. They've got a firearm on them.
*  I never feel like nervous or anything like that.
*  But and but they're highly opinionated about people who open carry people who open carry.
*  They're always like those people are almost always concealed carry permit.
*  People always say that those they don't like those people because it's you have a weapon that's visible and it doesn't have a fancy biometric lock on it.
*  There's nothing. It's like if you're in a situation that someone walks up behind you and takes a gun, they just now they've got a gun and you just told everybody you just shown everybody that you have a firearm.
*  And so there's this weird thing about open carry that conceal carry.
*  People are like this is ridiculous.
*  While you can do it if it's legal in your state.
*  Certainly. Is it a good decision?
*  I don't I don't I don't think so.
*  It's probably not a good decision to do it when you just go into Walgreens.
*  That's what I'm saying. It probably exists so that no one can ever infringe upon your rights to have one in any capacity.
*  So if you're sure you know I'm saying it's like it's not a thing where you want to do all the time.
*  But if you if some shit goes down and you have a gun outside of your house, the law should be you could do whatever the fuck you want.
*  Like the law says you're allowed to open carry so you can have this gun outside your house doesn't mean go to the movies with the fucking AK 47 strapped to your chest.
*  Yeah. Which people do.
*  And I get it. And the whole thing about like the gun issue is that it needs to start somewhere and it should start at education.
*  Yes. You know education is the that's the key. Right. Yeah.
*  Like and some people are great at it. Most people that I know that are into guns are very into the safety aspect of it and they understand it.
*  And it's yeah it's very important to them. Yeah.
*  But it's one of those things where first of all here's what's fucking weird.
*  I know so many people that want a gun now. So many people that ask for all these liberal.
*  So many liberal friends of mine are asking me they're like I know you have a gun to deal with.
*  I was like what is the take. I'm like wow. Two different friends who have had friends ask them if they can borrow a gun.
*  Mike you can't loan someone a gun. You can't. You people that are anti gun are hilarious because they don't know that there are rules like this idea that there's no rules.
*  No there's rules. Yes. All they hear about is oh but what about the gun show loophole.
*  They start talking about the gun show. Yeah. Yeah. Go to a gun show then.
*  You see any gun shows. No. Well you can't have my gun. Get the fuck out.
*  I know. I know. It's so that's the thing that's that's the thing that's so hard about it because like for me I'm like I'm a pragmatist.
*  And and to me it's always about awareness. It's always about education.
*  And the thing that the conversation always breaks down on either side where it's like if it's a gun and they're like any hint of something that says we're going to have to talk about this.
*  You know they're like no. And then the people who are really anti gun they're like any hint that there might have to be a compromise made then they're also equally like no.
*  And it's nothing's ever going to get done unless you get soldiers cops people who use guns for who have to use guns for a profession talking to people who are heritage gun owners people who've been growing up for generations doing that to people who live in urban situations where there's illegal gun sales and black market guns and their problem with guns and their communities.
*  All that stuff needs to be talked about. But but the sides are so entrenched it's very very very difficult.
*  Well I think something like we're we're experiencing right now these riots and the looting this opens people's eyes.
*  This is like we're talking about our liberal friends that are very interested in getting a gun now.
*  This opens people's eyes. You realize like this is not no one's on a power trip.
*  You're just talking about your ability to safely defend your loved ones and yourself. That's what that's all you're talking about.
*  Absolutely. 100 percent. You know and I'm my thing is too it's like technology is amazing and and and guns are an interesting form of technology because obviously if again in a healthy situation you're like oh did you see the new blah blah blah blah blah.
*  Oh yeah. They enhance this. Oh yeah. There's a trimount for the silencers. Did you apply for the silencer. I have a class one license all that geeky stuff.
*  It's as geeky as people working on engines and hot rods. Right. Exactly. There's that right. Then there's the whole cultural thing that you movies you know like bad boys and everything just guns are just stuff that people just have and they're just shooting around.
*  And the thing is like people never understand when you talk to a war vet about guns and it's and gunfights and firefights especially recent firefights. They're like I never ever would ever wish you to ever be in a gunfight ever.
*  And so and I and I believe them because I know things can change so quickly. A bullet when you shoot a gun and it hits somebody and it ends their life even if they were like threatening you so forth that is one of the most traumatic things that can happen in the human being's life.
*  And they have to live with that all the time. I mean soldiers at least they have like I'm on a side and I'm trained you know and their psychological health and all that stuff or police officers same thing.
*  Most of them never even draw their weapons but when they do and they do fire it the consequences are devastating on a psychological level. But I will say that you know my friend who carries I was like what if the first three rounds that you have in your personal protection gun like at home or whatever your handgun whatever it is.
*  What if the first three rounds were rubber and then there were live rounds after that. And he was like oh that's an interesting idea. And I'm like anything to protect yourself but not necessarily guarantee that you're going to kill kill somebody if it's you know if it's a weird situation.
*  Situations happen fast and I understand when someone comes into your house all bets are off. Whatever you need to do however you feel if someone breaks into your house that's I understand that completely. But for me I'm like what can I do to make it really hard for someone to even get to me in the first place.
*  And my last last last resort is a weapon that can kill somebody. That's my very very very last but I'm going to do everything I can to be as preemptive as possible to not be enticing for people to want to come up and attack.
*  Yeah these rubber bullets that these cops are using on protesters how fucked up is this that they're just shooting them into people.
*  Yeah directly. Yeah. They're supposed to hit them off the ground.
*  They're shooting them at fucking reporters. You see those reporters reporters interviewing these people and like what the fuck. Yes. They're just getting shot at. I know by cops that know their reporters. Yes I know.
*  And a reporter lost her eye recently. ABC reporter someone like that. Yeah it got hit in the eye with a rubber bullet just recently like yesterday or something like that. Oh my God. And lost an eye.
*  That happened to when I was at the WTO riots. You know like one second you're like oh cool. The chief of police is talking to the lead organizer and he's got his helmet off and everyone's like oh this is cool.
*  They're all talking and then from behind the police lines you hear a bullhorn. We're going to be launching tear gas. Please clear the area. And you're like wait a minute. But you guys were just talking.
*  It's like oh I don't know. And he doesn't know because that was another order placed by someone that wasn't him. And then suddenly turns into pandemonium. And the next thing you know another dude loses a guy that I knew that was a friend of a friend lost his eye in the WTO riots because the guy that the police officer shot at him directly instead of bouncing it off the ground.
*  It's just like and it comes down to my gun my gun guru dude that I was you know training with for a film and that's kind of what launched me back into into stuff. But he was saying training training training.
*  Like when it comes to police officers it's community outreach reach being able to actually establish a contact with your community so that you they can at least have some form of trust or someone that they can talk to that they can relate to.
*  So they understand the police are there for the protection. Then the other thing is like training. A lot of these officers are just like they're just sending them out and going hey good luck. Deal with stuff as it happens. And then some of the cats are like they don't know.
*  Their anger gets the best of them. Someone's being indignant and they're like you know what I'm going to lay it down.
*  I just think most people do not have the kind of temperament and character to deal with being in a position of having control over other people.
*  Really ultimate fatal control over other people. I just don't think they have that. I think most people I mean I think that takes a really powerful person and there are powerful people out there that handle it handle it well and they're great cops.
*  Yes. And then there's guys like that guy who put his fucking knee on that man's neck for eight minutes and 38 seconds or whatever it was. And finally the family got their own autopsy and the autopsy showed the man did die from from.
*  Not just asphyxiation but also from the blood being cut off to the brain which is really what it is. It's a blood choke because you're putting your shin on the side of the neck. It's cutting off the carotid artery.
*  It's like a joke like like a jujitsu choke. The idea that that's not what killed him is like come on. What was just a coincidence. I mean what is the autopsy. How corrupt are your fucking medical medical examiners.
*  Man I'm telling you it's yeah I know where they're like oh we need to get we need to get ahead of this. And it's like you know just like we just like he had pre-existing conditions. Yeah. Yeah. It's called being black. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That was the existing condition.
*  I know. I know. Oh my god. It's called being black and being arrested especially by that guy. That guy had 12 different abuse forms that were abuse claims against him over the years. Yeah I know. And the guys that were just kind of sitting there you know the cops that were sitting there it's like they again it's also a training issue.
*  It's like you know and if you're a cop and you you you've noticed another fellow officer in the field doing some shit that they think is like not cool or just straight illegal whatever or they have a feeling that it's going to escalate with this person if they're if it's left unchecked they really it's hard for them to communicate.
*  Yeah. Because there's this whole brotherhood loyalty thing that locks everybody into like this code of silence and it sucks because well how do you expect police departments to get better if police departments aren't allowing themselves to get better.
*  Well some some people that do step out they get in trouble. Right. Some people that do call out other officers for shitty behavior but there was one woman really recently. I think it was either yesterday or today. There was a guy and he's arguing with these protesters this male cop and this woman gets on her knees in front of him and says she's on her knees and he shoves her to the ground when she's on her knees. And this female officer gets in the guy's face and starts yelling at him.
*  And as he's walking away she's chasing him down and yelling at him. Oh God. And it's all on video. So there are examples of good cops who see cops being abusive. Yes. And this guy was clearly abusive. Like there's one guy standing there and he got right in the guy's face like intimidating him and then he pushed the girl down.
*  Look there's a lot of people that shouldn't be cops and then the stress of those situations where you're trying to try to take control of a mob. Yes. You know it turns bad or you get that sheriff from Flint Michigan. Did you see that video. That was amazing. That was amazing. Beautiful brings a tear to your eye. Really. He's like we're going to put down the batons. We're going to march with you. Yes. We're all together in this. Yes. And you know and we want you to have a voice. Yeah. And then he's hugging people and everybody's hugging everybody. Yeah. And they're walking together. So imagine
*  the cop that pushed the lady down and put him in that situation with those people. Yeah. That same aggro attitude. He'd be yelling at people and tell them to shut the fuck up and pushed him away and it probably escalated. Or imagine that cop with in the other scenario with that woman on the ground.
*  He'd probably be like ma'am I don't want you on your knees. We're all in this together like we all saw what happened to that man. It's an injustice. Yeah. Let's walk together. Let's let's try to heal this community. Let's try. Let's try to do better. Yeah. That's what I want to see man. I mean that's all it that's all it comes down to.
*  It's a you know I it's all about behavior how you handle a situation in the moment. And again if they had a little bit of training just a little bit of training to say like stop before think stop think then assess the situation.
*  And you know unless your life is in danger like you know but that these situations are not that these are cops that are like something happens. There's like something clicks and there's chaos all around. And the instinct is like essentially the same mentality as someone who's taking advantage of it on the other side.
*  Here are like the people who come out after the initial rage wave of like ah you know which is a natural kind of biological instinct and it's a rebalancing. But then there are the opportunists that sneak in behind the wave. And those are the people that you see like targeting in a very organized way targeting these stores knowing exactly where they're going to go and they're going to take advantage of these moments of chaos. Yes. And of course that gets mixed in and the cops see that and it's like well they kind of get on get in on that wavelength instead of the majority.
*  Wavelength which is just like we're pissed we're emotional we're loud but we're allowed to do this. Have you seen these bricks that people have been finding at all these different sites where people are protesting these organized stacks of bricks. No. Yeah man. Look this is I'm going to send Jamie I'm going to send you one that Eddie sent me. Who do you think is putting that. That's the question right. It's like who is who is putting that is it Antifa. Is it the cops. It's is it someone who was.
*  Want someone to throw a brick so that they can impart martial law. Like what is it. Yeah. You know my my brain always goes to conspiratorial. Here it is mysterious brick piles appear throughout major protest cities. I mean these are these are bricks that are appearing that don't have a reason to be there. Jamie I'm going to send you this video that Eddie sent me because this is a lot of air drop to you buddy. God man. It's the car to the big car they said in. Yes.
*  Left a car out there. They left a really shitty car. A fucking free car for people to just take a free police car. So they left an old shitty police car out there and then on top of that this this old. Why is this not. OK. Jamie I'm air dropping to you right now. So this old shitty police car and then these three you have all these protesters and then these three people move in a very organized fashion. And there's a guy who made a video about it. Have you seen the video Jamie where the guy breaks down.
*  These are the antifa. Have you seen that. I'll send you the video because what's that. I never saw this. Yeah. OK. Put it up on the screen. I got to figure out how to do it. OK. Photos. Oh I see. That's so crazy. So there's these. There it is. So these random pallets of bricks. This is very organized. This is on Ventura Boulevard out here in L.A. or I think it's in North Hollywood. So these pallets of bricks are just sitting there. Look at this. What. Yeah. Just like like.
*  Riot Supplies. Exactly. Riot Supplies. What. Exactly. So who's doing this. This is very organized. I mean many stacks of these bricks. It's very anti anarchist. What is it. It's organized. But I mean what I mean. Well it's fuel for anarchy. Right. Yeah. But I just I wonder. Look look at this. Or do you think. Do you think. I mean here's another theory. It could be possibly performance art. I mean I mean and I'm not saying that like as a joke but like so.
*  Some performance artists like go to that length but that's very very organized and very ominous and very weird. I mean I hope that those are reported that the police like picked them up. Well one thing that is happening that's promising is these provocateurs. Yeah. Are getting caught by actual Black Lives Matter protest. Yes. Grabbing them. And these assholes that are breaking windows and spray painting things like they're grabbing these people and saying hey fuck. And they're turning these people in like these people are smashing things.
*  But they're recognizing that this is damaging to this. Look there's a great moment in time right now where we can enact real change. You know you can. This is like you get this and it's really the perfect storm in terms of its horrific nature. You see this guy who's nonchalantly got his knee on this man's neck for eight minutes and 38 seconds. Just just there's no there's there's no justification. It's very clear. It's horrific. There's no justification.
*  There's no blurriness. There's no gray area. It's just dirty. It's awful. It's evil. And then the man dies and everybody is for a fantastic reason upset and they want change and they're marching through the streets. But then when you see these bricks and then we see the chaos and there's they've caught cops cops that people knew were cops wearing police office police police distributed gas masks like official gas masks.
*  Like the ones that the cops use like the same wardrobe that cops wear. Everything's black all military issue shit. Yeah. And then these people would chase them. Are you a fucking cop like this guy's breaking windows at Target. And then someone in the comments is like I know who that is. That guy is a cop. And they were they were calling out the guy's name. So this cop is going around while these peaceful protests are going on. And he's smashing windows with a gas mask on fully dressed in military issued garb and people like well that's a
*  Canadian provocateur. But is he acting on his own. Yes. You're a rogue cop. He's like is he like one of those crazy firefighters that lights buildings on fire so they can save them. Right. Is he inciting this. What is going on here. It's a I think some people just wish they want it to turn into something. Oh yeah. Massive. And they want it to be like a civil war. And and there's also like the whole race war thing that you know you hear about in a white supremacist system like that talk about you know.
*  And there's then there's like the right way. The thing is like your mind can swim in all kinds of like conspiratorial ways and it's probably it's a mixture of all kinds of things. You know it's definitely like it's probably like hey I'm going to do this or like hey we should do that or someone kind of kids around and someone's listening you know in the police police department or whatever. And they're like yeah what if we were doing that. Whatever. And they hear that. They're like I am going to do that. Who knows. But that's some dangerous shit. And I think that that's amazing that the protesters who are seeing this are detaining these
*  people because those people they're just not helping in any way. And I'm here. Here's a good one. See this asshole is smashing things and this guy comes over and grabs him and fucking body slams him. Yeah. And then everybody holds a guy down there screaming and yelling at him. Yeah. They hold this guy. Yeah.
*  Yeah. These are Antifa. Yeah. He's trying really hard to cover his face. Yeah. It's like no no no no no. Fuck you. What is he hitting with a hammer. What was he hitting. He was making bricks off the sidewalk. Oh and that's so. Yeah yeah yeah good. Oh my god. How old is that dude. I don't know. Very frail. I mean I think they took him down. There's definitely some anarchists that are like you know they're basically they're like we're doing this. This is our time. And you know that there's like a whole wave of
*  those people because I mean I remember going to Brandenburg Germany a friend of mine out there has like a bunch of kind of Antifa slash Arnic anarchists but like kind of mellow version German mellow version of them bought a bunch of land that was actually got like a weird shaky history but it's like go bulls training camp for the Nazi youth.
*  And then it was before that it was like a Polish I don't know like Air Force place or something like that. Anyways it has like this military weird shaky history but they bought it and they've converted it and now it's like very accepting of all people like all kinds of people live on there and then they are people who work on the what's it called the fusion festival which is one of the biggest festivals in the world in Germany that's in Brandenburg and it's an amazing place.
*  It's an amazing festival it's all just love based techno you know but it's got that hard edge of like anti corporate. It's all DIY but it's massive it's like 70,000 people. Festival it's like Burning Man in the woods and very interesting conversations that you hear from them but they're in German.
*  I don't I don't I mean a tiny bit ambition but not not not a lot I actually was trying to learn German I love the German language.
*  Do they speak English?
*  Yeah they speak English.
*  So when you have these conversations.
*  Yes yeah we're speaking English yeah yeah yeah I remember once because I was renting an Audi R8 V10 plus and I drove it onto the grounds when they were tearing down and this young woman came up with a spray paint can and was like shaking the can and going like what are you doing here with this kind of a vehicle.
*  And it was this weird tense standoff but I was with one of the people who's like one of the heads she was going to spray paint your car.
*  Oh yeah yeah yeah and and and a bold lady I know and in a way like I was like you know what if she would have done it.
*  That's fine I was in her territory you know.
*  Fuck that.
*  I mean I mean I'm I'm okay with like when it comes to like people who are that passionate about like anti corporate and stuff like that I'm like I get it.
*  Yeah but that's your property.
*  No I mean I'm renting.
*  I'm renting it.
*  Yeah but she doesn't know that.
*  She doesn't know that but that but I did and I had a feeling she wasn't but there but inside my head I was like what if she did and I'd be like well I guess I just have to drive this Audi with like this fascist anti-fascist whatever symbol on the on the side of the car which I don't you know it's like it's a funny thing like.
*  No good ever comes out of that that's the problem.
*  No.
*  No good ever comes out of defacing property.
*  There's no no no compromise gets reached.
*  No conversation gets breached.
*  No no and that when you're destroying not when you're destroying history and you're destroying it's just destruction again as an initial response understandable if something happens and people go out and they're young especially in this in this climate you know being kooked up no jobs.
*  What do you want to do.
*  Let's let's rally behind this.
*  This is ridiculous whatever boom initial like ah who knows what's going to happen in that chaos when everybody goes outside.
*  I get that.
*  The continuation of it that as the standard behavior that's that's a problem that any leader any civil leader is going to condemn and frown upon because at the at the end of the day I'm a pragmatist and it's just inefficient.
*  It's just very inefficient and it's a funny way to look at it inefficient.
*  It's like how are you going to use that energy like harness the energy for real if you want real change you got to like you got to figure you have to strategize.
*  And for me I'm about hacking like we got to hack this system.
*  Yeah but you're this guy who's like really into engineering you're very thoughtful.
*  That's not what you're dealing with with these burn it to the ground motherfuckers.
*  These people don't have a plan B and they don't have no forward strategy.
*  They just want to we're going to fucking tear down capitalism.
*  And then what how are you going to get your food you fuck.
*  I'm going to get your shoes.
*  Who's making your shoes.
*  Where did you get your car you fucking idiot.
*  I know where's your phone come from.
*  I'll give you a hint not America.
*  Yes I know.
*  Things have to get made dumb dumb.
*  It's it's engineer them.
*  It is really like it is and I I agree with that 100 percent using capitalism to fight capitalism.
*  Yes they're using the Internet and social media sites on cell phones that they bought.
*  Yes yes.
*  I mean without a doubt.
*  I mean here's the thing.
*  This is what's so weird about it is that it's such a paradox right.
*  I mean essentially is what you're describing.
*  Yeah.
*  So like if you want to affect change you're either going to fit into the feedback loop
*  you're going to feedback into the feedback loop or you're going to figure out a way to
*  shift it so that you're able to spiral away from it.
*  And that's really what we need.
*  And I like people taking responsibility for getting rid of the fuckwits that are that
*  are like fucking it up for everybody because guaranteed whether it's the police or whether
*  it's protesters it's always a very very small part of the problem.
*  It's always a very very small percentage of those people are going to fuck it up because
*  also the news loves sensationalism.
*  So we're going to focus on that.
*  I think this is what we're dealing with right now is really the perfect storm.
*  OK.
*  You have a bunch of pieces in place.
*  First of all there's a lot of people that never really recovered from the 2008 crisis
*  right.
*  As people are very upset that the bankers and these subprime mortgage loans and the
*  housing crisis and everything went chaotic.
*  People lost shit tons of money and then all of a sudden you have this pandemic and the
*  pandemic comes along and people cannot work.
*  So for the first time ever through no fault of your own you literally can't work for months
*  and months at a time.
*  There's a staggering number of people right now that are in desperate states.
*  They're in a terrible position financially.
*  They're about to lose their home.
*  They're about to lose their car.
*  They're about they don't know what the fuck they're going to do to feed themselves.
*  And then you get this murder.
*  And the murder just lights all this dry wood.
*  And then everybody says look these people are all full of shit.
*  Donald Trump's full of shit.
*  Nancy Pelosi's full of shit.
*  They're all monsters.
*  It's all both Gavin Newsom's full of shit.
*  Let's fucking burn it down.
*  Let's steal.
*  Let's smash.
*  And that's taking apart that's that's that's happening.
*  While these peaceful protests are happening all the while people just got done watching
*  The Joker.
*  So The Joker.
*  Yes.
*  Which is this fucking billion dollar movie where this guy kills everybody and burns it
*  to the ground shoots people on TV.
*  And here's the problem.
*  You kind of cheer for him.
*  You kind of cheer for him.
*  Of course.
*  If this is a movie and a bunch of people were like look we're going to fucking end this
*  corrupt system of capitalism start smashing windows and burning things.
*  Part of you would be going hmm let's see how this turns out.
*  Yeah.
*  How is this going to turn out.
*  This is kind of an interesting choice.
*  Like wow these guys are getting radical.
*  Do they have a plan.
*  But then if the movie in the movie like if you saw these pallets of bricks just mysteriously
*  appearing at these areas where people are scheduled to protest and where these these
*  marches are supposed to go by.
*  You're like hey what is the fuck is going on here.
*  Yeah.
*  It's it's there's something else at play that's like trying to like push it over into that
*  fantasy world.
*  Or into that fantasy to move from the fantasy into the reality.
*  And my left wing friends think it's right wing people that are agent provocateurs that
*  are trying to start this sort of chaotic scene so that the military can be called in which
*  is what essentially Trump apparently did today.
*  Oh yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Apparently with Jamie what.
*  Why is everybody saying that it's martial law.
*  Is that something that happened after his speech.
*  During his speech he was essentially saying that if they didn't call in the National Guard
*  he's going to bring in the military.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is I don't think I don't know if he can do that.
*  I don't think he can do that.
*  That statement I think is what they're taking as martial law.
*  Yeah.
*  Essentially.
*  Yeah.
*  Which in a weird way it goes against I mean like you know you're talking about left wing
*  people saying like it's the right wing and I'm sure that there are right wing people
*  that are like saying it's the left wing because they want it to make it.
*  Yeah.
*  They think it's Antifa.
*  So it's like all this finger pointing whoever's doing it is definitely winning for their
*  point of view because they're like well we're doing it no one knows who it is and we're
*  just doing it.
*  Well Asian provocateurs have been used from the beginning of time.
*  I mean they've always done that.
*  Hitler burned the Reichstag.
*  He did that to incite the people of Germany to get behind him and that he was going to
*  take control of the situation.
*  Nero burned Rome.
*  Same way.
*  I mean it was all done in order to get people excited about this idea of this one person
*  saving them from this attack and that has been done forever.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember I had a great video called 9-11 the road to tyranny.
*  It was the first time I really understood that Asian provocateurs are a government strategy
*  and he detailed like very this is like I guess it was like 2001 or 2002 that he put this
*  video out and he detailed how the World Trade Organization when those people were protesting
*  against the WTO.
*  Yeah.
*  And this was in Seattle.
*  Yeah it was there.
*  Okay.
*  So when you were this was you were there in 2000.
*  I was there just before it blew up.
*  It was I actually don't know it was 2000.
*  It was early 2000s.
*  Early 2000s maybe 2000 2001 or something.
*  So these people were protesting against the WTO and then these guys dressed exactly like
*  that guy I was talking about earlier all black face covered military issue outfits military
*  issue Vibram sold shoes all dressed uniformly started smashing windows smashing cars pushing
*  over like post office boxes lighting things on fire and then they wound up shutting down
*  all the protests and even had they had a no protest zone where people were showing up
*  at work where they had a WTO stick or like a WTO pin with a red line through it.
*  They made them take that pin off of their jacket before they went through the line because
*  you couldn't have anything that was anything any sort of a protest.
*  It was crazy.
*  This is all documented in this film.
*  Then they eventually all these guys who were the agent provocateurs holed up in a building
*  and then the police negotiated with them and then released them.
*  So there was some sort of an order order from higher up and they were all released.
*  Interesting.
*  They use these guys they used military people for some branch of the government who knows
*  what the fuck they were who they were.
*  They used them to turn a peaceful protest about a legitimate concern these people have
*  about the doings of the World Trade Organization and they turned it into a violent encounter
*  that they could then justifiably bring in the police and shut everything down.
*  Makes sense.
*  That's what people are worried about with these bricks.
*  They're worried about these bricks these bricks.
*  This is horse shit.
*  This is done to shut down the peaceful protest where people are legitimately and righteously
*  concerned about ending police brutality because it's been going on forever.
*  It's been going on too long.
*  Yeah I mean yeah I mean I just at this point it's like I don't I don't put past any measure
*  done by people that want to maintain their bottom line like they'll do whatever it takes
*  and it's like again you know when it when it comes to stuff like that I'm like I want
*  to stay informed.
*  I want to turn those I want to keep those ideas in mind in the most simplistic way which
*  is if you've got a lot of shit you're gonna do whatever it takes to keep your shit right
*  and you'll do all kinds of crazy shit to try to maintain power and control and and vice
*  versa and what really sucks is that if you did the opposite if you did what that sheriff
*  did you you actually get not only get what you want but you get more.
*  Yeah and that's what I don't understand the virus of doing evil badly.
*  That's what I think of it as being very inefficient and terrible at being selfish and greedy.
*  If you were really selfish and if you're really good greedy you would make sure that the well-being
*  of your population was met so that there was reverence for your position and if there's
*  reverence for your position then you have the goodwill of people it's easier to make
*  things happen.
*  However people don't get that.
*  That's 5D chess.
*  Yeah man I mean I mean come on it's like no but you know people don't think like that
*  right.
*  I know they don't.
*  It's like the type of person who wants to be in that position is the type of person
*  that just wants control and power they want people to be afraid of them like the way even
*  the way Trump talks about it you know he talks about using dogs he's talking about using
*  the most vicious dogs like he says it's such a foolish he's got such a foolish way of communicating
*  in times of crisis and that's what's really dangerous because some people are really good
*  like Obama was very good in times of crisis.
*  Even George W. George W. gave a speech after 9-11 that made everybody love him.
*  Everybody was like this is our guy he's going to take care of us but I don't I don't agree
*  with him on certain political issues but obviously there's clearly evil in the world we just
*  saw these people take down the world trade centers and people have died and we're being
*  attacked okay this guy he's going to take care of us.
*  And you don't get that feeling with Trump at all.
*  No Trump is like I mean it's like he's just in his own feedback loop so whatever he can
*  do to make himself feel good he's going to do it and then he only understands caveman
*  principles which is power strength show strength dominance but he doesn't believe it himself.
*  That's the thing it's like I know you know that Trump for as much bolstering as he does
*  all of this shit that he says I swear to God if he was in a room with someone who's just
*  like you're talking about this tough guy stuff let's go right now.
*  He would be cowering in a corner there's no he can't back up any of the stuff all
*  of his positions it's just it's just hot air.
*  That would be a great episode of Black Mirror.
*  Oh my God yeah I know right.
*  That would be a great it would have to be like a guy who's like a guy who he's insulted
*  but that's like unassuming who fucks him up you know who it would have to be it would
*  have to be Justin Trudeau because he's like Justin Trudeau is like the civil social justice
*  warrior guy and he's a handsome fellow with a beautiful thick head of hair.
*  Yeah if all of a sudden Trump wakes up and he's in like MMA shorts.
*  Yes.
*  With his big man boobs.
*  Yeah totally and they're putting in like they're putting in the mouth guard and they're like
*  okay so this is what you're gonna do.
*  He's like where am I where am I?
*  Justin Trudeau is like just like massaging.
*  Trudeau is stretching and warming up.
*  Doing these crazy kicks.
*  Starts fucking him up.
*  No better yet it would be a woman.
*  Oh that would be amazing.
*  Some badass woman who fucks him up.
*  Some woman president of like Nigeria or some shit.
*  Totally.
*  Starts kicking his ass.
*  Oh my God and making fun of him while she's fighting him.
*  I mean that's the thing it's like you know I think we it would just be good to have that.
*  Imagine if that was the rule.
*  Oh man.
*  Like if you had to fight someone like if you wanted your government to fight how about better
*  yet we break it down to one versus one and the best controlled situation where we're
*  gonna lose the least amount of life.
*  You challenge to a duel the other person from the other country.
*  I'm so down with that.
*  I remember there was a science fiction story I think maybe in the 80s or it was like in
*  the 80s or the 70s and it was about that.
*  It was like in the future world leaders would just fight each other.
*  So he'd have a real problem with Putin.
*  He'd fuck everybody up.
*  Oh like because he'd be the master cheater.
*  Well he knows how to fight.
*  He's a black belt judo.
*  Oh is he?
*  A legit black belt.
*  Yeah he's very good.
*  All right.
*  You ever seen videos of him?
*  No.
*  Yeah see if you can find videos of Putin doing judo.
*  He's very good.
*  He trains with legit guys too.
*  Okay.
*  It seems like they kind of let him throw them around a little bit.
*  A little seagull.
*  Very seagull like.
*  But when you look at his movements he's clearly skilled.
*  He's very skilled.
*  There's no doubt about it.
*  He absolutely knows what he's doing.
*  Here he goes.
*  See this is him working out with the Russian judo team.
*  Like that kind of shit.
*  That guy that was a little weird the way he felt.
*  No no no man.
*  That was a legit move.
*  That's a legit move.
*  It seems so effortless.
*  It's just a simple sweep.
*  What they're doing right now is they're grabbing.
*  He's got a little fucking problem with his little thumb.
*  They're grabbing each other's.
*  They're just going to tape his thumb up.
*  They're grabbing each other's geese and they're moving each other around.
*  They try to redirect like that.
*  Okay that looked legit.
*  The other one just felt a little weird.
*  It looks weird because it's funny how easy it is for someone to throw you to the ground
*  if they just sweep out your foot.
*  You like the little high step warm up?
*  It does look quite feminine.
*  It's actually a good way to warm up.
*  My dad was a judo.
*  He's a brown belt in judo.
*  Well when I watch him maneuver there's no doubt about it.
*  He's skilled.
*  Yeah no I mean obviously he trains.
*  Yeah he would fuck Trump up.
*  We'd have a real problem.
*  Yeah we would have.
*  We'd all be speaking Russian.
*  I mean Trump would probably get taken out with like one slap.
*  An open handed slap to his face and he would probably start crying.
*  Well I don't know about that.
*  You'd have to slap around.
*  You'd probably mess his hair up and he'd panic.
*  Just get it wet.
*  Throw a bucket of water on his hair and be like AHHHHH.
*  NO.
*  So he's working out with the real Russian judo team though.
*  And he's like fucking 60 something years old.
*  That's pretty cool.
*  Just kind of crazy.
*  I mean on a human I need to accomplish something level that's good.
*  I was asked today that Maria Bamford had a questionnaire, 25 questions that you're supposed
*  to answer for a certain column or something like that.
*  And one of the questions was like did you learn something from someone that you didn't
*  like?
*  And in a way like in that video it's like well I don't like Putin but it shows that
*  you know what?
*  60 years old you can still train with the best of him.
*  He's putting himself out there and he's going for it.
*  Sort of.
*  But again it's hard to imagine that those guys weren't kind of like taking it easy.
*  Yeah I think that they were taking it easy because I mean how could you not?
*  Could you imagine being the guy that takes him on his head and you wind up dead.
*  Yeah and then you'd just be like he'd be like alright yeah you got me.
*  Seems all friendly at first and then like a week later you're like in a gulag.
*  Yeah you just slowly get poisoned to death over months.
*  Did you ever hear the story about him with Robert Kraft with the Super Bowl ring?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Sergel Simpson actually told me the story.
*  It's a crazy story.
*  Uh uh.
*  Yeah he was with Robert Kraft when Robert Kraft was there.
*  He had a Super Bowl ring on and he said let me see your ring.
*  Let me hold.
*  He puts, he takes the ring and he puts it on his finger and then just walks away.
*  And then Robert Kraft is like hey what the fuck?
*  And then you know the security guards put their hand on Kraft like shake his hand like
*  no.
*  Like that's his ring now.
*  Wow.
*  He just in front of everybody took his fucking ring.
*  Look here it is right here you can see it.
*  Like he puts it on his finger.
*  He puts it on his finger he looks at it he's like oh.
*  And then Kraft tries to get it back he's like no that's mine I'm gonna keep that.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  He just walked away.
*  Yeah.
*  Ugh what an asshole.
*  He just took his fucking Super Bowl ring but he put it on and just walked away.
*  What an asshole.
*  But weird.
*  I mean it's a power move.
*  Such a big dick move.
*  It's yeah it's totally like hey check this out.
*  He just whipped his hog out in front of everybody.
*  The thing that sucks about it.
*  What did it say that?
*  What is that quote right there?
*  I took the ring showed to Putin he put it on and he goes I can kill someone with this
*  ring.
*  And that was it?
*  That's all he said?
*  And then he took it.
*  Yeah.
*  He took my hand out he put it in his pocket three KGB guys got around him and walked out.
*  That sucks man.
*  That's weird.
*  That just sucks.
*  It's such a crazy thing to do in front of everybody.
*  I mean I get it.
*  It's like that's like you know that's like the thing like you know people like Bolsonaro
*  or Bolsonaro or Trump or any of these like kind of strong arm you know they think that
*  that's the way that you do it.
*  Because when you don't have creativity and you don't have a connection to empathy you
*  make up for it in other ways.
*  And so in this particular case it's like well I'm just going to do strong arm shit because
*  I can.
*  And do it in front of everybody.
*  And do it in front of everybody.
*  The camera is flashing.
*  Because that's how you do it.
*  I take the ring.
*  It's like this is the way.
*  I will kill some people with this ring.
*  Yeah this is the way you do it.
*  You do it.
*  This is power.
*  Eventually it's him going like this is how power works.
*  What a crazy thing to say to a guy I could kill someone with this ring.
*  I wonder if he did.
*  I wonder if he killed somebody with it.
*  You know he's definitely killed people.
*  Oh for sure.
*  I wonder if he ever killed somebody with that Robert Kraft Super Bowl ring.
*  Oh man.
*  I yeah.
*  I mean that guy.
*  God damn it.
*  I just I so hate it.
*  I just wish I just hope that humanity we can pull out of it man.
*  I hope that we can like go you know what.
*  Look what he's saying.
*  Mr. Kraft is saying now is weird.
*  Dmitry Peskov said I was standing 20 centimeters away from him and Mr. Putin and saw and heard
*  how Mr. Kraft gave this ring as a gift.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Insane.
*  Insane.
*  That's like a gift.
*  You know once that guy once the KGB guy was like no it's like you know it's over.
*  Yeah.
*  You know that it's over.
*  You're not getting your shit back.
*  He said it's a it's a humorous anecdote that Kraft retells for laughs.
*  He loves that the ring is in the Kremlin and as he stated back in 2005 he continues to
*  have a great respect for Russia and the leadership of President Putin.
*  Oh my lord says Stacey James a spokesman for the Kraft Group.
*  I don't trust dudes who are named Stacey because they're real.
*  They're real.
*  What about Keach Stacey Keach.
*  Yeah but he was born in the 40s.
*  Things were different back then.
*  You could have a gay old time.
*  Things were different for Stacey.
*  Yeah you could have a gay old time.
*  Charlie Sheen.
*  There was rumors that Charlie Sheen bought the ring but the actor denied it.
*  Oh.
*  Oh okay.
*  It's just a story about lost rings from celebrities.
*  Charlie Sheen was a big 9-11 truther.
*  He even wrote an open letter to Obama demanding that they come clean about what really happened
*  during 9-11.
*  Yeah.
*  He was one of them.
*  He was an inside job guys.
*  Man it just goes to show you like ugh yeah celebrity man.
*  Like I swear to god it's like the platform.
*  Is it a documentary?
*  He's in a movie with Whoopi Goldberg called 9-11 that came out a couple years ago.
*  What?
*  A couple years ago?
*  2017.
*  Hold the fuck up.
*  Whoopi Goldberg?
*  What?
*  I'm gonna have to watch the trailer live.
*  Oh so this is a movie about recreation.
*  Oh here I am in the tower doing coke.
*  Look at Whoopi.
*  Where did this come out?
*  What is this nonsense?
*  What?
*  This is a 3 year old movie?
*  There's Lewis Guzman.
*  Oh gee let me check my watch.
*  Oh he's looking at his watch.
*  Oh my god September 11th it's about to go down.
*  Oh Jesus.
*  Oh this looks like maybe the worst movie of all time.
*  First of all what did they do to Whoopi's hair?
*  No they took her dreadlocks and they stuffed him in the most unimaginable wig.
*  It must be like yeah she's like recreating a role.
*  Somebody that is insane to me.
*  What's crazy about Charlie is Charlie Sheen and Look at Whoopi with her big crazy hair.
*  Charlie at one point in time was a super legit actor.
*  Like in Platoon.
*  He was in some fantastic movies.
*  He was in Hotshots.
*  I don't know if that was as good.
*  Major League.
*  Pretty good.
*  Hotshots and hotshots part durr man.
*  I mean come on.
*  Not bad.
*  But I mean now we kind of all agree that he's just a fucking loon.
*  He's like a crazy person now.
*  I don't you know it's so.
*  Oh the elevator is falling.
*  Oh they're all falling.
*  Oh shit.
*  Oh they're fucked.
*  Ohhhh.
*  Damn.
*  Oh boy.
*  9-11.
*  9-11 Carrera 4S.
*  Join us.
*  September 8th.
*  Oh Jesus.
*  Just so you could hear about it before the 11th comes around.
*  You get worked up.
*  We should have a viewing party for that movie and smoke a pound of weed.
*  Oh hell yeah.
*  And watch that.
*  Invite that.
*  Invite me to that.
*  I wonder did you think do you think.
*  Do you think 9-11 like when 9-11 happened that Porsche had to rebrand.
*  What did they do?
*  They didn't give a fuck.
*  They didn't give a fuck.
*  They were very German.
*  Sorry.
*  Sorry.
*  But Arcav was named very earlier.
*  So Arcav's been named this since 1960 something.
*  So yeah.
*  No Man's Land.
*  He had a movie about Porsche's.
*  Yeah it's coming up too.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Who was the other dude?
*  The other dude.
*  Yeah he was like an 80s dude.
*  Yes he was one of them 80s guys.
*  He might have been in The Wraith.
*  He probably made a ton of money and now he lives on a ranch somewhere in Wyoming or some
*  shit.
*  That's so crazy.
*  But that No Man's Land is about DB Sweeney is a cop and Charlie Sheen is a Porsche thief
*  and he only steals Porsche's.
*  They say what about Ferrari who's like Italian trash.
*  Oh my lord.
*  He won't steal Italian trash.
*  A snobby car thief.
*  And it's a weird time for Porsche's too because they kind of sucked.
*  It's like they're stealing those 80s Porsche's that will kill you because the tires sucked.
*  And you know like 944.
*  Well no they're not.
*  They're all 911's.
*  But like those old 911 turbos.
*  Like they have that lift throttle oversteer.
*  You never drove an old one.
*  No never.
*  I have one out there that has a little bit of it.
*  I have a 964.
*  It's an RS America but it's pretty grippy and it's got really good tires and an upgraded
*  suspension.
*  There it is.
*  There's the movie.
*  But those old ones.
*  He's obviously on the trailer.
*  When you're going around a corner you have to stay on the gas.
*  Oh.
*  You can't let off the gas if you go around the corner or they get something called lift
*  throttle oversteer.
*  So as you lift off the throttle the car will oversteer and many a dude lost their lives
*  because the ass end kicked out because they didn't know how to drive these cars correctly.
*  Oh man.
*  If you know how to drive the car correctly you can actually manage that oversteer.
*  There's something about those old cars that once you learn how to drive them and I'm by
*  no means an expert in how to drive those old cars but there's something about that sliding
*  that you know how to time.
*  So you know how to time that slide and actually get you into these corners better.
*  You kind of manipulate that weight.
*  It's like a light form of drifting.
*  Yeah yeah yeah.
*  It's like inertial management.
*  Yeah yeah.
*  I never learned how to do it but I experienced that in my 964 going around a corner you let
*  off the gas.
*  It's like hey fag.
*  Oh my god.
*  It gets all sloppy.
*  Yeah it's just like your fucking your controls like.
*  It's like hey.
*  It all fucking fucks off on you.
*  You start doing a spongebob.
*  It's like.
*  It's a boy guys.
*  It just gets real.
*  It just feels like you don't have it anymore and you're like oh my god am I crash.
*  And then you like re-correct.
*  Like if you ever like have a BMW a 2005 E46 M3.
*  It's a great car.
*  It's not the fastest car in the world but it's really really balanced.
*  What is it three series?
*  Five series.
*  Three series.
*  M3.
*  It's an M3.
*  It's a great year but it's like a really it's a very mechanical car like when you're shifting
*  it everything you feel really connected to the car.
*  When you go around a corner with this if the ass end kicks out you correct real easy.
*  It feels like you're you got it.
*  You're in control of this car.
*  You just let off the gas right and it comes back in.
*  But you also you could feel like what's going on like you feel when it slips away a little
*  bit you feel very in control of it.
*  Yeah.
*  If you took it around a racetrack and you started sliding and drifting a little bit
*  you'd have it really quickly.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a shitload of look up M3 E46 drift.
*  There's like porn like drift porn all over YouTube of guys taking these cars and going
*  they're like famously well balanced.
*  But it's it's just a really well engineered well balanced car but it's front engine.
*  You know it's it's built different.
*  That rear end Porsche like especially the look at these guys.
*  They take these things look how these guys like going sideways around these corners.
*  So many people love these cars for that very reason.
*  There's this one crazy video of this guy on a loading dock and it's not very wide but
*  this guy is drifting sideways and spinning around on this loading dock.
*  Look how well this guy's handling this.
*  But this is about this car.
*  These cars are that's not.
*  Oh my Lord.
*  But these cars are like really easy to maneuver.
*  They're so controlled.
*  Easy drifters.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just an amazing car.
*  That's that's a beautiful E46 right there.
*  Well that's.
*  These cars you can when they spin when the ass and spins you just correct and you can
*  you can handle it and use it to drift around cones like this guy's doing.
*  Man I have you seen hyperdrive on Netflix.
*  No what is that.
*  It's like a drifting competition.
*  But they they like set up this course on an old like abandoned factory.
*  Oh wow.
*  And and it's right.
*  It kind of reminds me of what's that inside.
*  No it's all outside.
*  It's like that big outside like machinery kind of like you know towers everything.
*  And they have these drivers from all over the world.
*  Germany Japan.
*  It's like Cannonball Run.
*  Remember Cannonball Run from the 80s the movie.
*  So there's like all these like racers there's a husband wife German team.
*  They each drive their own car.
*  There's a bunch of couple guys from Japan a bunch of Brazil arrows some guys from Brazil
*  Americans this woman from Florida who I follow on Instagram who's badass.
*  She had a really amazing run.
*  Women men people of not a lot of people of color but like definitely like a pretty diverse
*  crew from all over the world.
*  Fuck they're going up this giant ramp.
*  They have to balance.
*  So you have to keep going back and forth until you find the balance point.
*  Then it turns green.
*  Once it turns green then you can go forward on the course and almost everybody lost it.
*  But all these people there they're so sick.
*  Some of the best drivers in the world.
*  But the thing that really brought a tear to my eye was that they're all rooting for each
*  other like all of them are rooting for each other because there's never been a thing like
*  it.
*  And I mean there's definitely drift competitions but there's never been a thing like this.
*  And executive Bruce is sure he's the wrong.
*  Yeah yeah.
*  What is she.
*  But I think she's just I think she's just in it.
*  She's a drift freak.
*  Yes.
*  Max.
*  Yeah.
*  Remember Mad Max.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm sure someone approached her about it and she like cars enough to like you know
*  be and put her name onto it.
*  But it's watch this thing.
*  You'll love it.
*  I think it's the best driving precision driving I've ever seen.
*  I have a boner.
*  It's it's it's so it's so good.
*  And they're like killing it.
*  And the thing is they can't repair their cars.
*  So I mean they can patch them up between runs but they can't modify them.
*  They can't bring in like new parts and like so what about tires.
*  The rules tires.
*  I think tires between between the different courses you can change stuff.
*  I think like during the race like and then there's like another race right after that.
*  Like I think you can do some patch up stuff.
*  There's like this French dude.
*  He had a car that just would not fucking die.
*  What was it.
*  It just want to.
*  I think it was a French car.
*  I think it was a I think it might have been a Renault.
*  I don't know if it was Renault might have been a Citroen.
*  I don't know.
*  It was some it was one of those.
*  It was like I said that I was on a date with you.
*  I was a girl.
*  I'd be very excited.
*  Would you like to take a ride in my PX 19 Citroen.
*  He probably reads.
*  Yeah it's like that.
*  But he probably watches movies with reading.
*  Yeah.
*  To read the words.
*  I can subtitle and see the imagery at the same time.
*  That's crazy.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  Let's go have some wine in a park six feet away from each other.
*  Do they have a specific kind of car that dominates these things?
*  Is it like smaller sports cars?
*  Do they use muscle cars at all?
*  It's everything like the kind of the favorite Brazil guy.
*  There were two Brazil racers actually a really young guy who was like his he and his father
*  have this amazing relationship and he's super regimented and strict about his training and
*  stuff like that.
*  And then this other dude who's his friend that that the that he taught the younger guy
*  how to drift.
*  So it's interesting they know each other and they're competing against each other.
*  But the guy the older guy wears this cowboy hat and he got he wrecked his car and didn't
*  have enough money to build a new car for drifting like years and years ago.
*  So it was like a big deal for him to like put a car together.
*  But it's like I forget what it is but it's a monster American car.
*  It's like it's oh it's right there.
*  That might be a Dodge Charger.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a Charger.
*  You don't know what the fuck that is.
*  I was going to say that.
*  How dare you.
*  I just don't remember.
*  Yes.
*  It's got the road.
*  This guy should have a road runner on the side.
*  That's a dope car.
*  Jeff Tweedy.
*  Yeah.
*  Well they put a crazy fin on the back of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well he I guess that's probably he's a monster.
*  Yeah.
*  It is functional.
*  And that car and so you're talking about going through shipping containers.
*  It's a big car.
*  With three inches of room on either side and he was bombing them and like didn't lose his
*  rear view mirror his side view mirrors.
*  Really.
*  Yeah.
*  There's like that thing.
*  There's shit.
*  I swear you're going to like there's going to definitely be some tears shed because some
*  of the shit that people pull off on this race and it's anybody's race because sometimes
*  like you know I forget the woman from Florida but you know she killed it on one of her runs
*  and I was like oh my gosh she's going to go really really far and then she just had
*  a car problem.
*  They had problems with like a pressurized hose system that's supposed to hit the car
*  if you don't clear a certain thing.
*  This guy's fucking drifting on the snowy road in a 68 charger.
*  Oh my God.
*  Look at all the snow and ice.
*  This is so unpredictable.
*  Yeah.
*  This guy's a monster.
*  I want to just grab him and hug him and say cut that wing off.
*  Yeah I know.
*  Cut that disgusting wing.
*  Oh.
*  He drifted his way into a tunnel.
*  Bonus drift.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's so dangerous.
*  You're going to lose your mind over that show because I can't wait for the second season
*  Bro if you're going to talk drifting you got to talk Ken Block.
*  Have you ever seen that shit that he did?
*  That Hunnigan shit that he did with that Mustang?
*  No.
*  Oh my God.
*  No.
*  Block is a monster.
*  The most insane I want to say is a 65 Mustang?
*  Somewhere in the I think it's one of the earlier generation Mustangs and it's like the most
*  ridiculously modified Mustang.
*  It's got what there it is.
*  Look at this fucking thing.
*  It might actually be a 67.
*  Ok so you're there with Matt LeBlanc.
*  Je suis Matt LeBlanc.
*  Who Trivia grew up in the same town as me.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah Newton Massachusetts.
*  Shout out to Matt.
*  I used to hear about him because he dated girls that I knew.
*  Oh man.
*  Look at that car man.
*  So Ken Block has this fucking ridiculous car like super I think it's a four wheel drive
*  car too and he's got these crazy shifters and these e-brakes and shit.
*  Yeah yeah yeah.
*  Those big ass.
*  Look at that.
*  You're going to get a kick.
*  These guys are like doing that shit but on a course that's insane.
*  There's a dude classic again cannonball run shit.
*  This white dude Lamborghini Huracan I believe.
*  Whoa.
*  Makes it four wheel drive or no it's a four wheel drive car.
*  He modifies it so that he can turn off four wheel drive so make it four wheel drive or
*  rear wheel drive for different events.
*  So his take was that he was going to tech out everything and when he went on runs he
*  had like the auto fold mirrors so he'd fold in his mirrors so he wouldn't break his mirrors
*  off and all this shit and he actually made it quite a ways but it was like the Japanese
*  team in cannonball run.
*  They had like that crazy teched out car or whatever.
*  It's man I had such a blast.
*  That's a fun looking show man.
*  It's funny you talking about Brazil.
*  Did you ever watch that documentary on Ayrton Senna?
*  Oh yes.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Amazing right?
*  Man racing spirit man.
*  Dude that documentary shows you like what fine line exists between being the very best and
*  someone who dies in a crash.
*  It's so they're riding this fucking razor edge of performance and Ayrton Senna was famous
*  for having these spectacular instincts but ultimately died in a crash.
*  Yeah I mean and unfortunately you know fortunately unfortunately unfortunately he had the crash
*  but then they changed so much you know because the racers were complaining about like how
*  dangerous it was.
*  Well he was responsible in some way for the design of the NSX.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah they had an Ayrton Senna version of the NSX that didn't have a sunroof.
*  It had a solid fixed roof and I think they did some different modifications to the suspension.
*  It's kind of crazy when you look at it you know we were talking about cars earlier before
*  we started the show and modern sports cars are so goddamn fast they have so much horsepower
*  but the NSX when it came out I think I want to say that 275 horsepower.
*  That's a lot for a tiny car that wasn't that big of a car.
*  It was slow bro trust me I had one.
*  It was slow.
*  I think I think.
*  But look that's the very first.
*  That's the Ayrton Senna version.
*  Oh wait a minute.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's.
*  Look at that.
*  I want to say this is like early 90s.
*  Well it's flip windows or flip lights so it is an earlier version of it.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah I think my mind oh no I was thinking of Acura Integra.
*  That seems like it's got a body kit.
*  That seems very modified.
*  No that's a huge body kit.
*  Are you kidding?
*  There's that second intake on the bottom and then there's the side skirts that were added
*  and it's been lowered.
*  Yeah and then the hood.
*  That's not the.
*  No that's a super ducked out.
*  Someone went crazy with that one.
*  But those Senna's.
*  Yeah those they are still you can still find them.
*  They're all red.
*  They're all red with a black black roof and you can still find them for sale.
*  They're obscenely expensive now.
*  They're fun.
*  A great little car though.
*  There's something about those cars too.
*  You feel like you're in a like a jet because the way the cockpit sits.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very purpose driven.
*  Yeah.
*  Really great car.
*  I had two of them actually.
*  Oh wow.
*  Yeah I had one with the flip up lights and then there he is.
*  What do you think of the new NSX.
*  It's great.
*  It's a great car but it's not the same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It gets a supercar with four wheel drive and a hybrid engine and it's got electric engines
*  to electric motors.
*  Yeah.
*  A gasoline engine.
*  It's spectacularly fast.
*  Yeah.
*  But the old NSX was an aluminum car that was rear wheel drive mid engine six speed.
*  Wow.
*  And it was an amazing.
*  A racer.
*  Little light car.
*  I want to say it was like twenty four hundred pounds or something really light.
*  Crazy light.
*  Yeah crazy light like aluminum.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's why with that two hundred seventy five horsepower engine you know for the time
*  it was a quick car but it was like the Japanese answer to Ferrari because Ferraris were beautiful
*  but they fucking break like crazy because my people make them.
*  You know what my people engineering they're fucking animals.
*  You know those fucking posse chaps designing your shit.
*  Maybe the way it looks but then you hand it over to a German guy or a Japanese person
*  and they know this won't do.
*  So the Japanese are like we got to do just sit down.
*  We're going to see what you're doing.
*  I see what you're doing.
*  Yeah.
*  And we're going to make one that doesn't break.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean I love those challenges back and forth.
*  I mean you know I love that.
*  I mean I saw that finally saw that Ford Ferrari movie.
*  I was glad I saw it.
*  I know they took some liberties here and there.
*  But yeah kind of a cool lesson in decisions that companies make about emotional products
*  you know and also just like you know dudes being dudes.
*  They're like well we're going to create a race program is going to derail the Italians
*  you know and then like and then them like changing their you know like the Italians
*  going like I've changed my mind.
*  I go we saw other company you know whatever.
*  The whole thing is very obviously very dramatic but it is wonderful to see what can happen
*  if people just put their heads together and go you know what we're going to fucking create
*  a sick race car right now and we're going to get an amazing team together.
*  We're going to put it together and you know and the modern GT is is gorgeous.
*  It's a car that I've wanted for a long time.
*  The modern GT especially the light version the all carbon fiber version of it.
*  And you can buy one but they're like a million dollars.
*  They're too much and you have to like go into the special thing where you have to like you
*  have to know somebody who gets you in it.
*  Well now you can get them because the two year expiration date is passed you can actually
*  get them on the resale market.
*  Oh yeah.
*  There's one for sale like a mile away from here.
*  Really.
*  Go look at it.
*  I don't know I'm happy with my car.
*  They're too expensive.
*  Yeah my car is like I'm very happy with it.
*  No you have a beautiful car.
*  It's a good and I like my Tesla too which is what I drive most of the time.
*  Do you tell people what your other car is that we're talking about or are we going to
*  keep it a mystery?
*  You say like I love my car.
*  For the first time on national TV.
*  I mean yeah we can say what it is.
*  I mean it's it's been it's kind of a car that means a lot to me because we're a weird thing.
*  My dad was a car dude and I never understood it.
*  Oh really.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah my mom like told me stories about like basically when he met her he had an Opel as
*  a kind of a cheap Opel and then he ended up buying a Pontiac Firebird that was I forget
*  what color it was but it was a I think was a type of green.
*  Anyways he had this amazing American sports car in Europe and everyone was freaking out
*  over it and he had that and then his second car was a I can't remember what what this
*  was the third car was but then his car after that was a Chrysler Cordoba which was kind
*  of just like a classy chill kind of yeah like a luxury sedan is what it was but it was a
*  still two doors so it was a luxury coupe I guess.
*  He had that and he loved cars and I just didn't put that together and then I so then when
*  I finally got my stuff together and I had enough credit thanks to my business managers
*  in Oconwood I had enough credit where this car that I have only only it cost me very
*  little money.
*  It was like five thousand dollars to get into it.
*  What.
*  Yeah.
*  How's that possible.
*  I don't know but that's on a thousand dollars down payment and then you pay per month.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like that car is not a five thousand somebody's lying to you.
*  No no no.
*  That's a five thousand dollar car.
*  Let me look at your book.
*  Someone's lying to you Reggie.
*  Joe Rogan.
*  Somebody fucked you over.
*  That is how much it costs.
*  Five thousand dollars.
*  Your managers are creepy.
*  There's cocaine in your car.
*  Well maybe but I'll take it.
*  It's a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S 992 the new one.
*  It's a dope car.
*  I'm very impressed with it.
*  This is the first time I've seen one of the new ones in person.
*  that your car is it's it's not understated but it's it is compared to like the turbo
*  s but it's like the perfect amount of sleek design but like slightly compared to a car
*  for the amount of performance that that car has under the hood.
*  Yeah.
*  Or under the bonnet I guess you would say because of the rear.
*  That's right.
*  Would they say the bonnet.
*  No I guess they would.
*  I don't know what they call it.
*  Well there is no there's no there's no back hatch for it.
*  There's a British call the front right.
*  The bonnet is the front.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  The boot is the trunk.
*  But it's not a boot.
*  But it's not a boot.
*  And you can't see it.
*  You can't see the engine on the 2 fans.
*  Yeah it's two fans.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  So you have the 4S.
*  It is a fucking beautiful car man.
*  But it's like it's so sleek.
*  Yeah.
*  Understated.
*  Yeah it's super sexy.
*  It's really weird.
*  Like sometimes I look at it and I'm like it looks pretty badass.
*  And then the other night I had it parked at night and I showed my friend we walked up
*  to it and it just looks so crazy sexy.
*  Like in a way that I'm not used to feeling about a car.
*  But it feels.
*  But it but it was built.
*  It was.
*  I do.
*  Sorry.
*  I get feels.
*  It was it was built in the town I was born in.
*  It was built in Stuttgart or sorry the Porsche is from Stuttgart.
*  I think it was actually built in another village.
*  How come some of them have the big fat single exhaust tips the two tips and then yours has
*  four tips.
*  That's the sports exhaust.
*  I kind of like the way yours looks better.
*  Yeah it's weird.
*  I thought that I ordered there's a couple things that I didn't include in the spec that
*  I thought I did.
*  So they didn't come but I'm actually glad that I didn't get them.
*  But the sports exhaust exhaust was one.
*  And I realized sports exhaust doesn't give you any performance.
*  Just makes it louder.
*  Makes it louder which I didn't really understand.
*  I thought sports exhaust it must like get rid of it must exhaust better.
*  It just makes you a more obnoxious person.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm glad because I don't want to attract attention.
*  So beautiful car man.
*  It's so well engineered man.
*  There's so many things you were telling me that it does that I didn't know like the night
*  vision shit.
*  Yeah the surround view when you're backing up that's a lifesaver.
*  I've always wanted to have that in a car.
*  And it has tech that all cars should have you know.
*  I mean the way I viewed it is like you know I wanted to drive a Porsche because everybody
*  who drives Porsche always says the same thing.
*  It's the benchmark.
*  It's like it's a driver's car.
*  It's a bit you know.
*  Why do you have to say it like that bro?
*  Well because that's what it sounded like in the beginning to me because I was like okay
*  okay okay.
*  Settle down asshole.
*  It's like everyone going like game of thrones you've got to see game of thrones which is
*  still I still I haven't seen it.
*  I will not see it.
*  I'm not going to see it.
*  We're not going to talk about anything else.
*  Oh damn it no no.
*  It's the greatest show in the history of the world.
*  Sure okay.
*  How dare you.
*  I know I'm sorry I'm so sorry.
*  I'll get to it for you.
*  I'll do it.
*  Please thank you.
*  But but your people were right about the Porsche.
*  But they were right as soon as I because I purposefully didn't I never rented one I never
*  drove one and I never drove one until I had one.
*  And as soon as I took my first drive is like me and my assistant because my assistant has
*  been with me for like 12 years and and she helped me you know with all this big leap.
*  So you just buy it.
*  You didn't even test drive.
*  I didn't test drive it because when people speak enough about this you know Porsche Porsche
*  Porsche Porsche Porsche they're not lying like they're not there.
*  No one's making that shit up.
*  And so and I should talk to someone who's really into Scientology.
*  You might be wrong.
*  There's a lot of people that are in this shit that's nonsense.
*  But this is not a nonsense car.
*  That's a masterful piece of engineering.
*  Yeah it's I mean I drove from Montana down to L.A. and I thought it was going to be uncomfortable.
*  You know it's like that's a sports car.
*  It's going to be uncomfortable because I had an Audi TTRS before this and that had the
*  track suspension and that was an unforgiving suspension.
*  Everywhere you went you're like you know you're just getting thrown all over the place.
*  Yeah.
*  And this this car is so civilized and when you're on the road you're like I can do anything
*  but I'm just going to chill like like for me I just kind of set my cruise control.
*  That's the other thing it has adaptive cruise control which is a very very important thing
*  when it comes to any car really but a sports car especially and I didn't have in the TTRS.
*  So if you're in bumper to bumper traffic you're just pedaling back and forth pedaling back
*  and forth and it sucks.
*  But with the Porsche I just set it you know and just cruise and it had lane keep assist.
*  You have a Tesla.
*  I have a Tesla yeah.
*  But doesn't your Tesla do that too.
*  Well Tesla does autopilot which is a whole other leg.
*  That's my favorite.
*  That's my absolute favorite.
*  I love autopilot.
*  When I come home from the comedy store and it's late at night that is the move.
*  Yes.
*  I just love it.
*  I'm a little tired.
*  I feel like driving.
*  I just put a couple fingers on that thing and kind of pay attention.
*  I pay attention but yeah.
*  Get it going.
*  Just do do do do.
*  Just let it just let it take over.
*  It's so sweet.
*  It really really.
*  I mean I've been using autopilot for probably 70 percent of my drives for since it came
*  out and there's some new upgrade that I got but I haven't done anything to it.
*  There's some new upgrade like full autopilot.
*  Yeah.
*  I did that too.
*  Yeah it's not really doing a lot right now yet.
*  It's starting to recognize traffic lights so you will get a warning when a traffic light
*  is turning yellow to red.
*  There'll be that.
*  That's the beginning of that and then there's a couple other things like stop sign like
*  physical stop sign.
*  It can read oh there's a stop sign.
*  Things like that but nothing is automated.
*  Those are not automated.
*  They're only recognition things.
*  So right now it's recognizing things that it could be active in but it's not doing it.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  I love I love autopilot.
*  I mean I will say with the Porsche that's my last gas car that I'm going to get.
*  I just wanted to like experience it and know what it's about and then and then I'm going
*  to probably move on to I don't know something or maybe I'll just you know something will
*  happen in the world will completely change and they'll have no access to my resources
*  and I'll just go back to just gardening.
*  But yeah man you might have to get an axe.
*  Yeah I'll have to get an axe.
*  Start a fire with two sticks.
*  Yeah.
*  You know but I grew up a boy a boy scout.
*  I'm ready man.
*  You know it's like that.
*  What is that Einstein quote.
*  I don't know what weapons they're going to use in World War 3 but World War 4 we fought
*  with sticks.
*  Oh I love that.
*  It's beautiful.
*  That's totally true.
*  I mean we're going to see man.
*  We're going to see.
*  I hope fighting this with rocks.
*  Yeah I know.
*  Yeah with provided rocks.
*  It's like are they they're trying to corporate anyways.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm not going to go back there.
*  I'm so confused.
*  All I know is I'm going to do my best to promote peace and love peace and love and understanding
*  and education education education.
*  This is the perfect storm with all these people out of work.
*  You know like that.
*  I think that was ultimately extremely irresponsible to to just shut the economy down for as long
*  as they did.
*  I think it's a terrible idea.
*  I think it creates unrest.
*  When you see unrest in all these these countries you're not seeing it in rich communities.
*  You're not seeing people in Calabasas like lashing out.
*  It's not a Beverly Hills thing.
*  It's the things that happen when people don't have anything.
*  Well you've you've greatly increased the amount of people that are fucked and then you've
*  thrown this horrific circumstance where we all get to watch a video of someone being
*  murdered by a cop while these other cops sit around and watch.
*  And then this is all compounded by all these videos.
*  There's a video that I tweeted where this fucking guy is at a stoplight and these Denver
*  cops are shooting his car with pepper gas.
*  And he's like hey man my fucking pregnant girlfriends in this car.
*  Are you fucking guys really shooting.
*  I'm like I'm not a criminal.
*  And so they keep shooting it.
*  They shoot it in his car more.
*  So as he's sitting there in his car they're shooting pepper canisters whatever the fuck
*  they have.
*  Yeah.
*  Shooting pepper spray at his fucking car.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you doing?
*  What are you doing?
*  There's so many videos of these cops doing horrible shit during this time.
*  And they know that they're being filmed which is really crazy to me.
*  They think they're protected because they're wearing riot gear and no one could recognize
*  them.
*  Look at this.
*  So these guys are standing there.
*  Give me a volume on this so you can hear this fucking guy.
*  Can you hear it?
*  Yeah.
*  Are you fucking pregnant?
*  Are you?
*  Shoot it!
*  Fuck you!
*  You shot a car with a pregnant woman in it!
*  With fucking tear gas!
*  Fuck you!
*  It ain't going nowhere!
*  Fuck you bitches!
*  Shoot it again!
*  Shoot it again!
*  He's fucking pregnant!
*  Shoot it again!
*  Look they're shooting tear gas at his car.
*  Why?
*  With a pregnant woman in the car.
*  First of all, you're being a fucking moron.
*  Because this pregnant woman's in the car and you're asking them to shoot tear gas at you.
*  I know, I know.
*  He's definitely exacerbating it.
*  But at the same time, they should be not doing that at all.
*  At all.
*  Because there's no reason.
*  This is not like this guy's a threat to humanity.
*  He's not a threat.
*  He's just impassioned and he's loud and he's saying stuff.
*  And it's like they've got all the gear.
*  They have to show the restraint.
*  They're having fun shooting at a car with a pregnant woman inside of it.
*  Just the fact that they knew that there's a pregnant woman inside of it.
*  It's just insane to me.
*  Someone should have gone over there, liked that fucking sheriff from Flint, talked to
*  him, apologized.
*  And then keep the car moving.
*  The problem is, my friend Tim Kennedy was tweeting this.
*  He's a ranger, special forces guy.
*  And he used to fight in the UFC.
*  And he tweeted, there needs to be some sort of a fundamental change in how we train law
*  enforcement.
*  Exactly.
*  And I think the way they train, if you go through BUDS, if you become a Navy SEAL, you
*  have to be exceptional.
*  You have to be an exceptional human being to get through that.
*  And that's the way they weed out the people that can't cut it.
*  That's how they do it.
*  But they don't do that for the cops.
*  For the cops, it's far easier.
*  And you're around civilian life.
*  You're around cities and urban areas.
*  And you're dealing with constant conflict.
*  And so you don't weed out the people.
*  You actually actively recruit people.
*  I remember driving down Sunset Boulevard and talking about the great, great pay that you
*  could get being a Los Angeles police officer, because nobody wanted to be a cop in LA.
*  They're fucking advertising.
*  Like, hey, why don't you work at Chipotle?
*  Hey, why don't you be a cop and get shot at?
*  Like, it's fucking crazy.
*  Like it's just like, it's in the same line as like, you know, working at the farmers
*  market.
*  You can also be a police officer.
*  Yeah.
*  And look, there are great cops, man.
*  They're great cops.
*  There's great people out there.
*  But it's a hard job and it is not for everybody.
*  It's a hard job.
*  It's not for everybody.
*  And they just need to do a better job of training and weeding out.
*  They really, really need to do.
*  And they need to make it.
*  They need to make their officers accountable and not be afraid to like, oh, you know, so
*  and so's blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  It's like, oh, no, that's a snitch or whatever.
*  Or we're going to fucking demote you or we're going to put you on traffic duty or whatever.
*  It's like that shit needs to stop.
*  It's like take your job seriously, man.
*  And it's existed across the board.
*  It's been there forever.
*  Did you ever see the documentary, the seven five?
*  No.
*  It's a documentary about corrupt cops in New York.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  The guy who was the head guy in the seven five that we had on the podcast.
*  Mike Dowd.
*  Yeah, Mike Dowd.
*  Mike Dowd, who's a great guy, who's a real piece of shit back in the day, right, but
*  owns it and talks about it.
*  I mean, he was driving a Corvette and selling drugs and helping.
*  But I mean, like shit that you wouldn't believe it was in a movie and it was all real.
*  And the film documents all of it.
*  It is madness.
*  I mean, top to bottom, beginning to end madness.
*  Well, you watch the documentary, you watch at the end, you're fucking sweating and you're
*  like, holy shit.
*  Like these guys were living like this, selling coke, robbing drug dealers, coming out of
*  there with bags of cash like crazy.
*  Oh, my God.
*  I mean, yes, I know cops.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  And I talked to my friend Scotty, Scotty Reitz, or back in the day, he was just like saying
*  like I was in SWAT in 70s in L.A. and we were part of the first League of SWAT.
*  And he's like the shit that people would do that he would see in the department all the
*  time and what they had to deal with.
*  And then there were all like those purges that happened throughout the years, you know,
*  once in a while there'd be this corruption thing and then they would just have to fucking
*  like go.
*  How about the rampart unit?
*  Right.
*  Didn't they disband that?
*  Oh, what was the rampart unit?
*  That was the people that they suspected someone from the rampart unit of killing Biggie.
*  They think that they.
*  Yeah, there was a crazy Rolling Stone article about that.
*  Someone paid him off.
*  They suggested it was Suge Knight that was involved.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yes.
*  Crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you know, the police department needs to police itself.
*  The ultimate police corruption documentary is Cocaine Cowboys.
*  Have you seen that?
*  Oh, I've heard of that.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  Cocaine Cowboys and Cocaine Cowboys 2 are probably in my top 10 of all time favorite
*  documentaries.
*  I've had Billy Corbin, the director of it on the podcast several times.
*  He also made Screwball, that recent documentary on A-Rod.
*  It's all about steroids.
*  Oh, I didn't know that.
*  It's genius because he used little kids to play A-Rod and all the other people.
*  What?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  In the movie and as a recreation.
*  Oh, my gosh.
*  He used little kids.
*  It's a genius movie.
*  Oh, my gosh.
*  Screwball.
*  Yeah, it's a genius movie.
*  Billy's a brilliant, brilliant guy.
*  He's one of those rare, really intelligent, proud Floridians.
*  I got you.
*  Really intelligent guy who loves Miami.
*  He's like a he's a paradox.
*  That's a very rare breed.
*  Very rare breed.
*  But Cocaine Cowboys 1 and 2 are so goddamn good and so crazy.
*  There was one year in the 80s that the entire graduating class in the police academy was
*  either murdered or went to jail for corruption.
*  The entire graduating class, they were all on the take.
*  Everyone was selling and doing coke.
*  Man, it is a fucking amazing documentary.
*  That's so insane to me.
*  Of course.
*  I mean, of course, of course, of course.
*  Of course.
*  I mean, they just there was so much coke and so much money coming in and they were just
*  all on the take.
*  Everybody was on the take and everybody was doing committing crimes and helping people
*  commit crimes and hiding millions of dollars in holes in the ground in their backyard.
*  They think to this day, there's a bunch of dead people that died with millions and millions
*  of dollars in their backyard just buried in holes.
*  Oh, my Lord.
*  What a crazy.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Any other?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, there were so many banks in Miami, too.
*  That's the other thing.
*  Like, why are so many banks here?
*  Because they're all fucking funneling cocaine money.
*  There's more.
*  They were more.
*  At least at the time, there were more banks per capita in Miami than any other city in
*  the country because they were all just funneling cocaine money and laundering it.
*  My gosh.
*  I mean, come on.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's that absolute power thing, right?
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, again, it comes back to the same thing.
*  First of all, the oversight.
*  You can't really oversee that many people correctly.
*  You literally have to be like a one on one oversight to police officer.
*  Follow them everywhere.
*  Right.
*  And that's deeply embedded.
*  The corruption was.
*  And I think, again, just look, I was a security guard for one year when I was 19 years old.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I worked at Great Woods, Great Woods in Mansfield, Massachusetts.
*  It's like a concert center.
*  And all these guys from my TAC window team got jobs working security there.
*  So that's how I got the job.
*  They were like, hey, you want to work?
*  It's easy.
*  Just come out there.
*  And I'm like, what do you have to do?
*  Most of it is stopping people from bringing in booze and keeping people from doing certain
*  shit.
*  First day I got there, this dude named Alley Cat.
*  Alley Cat was the head security guy.
*  He ran the joint.
*  And they caught this kid, this drunk kid stealing a golf cart because everyone would drive around
*  the concert area in golf carts, security guys would.
*  So this drunk kid stole this golf cart.
*  They tackled him.
*  And I watched him beat the fuck out of this dude with a walkie talkie.
*  I beat this dude in the head with a walkie talkie.
*  This is my first day on the job.
*  So I was like, well, what did I get myself into?
*  Because this seems like we're going to be beating people up.
*  And within a couple of weeks of this job, we had all developed this us versus them mentality.
*  It was very strange.
*  It's like it was us versus them.
*  It was like we were cops.
*  And it was like I saw guys who I knew that were like really nice guys, like being really
*  shitty to patrons, to these people that came to see these concerts because they had just
*  sort of developed this attitude.
*  And I wound up quitting because of a Neil Young concert.
*  There's a Neil Young concert and fires broke out.
*  These because, you know, Neil Young fans are all dirtbags.
*  Sorry, folks.
*  But at the time, in the 1980s in Boston, there's like there's a lot of fucking druggies and
*  people that were into Neil Young that were like in to get fucked up, man.
*  And so these guys had started fires on the lawn area.
*  So what would the way great food, great woods is great woods is an amphitheater.
*  So there's an there's an enclosed area and then there's a back area.
*  This is a cheap seats.
*  It's a lawn and the lawn area.
*  These dudes just started fires because it's probably getting cold out.
*  And they shut the concert down.
*  So they had to clear out the concert.
*  It was madness and chaos.
*  And then brawl started happening.
*  People started fighting.
*  And then I knew that I was probably going to come to a situation like I'm a very survival
*  first type of dude.
*  So I brought a hoodie with me and I knew that when the shit goes down, I would throw this
*  hoodie over my fucking security outfit.
*  I'm out of here.
*  Yeah.
*  And I just quit on the job.
*  Never got my last paycheck.
*  I just fucking I just zipped up for you, man.
*  I'm like, I'm not getting any fights and no one's stabbing me.
*  No one's hitting me.
*  I'm getting the fuck out of here.
*  Yeah.
*  And I drove home that night and I'm like, well, that was an experience.
*  I did a few months as a fake cop.
*  And I but I but you understand.
*  I remember very clearly that even I was developing, I was mad at people for not listening to me.
*  Like I was like, hey, man, I told you, park your fucking car on the other side of the
*  line.
*  Like that kind of thing.
*  I'm like, why am I talking to this guy like this?
*  Yeah, it become.
*  I was 19.
*  I was a moron.
*  But there's a thing that happens when you have the power and you have control.
*  And there's a bunch of other guys with you.
*  You know, so I have this team of goons that were with me.
*  Right.
*  And then this gang.
*  And then there's these people that don't want to listen, you know, and I'm like, hey, I
*  fucking told you to pick that up and put it over there.
*  And then you realize like, oh, we're the cops.
*  We're the bad guys.
*  Or we're the, you know, yeah, right.
*  The ones in control party poopers.
*  It's a thing that happens when you have control.
*  That's a very, very, very, very, very minor control.
*  I mean, they could have told me to fuck off and I wouldn't.
*  I probably would have done anything.
*  Yes.
*  I didn't have a gun.
*  I didn't have a weapon.
*  Yeah, I never beat anybody up there.
*  There was no real thing.
*  Right.
*  But there was an attitude in this attitude.
*  I remember thinking while this is going on, like, oh, this is what happens.
*  And then imagine this times 100.
*  And you can imagine what a cop is.
*  But we had clearly because there had been, you know, you're dealing with drunks and you're
*  sober.
*  There were times where there was assholes and we had clearly a divided line between
*  them and us.
*  Right.
*  Yes.
*  That's that's the danger, man.
*  Yeah, that's so hard.
*  And it's hard when it's in a complex situation like urban environments, you know, where you're
*  like there's city streets, tall buildings, compact areas, tiny, tiny streets, winding
*  or whatever.
*  You know, it's different than being like a cop in like from my hometown in Great Falls.
*  Like you're just cruising around a cruiser and you can see pretty clearly in every direction.
*  It's laid out like a grid.
*  This call comes in.
*  Someone stole a chicken.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're just like, oh, well, better go check.
*  That's probably that's probably all Hank Swenson, if I'm not mistaken.
*  That chicken stealing son of a gun.
*  Oh, God, you know, or it's a meth, you know, some meth kid that's like standing in the
*  middle of traffic or something like that or something like that.
*  But it's just totally different rules.
*  And not only that, but everything is so it's so it's so hard to like feel like you can
*  communicate with police officers.
*  There's never a time when I get pulled over and I know police officers, but I get pulled
*  over.
*  I'm just immediately terrified.
*  And also because I'm a black man.
*  So like my immediate thing is like, OK, so keep the hands on my wheel.
*  Windows are rolled down all the way.
*  My license is already I'm not reaching for anything when they're approaching.
*  I'm like thinking about all of that stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Which which sucks because I'm sure some officers, if they knew that that's the way I felt, they
*  would hate that.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're like, I'm just stopping you because this or whatever.
*  I don't want to be that person.
*  I know that for those officers that feel that way, it's going to be tough, but they really
*  need to like they need to be the ones that are the majority or at least that are made
*  known to be the majority.
*  And then from the cops perspective, anyone you pull over could be the guy that shoots
*  you.
*  Of course.
*  Anyone you get over could be some guy who's out on a warrant.
*  And you know, you don't know if you're ever going to see your family again.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's a giant percentage of them that are dealing with just crippling PTSD.
*  Yeah, there's there's definitely PTSD.
*  And there's also a lack of communication to civilians to be able to also pre pre de escalate,
*  you know, because so many videos that I watch those dash cam footages of people saying like,
*  you know, a cop coming up to the window and saying license and registration and their
*  immediate thing is what what are you pulling me over for?
*  And then the cop is like, can I just have your license and registration?
*  And then they keep doing that, whether they have the legal right, which I believe that
*  you actually do have the legal right to ask for why you're being pulled over.
*  Why take the risk?
*  Yeah.
*  You know, the cop just wants to get the information and do their job and whether they can do that
*  or not.
*  If you have it on camera, you've got on camera, their conduct is on there anyways.
*  So you know, and then what I tell everybody, it's like, just survive.
*  That's that's that's that's what you need to do.
*  And that goes for anybody, whether you're white, black, woman, whatever.
*  It's like in general, like the attitude is like, survive this, make the officer feel
*  safe and survive it.
*  You're not going to arbitrate it in that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Be be polite.
*  Be respectful.
*  Yeah.
*  Get it over with.
*  And you still could run into the wrong cop.
*  Oh, you can still run into the wrong cop.
*  There's no doubt about it.
*  No doubt about it.
*  But it's hard, you know, but you have to hold the line.
*  That's it.
*  It's harder when everything's against you and when everyone's expecting you to do the
*  wrong thing.
*  One thing that's a positive trend and this is not something that you know, it's not something
*  that people really even want to discuss after someone gets murdered by the cops.
*  There's been a distinct drop in people being killed by cops since 2015, particularly in
*  black men being killed by cops.
*  There is a drop.
*  I think I think it's one of those things where whenever something like this happens, that's
*  a catalyst for change.
*  It's almost like we need.
*  First of all, how ironic is it that Colin Kaepernick takes all that shit for kneeling
*  at the Super Bowl.
*  I know.
*  And this fucking guy kneels on this guy's neck and proves the point.
*  Yeah.
*  Kills the guy by doing the very thing that Colin Kaepernick was criticized for.
*  Going down on one knee and doing it to a black guy and killing him.
*  Yeah.
*  Kind of fucking crazy.
*  Because it's sort of symbolic about like, look, this is what they were talking about.
*  This is the thing.
*  It's right here in front of your face.
*  Now you see it.
*  Now you get it.
*  Yep.
*  I know.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, somebody should just sign him.
*  Okay, we fucked up.
*  Come on back.
*  Oh, no, please.
*  Please come back.
*  Yeah, come play.
*  I mean, it's tough, man.
*  I mean, you got to protect your bottom line.
*  You know, it's like when there's a corporation involved, it's tough for people to speak out.
*  They didn't want anybody being the guy who gets attention from protesting.
*  They're like, this is a bad precedent to set.
*  I don't know anything about football.
*  So I don't know what his skill level was, whether or not he would.
*  I mean, those guys get pushed in and out anyway.
*  Like the number of years that a guy can play, the average number of years that a guy can
*  play professionally in the NFL.
*  I think it's like two.
*  Yeah, two or three years.
*  Yeah, it's crazy because it's so brutal.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, fresh, young, hungry guys are coming up out of college every fucking day.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's like, you know, and it's the same thing with Facebook and Zuckerberg and his
*  like, you know, his continued position of like, well, we've got to balance things.
*  It's like it all it just comes off like the reaction to Kaepernick or Facebook's reluctance
*  to do anything or even like Facebook's reluctance to do anything about what?
*  Well, Zuckerberg, you know, is basically saying like, we're not we're not here to edit anything.
*  And I'm not saying that I'm for editing, but it's OK if you have a if you have if you're
*  in charge of a company, you're the face of the company.
*  So what you do is a reflection of what you believe in.
*  Right.
*  So in his particular case, he must actually believe this, but he just believes that to
*  say nothing, to do nothing about the things that are posted, which is which you know,
*  you can argue in court all day.
*  Does it incite violence or is it just someone being free expressing their free speech or
*  you know, whatever the deal is?
*  But if someone's consistently hitting a certain angle and the response is pretty palpable
*  and fairly measurable and yet you choose to just allow it to be what it is because, you
*  know, people figure it out.
*  They'll educate themselves, that type of a thing.
*  You have to take some kind of a position from a humanitarian point of view.
*  And I think that I'm very disappointed in in social media in general because because
*  they're trying to protect their bottom line.
*  And that's really what it comes off as.
*  It doesn't come off as like, well, I want to protect free speech.
*  If it to me comes across more like we need to protect our bottom line, because if we
*  if we start editing something, then it's going to be a huge landslide.
*  Everyone's going to be like, oh, well, screw this.
*  Screw these guys for a stifling free speech and all of that stuff.
*  When in actuality, it's it only the only reason why you would make decisions like that
*  are really just to protect the bottom line.
*  I don't really understand any other because you I mean, even Apple takes a position, you
*  know, like Tim Cook will issue a letter that's then able to be circulated and you can read
*  the letter and like, oh, OK, that's interesting.
*  They don't believe in this and they don't believe in this as a company.
*  Zuckerberg is more like, well, I believe in in whatever the greater bland
*  generalization is for my operating system.
*  Well, first of all, if we want to talk difference between Apple and Facebook, these
*  differences are gigantic.
*  Apple is a technology company.
*  They are not a social media platform.
*  The difference between the responsibility of a technology company and the responsibility
*  of a social media platform is enormous.
*  It's a new year. The consequences are enormous.
*  Apple makes phones and computers and they have an app store and, you know, they they
*  take down bad apps and, you know, things that they find that are spying on people and
*  the like. But they don't really have the same dilemmas that someone like Facebook has
*  when you talk about the importance of free speech, when as soon as you decide, OK, this
*  person can't talk, but this person can.
*  What you're essentially saying is my viewpoint is better than the viewpoint of the
*  person that I disagree with.
*  Now, if you have very specific things like you can't dox people, you can't threaten
*  people, you can't say anything racist or sexist or homophobic or once you establish
*  those parameters, you know, if you decide that this is how you're going to operate,
*  if this is your company, there's a real good argument that you should be allowed to do
*  that because it's your company.
*  But then when it gets, when the company gets big enough where it's like Facebook or
*  Twitter, then you get a real argument like, oh, the best argument for bad speech, the
*  best antidote is more speech.
*  It's better speech. So someone says something that's wrong.
*  There's a real education value in being being able to correct that and having other
*  people correct it, like just eliminating it in some ways strengthens the resolve of
*  the people that hold that marginalized idea, whether it's racism or sexism or whatever.
*  When you just eliminate it, then they go off and it tends to strengthen their their
*  resolve. Sure.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Sure.
*  And then particularly when it comes to things like right wing issues or left wing
*  issues, if you're if you're running there's no right wing social media site that's as
*  popular as the left wing ones.
*  But if there was and they just decided we're not going to tolerate any trans stuff,
*  we're not going to if you started talking about how a man who has a sex change is now
*  a woman, we're going to tell you to fuck yourself.
*  That's not real. We're not going to tolerate abortion.
*  You want to talk about abortion, right?
*  You're killing babies. Get the fuck off our platform.
*  That's the kind of shit that right wing zealots would do to people that hold left wing
*  ideology. But conversely, you do see that from people who are left wing zealots, who
*  are angry about people who have right wing ideas and maybe even not so right wing like
*  Megan. I'm sorry if you've heard this before.
*  I use this example all the time if you're listening.
*  Megan Murphy, who is a what you would call a trans exclusion exclusionary radical
*  feminist, they call her a turf.
*  And what that means is she's a person that's a feminist that doesn't believe that you can
*  just change your sex and then you can have these arguments and deal with women's issues
*  like a trans person she believes is different than a woman and a feminist.
*  And there was some sort of a debate she was having online with someone on Twitter.
*  And she said, but a man is never a woman.
*  And so they told her she has to take that down.
*  And so she on Twitter.
*  OK, so she takes it down and then she makes a screenshot of it and post that.
*  And so they ban her for life, for life, for saying a man is never a woman.
*  Look, it's one thing if you're shitting on someone and you're you're mad at someone,
*  you're saying a man is never a woman.
*  But if you want to just talk biology, a man is never a woman.
*  So if you're a person who is a left wing progressive zealot and you don't want anybody
*  that's not adhering or complying at all to the to the ideology of progressive people,
*  you ban someone like that.
*  And so I don't. Yeah. You know, I'm saying this is the problem with censorship.
*  It's like, where do you draw the line?
*  My opinion in that case is you let that woman say that you let people correct her
*  and you let people correct the people to correct her.
*  And you you you get a lively debate where people get to discuss
*  whether or not they are different things.
*  And I think there's a real valid intellectual argument in that.
*  There's a valid social argument in that.
*  But this is the problem with censorship.
*  Well, you know, and my thing is like, I'm not exactly I'm not saying I'm not saying
*  to censor, I'm just saying weighing in on the conversation.
*  So how do you do that?
*  Well, you take responsibility for it.
*  It's like it's what specifically are we talking about?
*  Well, I'm just saying, like, for instance, if I look at my comments,
*  so say I post something on Twitter and there's all these comments or whatever,
*  like a lot of my friends who have Twitter accounts, they may
*  they may read the comment and be like, oh, that guy's an asshole or whatever
*  and never say anything.
*  And there's just like all of these, you know, comments that are some of just troll
*  people just trying to get reactions and stuff like that. All that. All that.
*  I like to personally engage all of that shit.
*  And I like to come at them with a conversation.
*  And the thing that ends up happening with something like Facebook is because it's
*  I'm just I guess I'm biased because I don't think I don't think very much
*  of Zuckerberg at all. And he's
*  just kind of a little bit of a thief or a lot of bit of a thief.
*  He's a thief and he's not he's not an innovator in any way.
*  He's running a company.
*  But when you say a thief, well, because he stole the ideas.
*  You know, I have some people that were
*  going to school with him around that time period.
*  And he just basically stole the initial code for Facebook,
*  which was generated by a few different people and just kind of made off with it.
*  And he's just like, you know, it's like it's like how all many companies are formed.
*  It's like someone had an idea.
*  There's no way for them to protect the idea because someone capitalized on the idea.
*  How come most people can't sue him?
*  I don't know. I don't know. I think it's because it's arbitrary.
*  I think it's like where that came from, where the original code came from
*  and so forth is arbitrary. So they must be furious.
*  I know that they're furious, you know, and I know that they're furious.
*  And I know some other people from startups that also addressed it.
*  No, of course, he's not going to address it.
*  I mean, he may maybe maybe he did. I don't know.
*  I'm not an expert on it.
*  All I know is that in the beginning, there was that.
*  And then in parallel, as it was growing and as they were making decisions,
*  I would hear from people that are in his orbit
*  that would kind of describe his decision making process processes and so forth.
*  And I don't get a sense that he he understands.
*  His his responsibility, his social responsibility
*  or his responsibility to the identity of the company seems very far removed.
*  And his actions kind of dictate that it's like a little bit laissez faire
*  in a sense that if if I have like going back to my comments,
*  I'm commenting on those things because I'm letting I'm letting people comment.
*  But I'm engaging in a conversation with them in hopes that we can talk.
*  Open to anybody being able to comment back to you.
*  Oh, yeah. Say whatever they want.
*  Yes, of course. Yeah.
*  But do you know the what is the explanation that YouTube did for this?
*  But this is the problem with banning comments or deleting comments.
*  It gets that stuff can get coopted.
*  And there was a situation recently where YouTube was caught
*  deleting comments that were critical of the Chinese Communist Party.
*  And what they said was that it was a software glitch.
*  Oh, yeah. No, that's them protecting their bottom line.
*  100 percent. Right. Yeah. That's what I would imagine.
*  Totally. But I saw that.
*  I said, OK, that's what I'm talking about.
*  Like that kind of shit.
*  Like once someone comes in and says, hey, we would really like it
*  if you remove those things to talk about, you know, some of the mean stuff
*  that we do here. Yeah.
*  And we're willing to do business with you.
*  But we want you to put filters up. Yes.
*  So they said it was a software glitch.
*  I don't know how that software glitch is.
*  It actually works out in the target of the Chinese Communist Party. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's that's my problem.
*  I mean, I don't have it. I'm not saying get rid of stuff.
*  I'm just saying be more accountable as the face of a company.
*  So what would you like him to do differently?
*  Well, I know you don't like them, but.
*  So is it just Facebook or do you have this problem with YouTube?
*  Do you have this problem with Twitter?
*  I mean, here's my problem.
*  Whenever you whenever power is consolidated
*  and there's there are always going to be problems
*  because there's because there's going to be all these different ways
*  that people wish that it were and it's not working for them in this way
*  and so forth.
*  My thing is the future is distributed.
*  It's a distributed network, distributed social networks.
*  I have my own app, WhatsApp that I created.
*  Oh, what's that? It's just an app.
*  It's a yeah.
*  WhatsApp. It's only on iOS.
*  We can look for it. Do it.
*  It just has it has exclusive content.
*  I created a bunch of like interviews with Jack White and
*  and Leslie Feist and Fred Armisen are on there in this stupid series.
*  I call drone versus the shot entirely on drones.
*  And you can't really hear the conversation because the drones are too loud.
*  Really? Yeah, it's really stupid.
*  But yeah, check out WhatsApp.
*  It's out there. But it's got live streaming.
*  I have a store that I sell all my old electronics on.
*  But, you know, I have other artists that are interested in making an app,
*  but apps are notoriously the cost prohibitive.
*  I mean, it's over 100,000 to create an app. Right.
*  So I managed to get my app made for a really, really cheap price.
*  A brilliant guy named Oliver Klein, Oliver Thomas Klein,
*  designed single handedly the whole app.
*  It was amazing. And his aesthetic is awesome.
*  But my thing was if I can create a template and keep getting the price down
*  to make an app and they're just using the template that I created
*  for other artists and other bands,
*  then we can have a distributed network of apps that can inter communicate
*  with one another without the need of Facebook, Instagram, any of these
*  these social media platforms.
*  And that way, when a fan comes to visit my site, they know it's my shit.
*  It's not being tracked. No one's getting tracked.
*  There's no social for my for my app.
*  There's no there's no social component to it.
*  People can't comment on anything.
*  There's just content to observe, events to behold
*  and electronics and headphones to be bought.
*  And that's it. So when you go there, it feels like a safe space.
*  And so if there's an interconnected network of distributed apps,
*  which essentially are just kind of interactive websites, I guess.
*  That's what an app is.
*  Ultimately, now you've got something that's distributed.
*  Fans can kind of trust that it's a safe space.
*  It's not owned by Facebook.
*  It's not owned by any of these corporations.
*  So for me, it's about power consolidation.
*  It's never going to be what you want it to be.
*  It'll be convenient and it'll be ever present.
*  Like Google, for whatever reason, Google, I have a better opinion of than Facebook.
*  And mainly, I will say also the other big factor with Facebook to me
*  is the aesthetics are a piece of shit.
*  It's a it's a confusing, terribly designed piece of shit.
*  It also encourages verbose dialogue.
*  It encourage you could write as long as you want.
*  Yeah.
*  But these fucking long ramblings.
*  Oh, yeah. People. Yes.
*  It I know. I know.
*  I haven't even seen a Facebook.
*  I haven't done Facebook in like nine years and eight years, nine years.
*  And whenever I even get a get a glimpse of it, my anxiety shoots through
*  through the roof because the design is so terrible.
*  It is such a shittily designed website filled with ads.
*  It's terrible.
*  And I'll say the only good thing about Facebook is Oculus.
*  And they didn't even they didn't come up with that.
*  They just bought it.
*  Yeah. Instagram was cool.
*  It's kind of still holding it down a little bit.
*  They own it, though, but they didn't they didn't create it.
*  Yeah. They haven't done.
*  What have they done to it? They've done anything different.
*  They made it. Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah. They made ads.
*  Now there's ads everywhere. That's true.
*  And now there's they're tracking everything.
*  The timeline is not chronological.
*  It's algorithmical. That's weird.
*  That's really weird.
*  So they're basically used to be chronological.
*  Used to be chronological, which it should always be chronological.
*  But they fucked with it.
*  So isn't that an option, though, where you could view it chronologically?
*  I don't think so.
*  No, I can't find a way to change it.
*  Everyone. Everyone argues about it.
*  It's it's just terrible design.
*  But that's all we got. Right.
*  We got Twitter.
*  We got Instagram.
*  And then we've got some TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese company.
*  Which is like, I don't want the government won't let you put that on your phone.
*  Oh, yeah. Military. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Because it's owned by a Chinese company, which I have no problem with Chinese people.
*  But the Chinese government.
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, super creepy.
*  Yeah. Well, there's this guy that I follow.
*  Let me find his thing on YouTube.
*  He's an Internet privacy guy.
*  Yeah, I've gotten really deep into this lately.
*  Let me find out. I've got a bunch of subscriptions here.
*  I have to figure out what my fucking subscriptions are.
*  But he's too many. I have way too many.
*  I have too many. His this Internet privacy guy.
*  He sells these things on his website that are D Google phones.
*  So really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  God damn. Where do you find your subscriptions on your on your
*  your app? Oh, let's see.
*  Fuck is it?
*  Oh, there it is.
*  Your channel, your membership, your data settings.
*  Do do do do do.
*  Where's my fucking subscriptions piece of shit?
*  Oh, here we go.
*  Subscribes have been subscriptions as a general search.
*  It'll it's under your ID. Oh, OK.
*  Yeah. One second.
*  Subscriptions.
*  Guys, here's all my subscriptions and my passcodes.
*  Oh, OK.
*  So here we go.
*  Where is this? No, that's I put it in there.
*  It didn't show me. Where are you finding it?
*  Oh, yeah. If you if you do, it's under Apple ID.
*  Oh, under Apple. Yeah.
*  You know, someday like that, it's a settings.
*  Yeah. So right here at the very top with your like little image,
*  just click on that. OK.
*  Hmm.
*  And then subscriptions are the fourth after payment and shipping.
*  OK.
*  Anyway, this guy has he's a huge proponent of online privacy.
*  So he sells all of these.
*  Here it is. Apple ID subscription.
*  He sells all of this is now that's not what I'm looking for.
*  I'm looking for the YouTube stuff that I subscribe to.
*  Oh, oh, YouTube app.
*  Then the other side. Yeah.
*  With to be as the Brazilians would say, you to be.
*  What do you find it does at the bottom now?
*  They've changed it. So hit library.
*  OK. And then there you can hit.
*  Or if you just hit the subscriptions button, actually, you should be able.
*  But that's going to be categorical by like most recent uploads.
*  But I see on library, I don't see I see my videos.
*  Well, they just hit the subscription downloads.
*  Where's the bottom? The bottom right in the middle.
*  Unless you're updated. There it is.
*  They keep moving it right.
*  But that's just showing me videos is not showing me channels.
*  Yeah, that's the way to start at the top.
*  Then you can search for the channels that you're subscribed through.
*  Yeah. So it's a feed.
*  Yeah. See right here.
*  There should there should be just right at the bottom.
*  It just says subscriptions. Yeah, I got that.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  But it's not showing me the channels.
*  That's oh, oh, yeah. OK.
*  Here we go. There you go. OK.
*  There you go. I'm sorry. This is fucking clunky.
*  Man, it's not your fault.
*  It's whenever that shit happens, it's bad design.
*  Oh, I subscribe to too many.
*  This could be a long, boring, boring thing.
*  But just see if you can find internet privacy guy.
*  No, that's one of them.
*  That's a phone. But the Fairphone is I think that's an unfair phone.
*  Yeah, that's one of those Linux phones.
*  What is the Fairphone three review?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Fairphone is its own channel.
*  Yeah, but that's not it. Rob Braxman.
*  That's it. Rob Braxman tech.
*  It's this gentleman who's very much into privacy.
*  He's so into privacy, I want to look at his fucking history.
*  I'm like, what are you hiding from?
*  But he's got a website and on his website,
*  he actually sells de-Googled Android phones.
*  Well, very well de-Googled Android phones.
*  So he takes these 2019 and, you know, I think that's the most recent
*  you can buy like a Motorola Android phone and they take all the Google out of it.
*  And so Google's no longer tracking you.
*  You don't have to log in with Google. Yeah. Yeah.
*  His website's whatthezuck.net.
*  Oh, nice. Stick it to the Zuck.
*  I think that's one of his websites.
*  But that's not his main website.
*  I thought it was his.
*  No, no, that is his website, but that's not his main website.
*  He's got a website, though.
*  He's got it like a like if you have a support me on Patreon, contact me.
*  VPN. I figured that was his only website there.
*  That's it? No.
*  He's got a website where he sells stuff. OK.
*  And Braxman dot something or another.
*  But he sells he's got like a F Droid.
*  He's got a VPN Wi-Fi hub.
*  So even when people use your Wi-Fi, it all goes through a VPN.
*  Oh, I love that. Yeah.
*  I love that. Find his website, though.
*  See, that's just Google.
*  That's the future. Braxman website.
*  That's totally the future.
*  It's like the future is distributed.
*  Rob Braxman Tech. It's encrypted.
*  Yeah, that's it. Brax.me. That's him.
*  Yeah. See, so he sells a bunch.
*  Look, it shows your IP address at the top.
*  How creepy is that? Oh, shit.
*  Letting you know. Oh, I see that. Hey, fucks.
*  What's the what's the website again? Brax.me.
*  Brax.me. Yeah, he's there's a see if you can.
*  Yeah, that's that's privacy focused social media.
*  And so he's got a bunch of different stuff that he sells.
*  But if he also has a store and if you go to the store.
*  Yeah, because I guess a VPN for my.
*  It's all right. We're not going to find it while we're doing this.
*  Yeah, something's wrong.
*  I don't know what what happened wrong.
*  Something has changed. Something's wrong.
*  Something is wrong.
*  He he's just talking about all the different ways in these videos
*  that he makes on YouTube, all the different ways that you're being tracked.
*  Yeah. Through your fingerprints, through your face ID,
*  through every Google search, all your location data.
*  And, you know, there's this recent thing that came up
*  where Google is being sued in Arizona because they turn location
*  services on even when you have it off.
*  Oh, well, so even when you turn location services off with Google,
*  it's still searching your location.
*  It's still reporting that data back to Google.
*  So there's a lawsuit right now about that.
*  Yeah, that's that's the problem.
*  And I mean, it's like, you know, I have this a little bit of that dumb attitude,
*  but it is an attitude where I'm like, well, I'm going to do everything
*  I can to protect myself.
*  You know, I run VPN on my phone.
*  I've got a Winston VPN, whatever thing, my browser, you know,
*  to help protect and stuff.
*  I'll do as much as I can without getting overly geeky
*  and then like paranoid about everything. Right.
*  Because ultimately, if they want to track where I'm at,
*  like they're just going to track where I'm at and whatever.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  But if I can do things like, oh, create my own app,
*  now I'll take it into my own hands.
*  And I can do as much as I work.
*  If I know hackers and programmers and coders, we can actually just start
*  creating our own version of the Internet. Right.
*  But if you want to use Instagram or you want to use Facebook,
*  like you get in track. Oh, no, for sure.
*  No, you're going to use those things, but you know, but you already know.
*  But if you're working with like programmers and hackers,
*  they know how you're being tracked.
*  So the way that you use your, you know, like, for instance,
*  every ad that I get, I always market as junk.
*  What is this, Jamie?
*  That's what you're talking about.
*  It's a product that's been around since 2011 when it was found called Geofedia.
*  Yeah.
*  Where they tap into all social media and mix it with Google data.
*  Well, sell it to whoever would like to buy it, to use it for.
*  Yeah. Well, yeah.
*  But yeah, it's capitalism going crazy.
*  Well, I mean, I guess like there's so much value in knowing.
*  Like once once Facebook started getting insanely rich just off of data.
*  Yeah. There's so much value.
*  And knowing what you're up to, knowing where you're going,
*  knowing what you're buying, knowing what you're saying.
*  Of course.
*  How many times have you been talking about something and then you find ads on your phone?
*  Every time. Guaranteed every time.
*  So creepy that I'm never going to stop being creeped out by that.
*  Oh, it's every time like I'm, you know, I remember talking to my mom.
*  It was just recently in Montana, talking to my mom and I mentioned a thing
*  maybe two or three times and we have a Google,
*  whatever home thing, you know, in the house.
*  And and I went downstairs and went to Amazon and Amazon suggested the product.
*  They're in bed with Google.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  And there's like, you know, and so my thing is like, I'll use whatever.
*  I'm not going to be so paranoid that it's going to bum me out and ruin my life.
*  But I am going to work with people that are really smart and engineers and so forth.
*  And I'm just going to create my own version of the things that I use all the time
*  with my platform.
*  Essentially, you could do the same thing if you create your own app.
*  Right. And not go the crystal, you know, which, you know,
*  God bless them.
*  All the subscription, all the junkie stuff, it's like, what is he doing on his app?
*  It's like it's a subscription based app.
*  And I was thinking about like doing something like, oh, charging for the app
*  uses that anymore.
*  And I don't think he does, but it still exists.
*  And I text him like, hey, what the fuck is this?
*  Like a couple of years ago, what did he say?
*  Do that anymore? Oh, yeah.
*  Floating around out there.
*  It is floating out, but it's still making money.
*  Is it? Oh, yeah, because you can still subscribe.
*  But he doesn't have anything on it anymore.
*  I mean, I just it was like maybe, I don't know, half a year ago, I checked it.
*  It was still active. Huh.
*  And then I deleted it.
*  But I just I just think like when you're subscribed, my thing is the future is
*  distributed. Also, I believe in a direct economy and the direct economy is like,
*  oh, you've got something. I'm going to buy it from you.
*  And that's excluding like if you're using an Internet like safety,
*  you know, payment system, whatever, like PayPal or whatever,
*  that they're going to take a small percentage of it.
*  I don't really care necessarily about that.
*  I definitely understand the engineering behind it.
*  But just like if there's something that you want to sell, then sell it directly.
*  Subscription is a weird thing.
*  I mean, subscription to me is cool if Instagram and Facebook went to a subscription
*  model so that I didn't have to see any of the fucking ads and that I was guaranteed
*  that my tracking was being limited like YouTube as YouTube read.
*  Right. Right. Right. So I have to premium. Right.
*  I never see an ad. I can't stand ads.
*  If I see an ad as well, I'm going to I'm going to murder somebody.
*  I agree with you. That would be a really smart move for them because I think they'd
*  probably generate additional revenue that way and goodwill.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very good point.
*  Yeah. Instagram, pay attention, you fuck.
*  Yeah. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck faces. Yeah.
*  Very rarely, very rarely do they suggest something to me that I'm interested in.
*  No. Or they suggest stuff that you already have.
*  Sometimes. So many times like, oh, there's that thing I already bought every now and
*  then, though, every now and then there's one of them little sponsors.
*  I know. I know.
*  Kind of a good product.
*  Well, you know what I'll do is I go to Brave, a private browser, you know, so I'll go to
*  Brave and I'll use Brave and then I'll look up the product there.
*  I use Duck Duck Go to use Duck Duck Go to the search engine sucks on it.
*  It's not as good. But you know, whatever.
*  But then I look it in your underwear.
*  That's absolutely 100 percent.
*  You're checking under your fingernails.
*  It's tough, man. It's tough being a modern human.
*  It is, but it's almost inevitable.
*  I mean, I feel like we have to accept this new reality.
*  Yes. You know, privacy is one day going to be a thing of the past and not just in terms
*  of like what you browse. And but I think what you think, you know, one thing that Elon
*  said to me in the last conversation I had that really creeped me out is like, you're
*  going to be able to talk without words because he's talking about neural link.
*  Oh, yeah. The neural link.
*  You know, talk without the number to talk and have conversations without words.
*  Oh, God damn it.
*  What are you going to do that leads to hive mind?
*  We're going to have hive mind.
*  Well, here's here's the thing.
*  My condensation or the or the condensing of technology in general, it's we are
*  fascinated with creating the things that we already do, that we already do
*  inherently. Right.
*  So that idea of like being able to talk without words, it's like that happens all
*  the time anyway. So you ever go on a dance floor and watch people like dancing
*  and like someone's like communicating and they're just body language.
*  They know what's going on or you're about to call your friend and suddenly your
*  friend calls.
*  That's why we communicating without words like on the dance floor is a perfect
*  example of like one of them portions where the ass end goes out and you're out
*  of control of it.
*  There's some communication in there too.
*  Like this guy doesn't know how to control his body.
*  Yes, exactly. Yeah.
*  It's like, oh, well, I'm going to stay away from that person.
*  Stay away.
*  Stay away.
*  This person is losing control.
*  Fucking dance over here.
*  He can't he can't dance.
*  And then, you know, but then but then there's, you know, there might be like a
*  compassionate choreographer be like, here, I'll teach you how to dance.
*  I will make I will make an example of you.
*  You know, those women aren't real.
*  No, you don't think that there's like there's benevolent choreographers that
*  will help you.
*  They steal your liver.
*  Those those girls, they drug you and steal your liver.
*  You wake up in a tub filled with ice.
*  I love that.
*  That's a story that like if that actually was a stereotype for choreographers,
*  I don't trust choreographers.
*  You know, one minute they're teaching you a bunch of routines and then the next
*  you're in a bathtub with no liver.
*  Yeah, you're making out with some Eastern block chick and all of a sudden you fall
*  asleep and you wake up and there's a deep pain on the right side of your body.
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  Oh, no.
*  Big chunk of your liver is missing.
*  No, that's not the future.
*  I'm living.
*  I, I, I, I'm shooting for the I'm shooting for the high ground, man.
*  We're going to do it.
*  Yeah, we're going to do it.
*  I don't know.
*  I have great faith for the human race.
*  I do too.
*  I mean, I think this is a terrible blip in our civilization.
*  And yeah, I think we've had terrible blips in the past and we've gotten over them.
*  The problem right now is we're our foundation is really being tested because we've
*  had multiple blips in a row.
*  Yes.
*  Big heavy ones.
*  Yep.
*  And you know, big stress test, big ones, big ones.
*  And unless we have a period of peace where we can digest these and recover,
*  yeah, we're deteriorating.
*  We just like keep taking these hits like an old boxer.
*  It's just getting knocked out.
*  Like, whoa.
*  Yep.
*  Like, yep.
*  And brain damage and tissue damage.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I mean, that's the thing.
*  It's like, you remember, you know, like I, what I'm hoping for is a, you know,
*  another age of enlightenment, you know, like Spain had one, you know, there've
*  been every, every most large cultural epicenters have had these moments where
*  things kind of came into balance after some great turmoil and we were able to
*  just put on cruise control for a little while and like explore more in-depth
*  nuanced things about who we are.
*  But those things existed before social media.
*  I think the only way we're going to be able to pull that off today is with
*  mushrooms.
*  We're going to need something that lets people know like, oh, this reality that
*  you're in is a very bland two dimensional projection of the reality that you can
*  experience.
*  Yes.
*  With our little fungus friends.
*  Yes.
*  Just a little bit of an escape from this tired realm into a land of infinite
*  possibility of love and understanding and connectedness and, and a dissolving
*  of the ego and the likes of which you've never experienced before.
*  If we could all do that, if that could be legal, look, marijuana has radically
*  changed the culture of California, radically changed the culture of Denver,
*  radically changed the culture of everywhere where it's been legalized.
*  That's true.
*  And it's changed the way people communicate with each other.
*  It's changed their ideas about law enforcement because we're no longer
*  worried about jackbooted thugs knocking down our door because we like to smoke a
*  plant that makes us happy.
*  That's not a concern anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a fundamental shift in just how we are as a human race.
*  And that's us.
*  It's a mild psychedelic.
*  Psychedelics, they come in very, you know, if marijuana is a gateway to anything,
*  it's a gateway to the real psychedelics.
*  It's a gateway to mushrooms.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's a gateway to DMT.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a gateway to mescaline and ayahuasca.
*  Yeah.
*  All those really fucking profound world dissolving ones.
*  It's a gateway to those things.
*  And I really think that we need something like that at this time.
*  We need, we need rituals, some sort of psychedelic rituals.
*  And best processed by real legitimate professionals in real established centers
*  where people actually know what they're doing.
*  We could help people get past this, this bump in our evolutionary travels.
*  Yeah.
*  And all the trauma, you got to deal with the trauma.
*  We can't, we can't, you know, we, we try to run away from it most of the time.
*  And we try to feel good about stuff and, and you just need to take it on,
*  understand it and then transform it.
*  Yeah.
*  Transform it into a part of yourself that makes you stronger.
*  And psychedelics really, they're just like a reminder.
*  It's a reminder of how we are, you know, because when children are born and their
*  eyes are flinting everywhere and they're trying to absorb as much as they can
*  about the world, they don't care about color.
*  They don't care about any of the shit that we have problems with this.
*  Yeah.
*  All that stuff is learned.
*  That initial state is essentially what happens with psychedelics.
*  We go back to the interconnectedness of consciousness and however you want to
*  define that, but the experience of it is very interconnected.
*  And it's a reminder that, oh yeah, we're part of, we're natural organisms.
*  We're part of this planet.
*  This planet is a part of a solar system.
*  The solar system is a part of blah, blah, blah.
*  And you also realize that your life experiences and your memories and even
*  your personality is basically like a tiny pop-up tent that you've set up in the
*  wilderness of real consciousness.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, I've got my little, I've got my little stove here.
*  I'm going to cook my tea and I got it all under control.
*  And then you unzip that tent and you go out into the fucking wilderness of, of
*  psychedelic consciousness.
*  You realize, oh my God, I've been living in a tent.
*  I've been living in this little baby pup tent.
*  This has been my reality.
*  Yes.
*  And the more insecure people are, the more they want to define what is allowed
*  and not allowed inside that tent.
*  Exactly.
*  A hundred percent.
*  And it's like, you know, I mean, and guaranteed I've had arguments with people.
*  I mean, I remember there was like a skinhead on a bus once and we had a
*  conversation together and he was still an active skinhead and we were sitting
*  across from each other a while, always.
*  But we kind of like, he commented on something I was wearing or something
*  like that and we started talking for a second.
*  We were talking about mutual things and then he got, he got up to get off the
*  bus and he just kind of looked at me and just kind of, and he just kind of shrugged
*  and walked off and I was like, that's interesting.
*  Basically a neo-Nazi guy was on a bus and for whatever reason we connected on this
*  one thing and it reminded me of, you know, the cartoon with the sheepdog and the,
*  and the, yeah, morning Ralph.
*  Yeah.
*  Morning Ralph.
*  It's like, that's how sometimes I like to view stuff.
*  I'm like, okay, so you're going to play the role of the person who's the fascist.
*  I'm going to play the role of the person who's, you know, afraid and hiding in the
*  shadows.
*  Okay.
*  And go and scene and action.
*  Um, and there's something about like, you know, I talked to my friends about it.
*  It's like there, there is a way if you're, if you're smart, you're intuitive and
*  you're emotionally intelligent enough, you can always find your way to that
*  person's core and you can share a value.
*  If you can share one value, you can make it, you can learn something, even if it's
*  a brief moment, just for a second, an interconnected moment with another person
*  who shares none of your values at all.
*  Do you know who Darrell Davis is?
*  No.
*  Darrell Davis is a guy, he's a brilliant guy.
*  I've had him on my podcast before.
*  He is a blues musician who has personally converted more than 200 KKK and Nazi
*  members and got them to leave.
*  And he did this.
*  He got them to leave these hate groups.
*  And he did this because he met a guy at a gig.
*  He was doing a gig and he met this guy and the guy was like, you play, you
*  know, you're a really good musician.
*  And they get to talking and he sits down with the guy and the guy says to him,
*  I'm always talking to him.
*  Well, I never had a drink with a black guy before.
*  He thought he thought the guy was joking.
*  He's like, come on, man.
*  And he's like, no, I really haven't.
*  And he goes, uh, you haven't.
*  And he goes, no, I'm in the KKK.
*  And he's like, what?
*  The guy pulls out his fucking KKK ID.
*  Yeah.
*  So Darrell gives this guy his number and says, Hey, I'm going to be in town again.
*  You know, when I'm, when I'm in town again, let's, uh, let's have a drink.
*  Let's talk.
*  So they become friends.
*  So they start talking a few months after they become friends.
*  The guy hands him his grand wizard outfit and says, I'm quitting.
*  He says, obviously I was wrong.
*  I had this idea that black people were in fear.
*  First of all, Darrell is extremely intelligent, very articulate, like,
*  and a brilliant musician and just, uh, just the way he talks, it's very clear
*  that he's smarter than you.
*  Like he's a smart guy.
*  So if you're a dumb dude, he's in the KKK and you're talking to this guy who you,
*  you've in your group, you've determined this is an inferior guy, but he's
*  obviously smarter than you.
*  So like, what the fuck?
*  And he's a really nice guy.
*  He is a nice guy.
*  So they become friends.
*  They start eating dinner together.
*  He has them over for meals and just quits.
*  He says, I'm not doing this anymore.
*  I'm not, I'm not going to be a racist anymore.
*  Hands him his outfit.
*  So Darrell brought all these outfits with him.
*  He showed me this Nazi flag.
*  This guy gave him and he's got all these different grand dragon and grand
*  wizard and all these different outfits.
*  Him personally, his one-on-one interactions has converted more than 200 people.
*  It's amazing.
*  The podcast, please, if you have the time, please find it.
*  Darrell Davis, Darrell Davis, the podcast with me and him is three hours long of
*  him just telling these stories about meeting these Nazis and meeting these KKK
*  guys and converting them.
*  That's, that's, and that's something he set out to do.
*  This is what's really crazy.
*  As a grown man, just a musician.
*  It just happened.
*  Not set out to do.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you know, it goes down to my, my, my new catchphrase is love is efficient.
*  You know, you know what I mean?
*  It does work.
*  Yeah.
*  It just works because like, once you're just like, you're not noticing the stuff
*  and you're just casually talking, you're shooting the shit with somebody and
*  you're like, oh yeah, that's cool.
*  Oh, I love, uh, you know, and then before you know it, they're just like,
*  Oh, what, what am I, what?
*  It's just, everything crosses.
*  You're like, but they shouldn't be, but I, but, but I was scared of, but I
*  thought, you know, it's like the first time you meet, like, like the first time
*  I saw, uh, like, uh, like a queen, you know, at like a drag off, you know?
*  And I was like, they're so tall and so, so boisterous, so big.
*  And I was like, I'll never be able to, you know, be able to energetically mingle
*  with someone like that and come to understanding.
*  And then I've had some of the most incredible conversations with so many
*  people of all different kinds of walks of life that I thought I didn't hate them
*  or anything. I just thought they're so different.
*  Like why would we have in common?
*  And I just realized that I just love pretty much everybody, you know, like,
*  you can find common ground with almost anybody.
*  I can find common ground with anybody.
*  As long as they're open and they're willing to find common ground with you.
*  Yes, of course.
*  Yeah. And, and it's awesome.
*  And a lot of it is just like being confident enough in yourself that you're
*  like, whatever they're doing, whatever they're projecting at me, I understand.
*  It's them projecting at me or brave enough to explore with them.
*  Brave enough to talk with them about those things.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  That's what people need to find that fucking common ground this day and age.
*  And that's one of the things with gigantic numbers of human beings, the
*  population that we're experiencing, hundreds of millions of people in this
*  country. It's hard for us to just realize the value in each individual, each
*  unique individual, you know, a hundred percent, a hundred percent.
*  I mean, it's funny when I had my car dropped off of Montana, like I didn't
*  really, you know, everyone kind of keeps themselves in Montana.
*  That's kind of a conservative, you know, place, especially Great Falls.
*  But car came out of the car trailer and my across the street neighbors came out.
*  The other neighbors, when I was a kid, I don't know if it's the same family.
*  I think it's the same family, but they were like, they would call me racist shit
*  all the time. And my mom would like get up in their face and be like, I'm going
*  to kill you if you touch my kid.
*  It's still stuff like that.
*  They're still there.
*  Oh, they're still there. Yeah.
*  I mean, they've they've changed.
*  I think they've moved on, but they've changed.
*  And, you know, and I had some early when we first moved there problems
*  with my dad, like sitting on the porch, smoking a cigarette and people going,
*  like, what's that guy doing out there?
*  You know, whatever. And then my mom's white and they're confused.
*  But but all of these neighbors came out and people came down from the street,
*  you know, and they're just like, oh, what's going on?
*  They're like looking at the car and they're like, oh, hey, can I grab a picture
*  and stuff like that? And and the thing that I noticed, it's like that was
*  the first time all my neighbors were like together on the street
*  and for this moment.
*  And then I kind of realized, well, when you have a platform
*  where people recognize what you do and all, by the way, congratulations on Spotify.
*  That's thanks. Fucking rad.
*  When I saw that, I was like, good for them to celebrate that. That's great.
*  But like when you have a platform and you could be any way
*  you wanted to be to anybody coming up to you, if they recognize you
*  from your platform.
*  But if you if you are open and inclusive
*  and taking the time to spend with people, it does so much for a community.
*  Like most people solve those boundaries completely.
*  And they're like, well, I thought I was expecting you to be kind of blah, blah,
*  or I was expecting you to be this.
*  And you're like, I'm not any of those things.
*  Let's all just have a good time, man.
*  And let's support local businesses or whatever, whatever your mantra is.
*  But in in Great Falls, it's great. I can go places.
*  And most of the time, people are just total sweethearts.
*  And they generally say thanks a lot for not forgetting about where you came from.
*  That's dope. That's huge.
*  We just did three hours, dude. Oh, shit. 37.
*  Let's get out of here.
*  Not crazy. Let's get the fuck out here.
*  Reggie Watts, ladies and gentlemen.
*  Thank you, brother.
*  You. Bye, everybody. Peace.
