# Joe Rogan Experience #2077 - Tim Dillon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And we're up. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5.72s)]
*  Let's go, Tim Dillon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=10.16s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=14.0s)]
*  I'm good now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=15.0s)]
*  Looking at that coat. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=16.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=17.0s)]
*  It's raccoon. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=18.0s)]
*  I went to a furrier in New York and two little old Jewish guys and they go, we don't have [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  anything in your size like a sable or chinchilla or any of the high end. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=26.68s)]
*  But then one of the little guys goes, we may have a raccoon in the back. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=32.3s)]
*  And he came out with this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=40.68s)]
*  And this is a raccoon. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=43.08s)]
*  But he was explaining it's from Finland. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=44.32s)]
*  Like these raccoons are Finnish. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=46.6s)]
*  Is that the actual color of their fur? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  Did they dye that? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=51.56s)]
*  Because I think it's like a blonde, almost like a like a grizzly. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=52.56s)]
*  I think the raccoons in Finland have different colors, perhaps. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=55.88s)]
*  Let's Google that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=62.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=63.0s)]
*  What does a raccoon look like in Finland? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=64.0s)]
*  Is that a different animal? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=65.0s)]
*  What do they call them? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=66.0s)]
*  They call them dumpster dogs or something? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=68.36s)]
*  Trash pandas. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=70.78s)]
*  Trash pandas. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=71.78s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=72.78s)]
*  You know, and I like a raccoon too, but I also like fur. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=73.78s)]
*  I think people should be allowed to wear fur. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=77.08000000000001s)]
*  Well it is weird that you're allowed to kill animals and eat them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=79.56s)]
*  Why do they call it a raccoon dog? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  It is kind of similar to the coat I have. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  I typed in Finland raccoon and it just keeps saying raccoon dog. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  Raccoon dog. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  See in Finland they seem to be more tan. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that looks like your coat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  That doesn't look like a raccoon. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  Like if I saw that I wouldn't say that's a raccoon. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  I'd be like, what is that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=103.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what it is. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of got a raccoon-y face. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  Like scroll back up to those images. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  Like that picture up there, that's a raccoon-y face. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=110.48s)]
*  This cute creature. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  That's a raccoon-y face. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=114.76s)]
*  But the color of it, I'd be like, what is that? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=116.2s)]
*  That one looks a little weird. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=118.2s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=119.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=120.44s)]
*  So they call them a raccoon dog? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=121.44s)]
*  I just typed in. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=124.76s)]
*  Bro, you got a dog coat on. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=125.76s)]
*  That's rough. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=127.68s)]
*  I knew it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=128.68s)]
*  I think I've got taken advantage of. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=129.68s)]
*  This was it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  They kind of looked at each other a few times and this one didn't even have the liner in. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  They put the liner in. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=141.72s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  They put the liner in. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=144.32s)]
*  They put the liner in. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=145.32s)]
*  They put the liner in. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=146.32s)]
*  I just went in because I was curious about, I don't understand it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=147.32s)]
*  I get curious about different things. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=151.04s)]
*  So these furriers in New York City, a lot of them will kick you out if you don't have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  an appointment. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=157.2s)]
*  So one of them just said, we can't deal with you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  You don't have an appointment, go. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=160.6s)]
*  But then these two guys were nice enough to talk to me a little bit and I was just asking [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  questions. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=166.04s)]
*  I'm like, what's the deal? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=167.04s)]
*  They're like, well, sable is like the top thing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=168.76s)]
*  And then they're like, obviously, Mink and Chinchilla and Fox. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=171.84s)]
*  Could they make you a custom one? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=176.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=177.84s)]
*  So you'd have to order it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=178.84s)]
*  They could absolutely make a custom one. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=179.84s)]
*  But I wanted something fun to come on here with. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=181.6s)]
*  So I said, I don't really even want one of these. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=185.12s)]
*  So I just want to do like an impulse buy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  Just give me something to buy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't want to think about this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  And you got the raccoon. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  And then the guy goes, we have a raccoon. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  It could be a costume. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  That might have been what the Patterson guy wore in the Bigfoot footage. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  I have no idea what it is, but it is a fun and it's got that hood. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=201.72s)]
*  It's got a hood like if you were a rapper or something like this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=207.16s)]
*  You know, Bill Blumenreit from Boston? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=212.32s)]
*  Of course. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  Bill had a mink coat once. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=218.52s)]
*  He let me try it on. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=219.52s)]
*  I'm like, let me try that on. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=220.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=221.52s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God, it's so warm. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=222.52s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=223.52s)]
*  There's a reason why people like them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=224.52s)]
*  But people get real mad. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=226.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=227.0s)]
*  They don't like it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=228.0s)]
*  But it's also weird. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=229.0s)]
*  Like you're allowed to wear leather. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=230.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=232.76s)]
*  What is leather? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=233.76s)]
*  If you're leather is everywhere. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=234.76s)]
*  Everybody wears leather. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=236.76s)]
*  Leather is just the fur removed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=237.76s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=240.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=241.28s)]
*  Like crocodile scales. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=242.28s)]
*  There's a company called Origin and one of the elk that I shot, we took the hide and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=243.28s)]
*  had the hide shipped to them. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=249.4s)]
*  They're going to turn into boots. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=252.28s)]
*  It's good use of leather. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=253.28s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=254.28s)]
*  But that's normal. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=255.28s)]
*  Nobody gets, nobody gets freaked out if they see you with leather boots on. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=256.28s)]
*  It wasn't this entire, I mean you know more than me, but the Native Americans who respected [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=258.92s)]
*  the, you know, the animals and the environment, it was all about utilizing every part of the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=264.92s)]
*  animal. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=273.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=274.24s)]
*  They used everything they could and they lived in harmony with them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=275.24s)]
*  Like you know, especially like some of these Native American tribes had these relationships [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  where they were migratory with the animals. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=283.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  Like, like Buffalo and the Comanche. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  They followed them around, man. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=288.88s)]
*  And they used all their blankets, all sorts of things. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=290.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=295.0s)]
*  Their teepees, everything. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=296.0s)]
*  So to me, I don't understand where it became, you know, so controversial. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=297.0s)]
*  Because it's really rich people flaunting that they can go have someone murder a mink [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=304.28s)]
*  for them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=310.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=311.64s)]
*  You're wearing this thing and you've got all these diamonds and you're walking in fabulous. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=312.64s)]
*  It's imbalanced. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=318.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=319.16s)]
*  It's grossly imbalanced. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=320.16s)]
*  To a degree. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=321.16s)]
*  You're a rapper with like hundreds in your hands. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=322.16s)]
*  You're throwing them out to the ground. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=324.92s)]
*  Sure, but somehow I look balanced with nature in this in an odd way. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=325.92s)]
*  I don't, you know, I don't even feel like I look rich in this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=329.44s)]
*  I look a little crazy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=332.32s)]
*  I look like a guy on the brink of something and not a good thing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=333.6s)]
*  It depends on what you like. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=338.56s)]
*  I would look at this, that's a fun guy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=340.88s)]
*  My initial reaction when I saw you in it was like, this is awesome. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  It's interesting because it does seem to me, I understand that people are morally against [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=348.28s)]
*  it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=354.68s)]
*  But when you start like, I don't know, throwing paint on people, right? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=355.68s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=358.96s)]
*  Red paint. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=359.96s)]
*  I was in Beverly Hills once. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=360.96s)]
*  They had like outside of a store, they were like chanting and they were trying to intimidate [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=362.52s)]
*  people walking in the store. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=366.8s)]
*  It just feels silly. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  I had a girl tell me once, she was upset at the comedy store that I had fur, I had a hoodie [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=369.2s)]
*  with fur around the edges of it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=374.68s)]
*  And she just like out of nowhere, I wasn't even talking to her. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=377.04s)]
*  She was like, something shitty about the fur. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=381.04s)]
*  I go, it's fake. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=383.8s)]
*  I go, it's fake fur. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  It's like, it's a fucking hoodie. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=387.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=388.56s)]
*  And she goes, I don't like what it represents. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  What is wrong with these people? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=391.12s)]
*  I don't represent. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=394.12s)]
*  This was a long time ago, by the way, this is not like Famous Me. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=396.44s)]
*  But I was like, this is such a crazy conversation. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, it's fake fur. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=402.36s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=403.92s)]
*  I understand people that are ethical vegans who say, I don't want any type of animal product [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=405.0s)]
*  ever. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  I disagree with that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think a lot of people on earth would disagree with that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=419.56s)]
*  I think the human race would go, would starve pretty quickly if we couldn't eat any animal [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=421.8s)]
*  product. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=427.32s)]
*  Yeah, that wouldn't work out well. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=428.32s)]
*  It wouldn't work out. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=430.36s)]
*  It is also very complicated because the relationship that we used to have with animals, like the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=431.56s)]
*  animal relationship that you're talking about with the Native Americans, where they had [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  this tribal relationship, where they followed these herds around and hunted them expertly, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=440.48s)]
*  that is so different than going to Jack in the Box. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=447.12s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=450.36s)]
*  And that's what most of what our meat is coming from, this weird subversion of the natural [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=451.36s)]
*  way of getting food. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=456.76s)]
*  The factory farming. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=458.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's never been a time ever where in human history where people have stuffed [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=459.76s)]
*  so many fucking animals into warehouses and just beheaded them. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=464.8s)]
*  But because our population has never been greater. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=468.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=471.44s)]
*  It's never been bigger. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=472.44s)]
*  We've never had more of a burden to feed people. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=473.44s)]
*  And it's unfortunate the way that it happens. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=476.92s)]
*  We've all seen the footage of the chickens that don't get to walk around. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=486.96s)]
*  Not good. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=487.96s)]
*  Also, I think that up until fairly recently, like fairly recently, like within the last [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=489.12s)]
*  couple hundred years, it was unheard of to not grow your own food. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=496.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  I think everybody sort of knew that you had to grow some of your own food or hunt some [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  of your own food. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=506.76s)]
*  Well, that's so hard now because how do you do that in Arizona? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=507.76s)]
*  You don't. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=512.36s)]
*  Like if you live in the desert. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=513.36s)]
*  You don't because, I mean, what kind of water rights do you have? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=514.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=515.76s)]
*  You have to drink soda and it's freezing. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=516.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=518.24s)]
*  So it's just it becomes difficult to live that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=519.24s)]
*  I'm sure that's the ideal way to live. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=522.04s)]
*  But the modern world is it's very hard. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=525.16s)]
*  People don't have any time. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=528.52s)]
*  No. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=529.52s)]
*  You know? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=530.52s)]
*  No, it's hard. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=531.52s)]
*  And you know, imagine what it was like before they had trucks. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=532.52s)]
*  Imagine like living in Manhattan in January in 1700 and you can't get an apple. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=536.12s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  Like there's no there's no fruit. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  You're not getting any fruit. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  You're not getting any vegetables. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, what's funny is like there's a show on HBO called The Gilded Age and it's about [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=545.6s)]
*  all these really, you know, like the robber barons, like the industrialists and like they [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  all had these massive staffs of people that would just make them dinners every night. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  Just crazy. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=559.24s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=560.24s)]
*  They had entire staffs of like usually Irish chefs and cooks and waiters and everything [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=561.24s)]
*  just to facilitate the meal, the daily meal. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=568.5200000000001s)]
*  It was very royal and regal and they would have people just there cooking for them and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  making their food. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  And it was it's interesting to watch because. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=579.9599999999999s)]
*  The haves and the have nots back then. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  Back then it was wild. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=584.52s)]
*  Like people say it's wild now and it is wild now because a lot of the haves now can take [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  a spaceship and, you know, take a blunt drive around the globe. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=590.4799999999999s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=595.76s)]
*  How much carbon does that burn off into the atmosphere? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=596.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=599.64s)]
*  I mean, if you want to talk about some of the most ridiculous excesses of carbon use. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=600.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's shooting rich people into orbit. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=605.92s)]
*  That's so nuts. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=609.4s)]
*  That must be so much gas. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=610.4s)]
*  It's so nuts. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=612.1999999999999s)]
*  But like anything else, right, they'll say, well, it's good for, I guess, the it incentivizes [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=613.1999999999999s)]
*  people to care about space exploration. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=621.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=623.08s)]
*  Because they are going to pay a lot of money to go up there. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=624.08s)]
*  And that money is going to get utilized to discover more things. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=627.04s)]
*  Who knows if that's. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=630.88s)]
*  It's a weird argument. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=633.64s)]
*  Yeah, because like I feel like I mean, look, I'm happy that they're exploring space, but [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  I feel like maybe someone should sit down and go, until you guys figure out a better [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=640.32s)]
*  way to get off the fucking ground. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=643.36s)]
*  Yeah, let's just let's just chill. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=644.96s)]
*  How are we saying no one should burn carbon fuel? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=647.24s)]
*  How are we saying that you can't have gas powered cars in California after 2035? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=650.4s)]
*  I was saying that while we're shooting off these giant metal tubes of jet fuel, it's [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=656.08s)]
*  literally burning in the sky. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=665.12s)]
*  I think that's the reward when you have a billion dollars is to you can you you want [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=666.64s)]
*  to think you can leave. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=673.4s)]
*  Yeah, that seems to be the reward. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=674.88s)]
*  It's these guys going like we don't have it quite figured out yet, but they're like, God, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=677.08s)]
*  it might be nice if I could leave. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=681.72s)]
*  Oh, my God, it would be hell. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=683.76s)]
*  It would be tough. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=685.72s)]
*  It would be so stupid. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=686.48s)]
*  The first person that leaves, they're going to fall. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=687.8000000000001s)]
*  There's a trap. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  And here's a trap. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=691.6s)]
*  Just because something's hard to do doesn't mean it's good to do. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=692.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=695.64s)]
*  And you could say it's going to be so difficult for us to get to Mars. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=696.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=700.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  Also so difficult for someone to fucking save you. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=701.28s)]
*  For a reason. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=704.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's not a good place to go. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=705.12s)]
*  No, we have spots in Earth that suck. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=707.32s)]
*  Go visit those. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=711.04s)]
*  They can get you out by helicopter if you're lucky. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=712.6800000000001s)]
*  These people want I think there's that fantasy of like seeding other planets with biological [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=715.44s)]
*  DNA carrying on the human race. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=723.32s)]
*  The idea that the earth might be past a tipping point. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=726.4s)]
*  Maybe I think we have to realize that time does not give a fuck about the human race. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=729.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=738.2s)]
*  Time doesn't care. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=738.6s)]
*  If we got hit by an asteroid and this whole planet got knocked back down into the Jurassic [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=740.48s)]
*  period again, that totally could happen. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=747.12s)]
*  It's happened before. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=749.7199999999999s)]
*  That's the reason why we're here in the first place, supposedly. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=750.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=753.28s)]
*  The Yucatan impact. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=754.0799999999999s)]
*  If that happens again, time doesn't care. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=756.4399999999999s)]
*  Time doesn't care. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=759.9599999999999s)]
*  Can we do anything to the asteroid now that we're more advanced? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=760.9599999999999s)]
*  They are slowly but surely being able to recognize where they... [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=765.6s)]
*  The real problem supposedly, I believe, is ones that come from too near the sun. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=769.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  The problem is the gravity of the sun. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=776.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm sure I'm fucking this up. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=778.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=779.9200000000001s)]
*  I think the gravity of the sun, the mass of the sun is so immense that it's difficult to [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=781.1600000000001s)]
*  see objects that are behind it coming towards us. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=786.72s)]
*  So if something's passing the sun and going towards us, we might not see it until it's [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  too late to do anything about it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=794.32s)]
*  And then even if we do see it, there's only a few different methods that they've devised [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=796.2s)]
*  that seem to... [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=801.56s)]
*  Like one of them is you like hit it with a surface, like something lands on it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=802.4399999999999s)]
*  And this changing of the aerodynamics of it changes its trajectory in some way. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=807.48s)]
*  And another one is breaking it up. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=815.68s)]
*  The breaking it up one scares people though, because they're like, well, what if you [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=818.12s)]
*  break it up into many pieces that just go to a bunch of different spots on Earth and [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=821.36s)]
*  it has the same impact, just not one spot? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=826.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=828.5200000000001s)]
*  Like you might actually... [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=829.12s)]
*  Maybe it would have landed in the ocean and most people would survive. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  It's amazing that nothing... [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=834.1600000000001s)]
*  We haven't had a really... [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=835.8000000000001s)]
*  And you might know more than I do, but we haven't had a really like destructive asteroid [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=839.6800000000001s)]
*  impact in a long time. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=845.72s)]
*  It's a timeline thing, dude. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=847.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=849.36s)]
*  Our timeline is our lifetime and it's so long for a person and it's so nothing for space. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=849.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=856.6s)]
*  It's so nothing. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=856.96s)]
*  It literally is nothing. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=858.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=859.88s)]
*  Our timeline is a hundred years for a human timeline. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=860.52s)]
*  The Earth is four point whatever billion years old. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=863.68s)]
*  The universe... [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=866.92s)]
*  There's all these arguments now. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=868.4s)]
*  The universe is even older than 13.7 billion years ago. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=869.84s)]
*  I'm not really smart enough to understand it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=872.64s)]
*  It's something about the forming of the galaxies. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=874.28s)]
*  Like they seem to form quicker. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=876.08s)]
*  That wouldn't be possible if the Earth was only... [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=878.0400000000001s)]
*  If the universe was only 13.7 billion years. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=880.24s)]
*  But Brian Keating doesn't agree with it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  So maybe he's right. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=884.28s)]
*  I don't know who's right, but it's either way we're a hundred years of nothing. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=885.24s)]
*  It's so quick. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=891.36s)]
*  And if we get hit with an asteroid and then everything starts and it's another 65 million [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=892.64s)]
*  years from now until a new form of intelligent life arises, the universe doesn't care about that. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=898.52s)]
*  No. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=904.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=905.08s)]
*  Me saying we haven't had a significant impact is like when your 13 year old starts talking [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  about Israel and Palestine. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=910.5200000000001s)]
*  Like they just don't... [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=912.2800000000001s)]
*  I sound ridiculous because it's literally... [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=915.1600000000001s)]
*  I've been on the planet 38 years and I'm like, we haven't had anything. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=917.9200000000001s)]
*  As you get older, you get old enough to realize this hustle. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=923.08s)]
*  You get, oh, this is a hustle. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=927.5200000000001s)]
*  Like you're pretending like you can do something. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=929.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=931.96s)]
*  You're pretending like you're going to make a life and leave a mark and all. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=932.2s)]
*  It's you're just moving. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=935.4000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=937.36s)]
*  And you're going to be gone and new people are going to move into that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=937.72s)]
*  And everyone's affecting everybody. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=941.24s)]
*  And we're all working towards some weird goal. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=943.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=946.12s)]
*  And some of it involves rockets and computers. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=946.6s)]
*  And we're just building wilder and wilder technology. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=950.32s)]
*  But I don't know if we can escape before something hits. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=953.4000000000001s)]
*  And I have a feeling that's what's happened many times in the past. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=957.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that's the biggest key to the mystery of people. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=960.88s)]
*  And you think that we may have gotten to this point? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=964.4s)]
*  I think we definitely did. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=966.84s)]
*  Where people were podcasting in ridiculous coats. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=967.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=970.36s)]
*  And then something comes and ruins it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=970.8s)]
*  And then it takes billions of years to get back to that. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=973.28s)]
*  Millions. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=976.4399999999999s)]
*  Millions to get back to that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=977.08s)]
*  Not really millions. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=979.0s)]
*  I think probably whatever the Egyptians were doing, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=980.08s)]
*  I think they were the most advanced civilization that ever existed. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=984.28s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=987.52s)]
*  This is I mean, I'm out of line here for sure. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=989.0s)]
*  Listen, if you're an archaeologist and you're pulling your hair out, I get it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=992.08s)]
*  But I don't think we could do what they did. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=996.12s)]
*  I think if we just look at it for just the sheer dynamics, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=998.88s)]
*  the volume of stone that they moved, the precision in which they built it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  I really don't think we can do that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1008.72s)]
*  Just the symmetry of the faces of the statues is unparalleled. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1010.5600000000001s)]
*  And they're immense. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1016.76s)]
*  These are monstrously huge, perfectly symmetrical faces. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1018.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1023.28s)]
*  Their temples are insanely intricate with 20 ton, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1024.0s)]
*  gigantic stone blocks that were taken from a mountain 500 miles away. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1031.4s)]
*  And no one has any idea how the fuck they got nobody has any clue. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  No guess. Right. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1040.0s)]
*  There's some guesses about, oh, maybe the river system was different back then. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1041.48s)]
*  Whatever. How are you getting that 50 ton chunk of granite [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1044.8s)]
*  out of a fucking mountain and moving it down even with modern equipment? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1049.6s)]
*  How are you getting it over the mountain? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1053.16s)]
*  So it seems like you don't even have roads. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1054.8s)]
*  What do you do? They were incredibly advanced, incredibly advanced [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1056.44s)]
*  with math, with science, with technology, certainly with geometry. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1060.44s)]
*  They also had an understanding of the cosmos. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1065.76s)]
*  They definitely had an understanding of the constellations. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1068.84s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why the fringe theory is that the Sphinx [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1072.3200000000002s)]
*  is way older than what they have it currently dated at was like 2500 BC, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1077.3600000000001s)]
*  which is still crazy old. Right. Right. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1083.72s)]
*  But what they think is it's probably older than that, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1085.8000000000002s)]
*  maybe even 10000 or 30000 years old. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1088.44s)]
*  And that at these times in whenever the calendar is aligned properly, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1091.64s)]
*  whatever the year is, it's like exactly where a lion [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1097.24s)]
*  would be staring the constellation Leo. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1101.2s)]
*  That's mind blowing. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1105.04s)]
*  Mind to think about that stuff. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1106.72s)]
*  I don't know if that's true, though. That's a weird one. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1108.28s)]
*  It's like, how do we know if like there's from the burning [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1110.68s)]
*  of the Library of Alexandria, we lost so much of an understanding [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1113.56s)]
*  of what the Egyptians knew and what they recorded. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1117.1200000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot like there's a lot of weird speculation amongst Egyptologists. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1120.0s)]
*  Like they look at the old they have hieroglyphs [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1124.0800000000002s)]
*  that show kings that go back 40000 years. Right. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1126.8400000000001s)]
*  And they look that they look at that as myth. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1130.24s)]
*  But so it gets to a certain time and they decide, OK, now this is really [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1133.6s)]
*  this is Tutankhamun. This is Ramsey. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1137.9599999999998s)]
*  Are we talking about Biblical times or even we're pre dating that pre [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1140.3999999999999s)]
*  pre Biblical really predating the biblical times if they're correct. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1145.84s)]
*  If these hieroglyphs are real, instead of like saying that they're myth [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1150.24s)]
*  because they're talking about kings that ruled the earth [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1153.8s)]
*  40000 years ago when we decided that those people back then were primitive. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1156.3600000000001s)]
*  But if they're right and if it only existed in a few places on earth, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1161.0400000000002s)]
*  would that make sense? Right. That's how it is now. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1164.6000000000001s)]
*  You can go right now. You can go to the Amazon. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1167.3200000000002s)]
*  You see people living like they live thousands of years ago. Right. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1168.96s)]
*  And then you can see someone here get hit by a car [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1171.4s)]
*  because they're looking at their phone. That's right. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1173.28s)]
*  You know, it's like they're both existing at the same time. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1174.8400000000001s)]
*  I think that's probably always been the case with people. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1177.1200000000001s)]
*  There's always been like people that live in Siberia, these nomadic tribal people [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1179.52s)]
*  that are very content, just living the same way they've always lived. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1183.48s)]
*  And then there's people that live in San Francisco that have people [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1186.76s)]
*  shitting on their street and fucking shooting up in front of them, getting paid. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1188.92s)]
*  Yeah. So it's interesting. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1192.44s)]
*  You just you've always kind of had that dichotomy of really advanced people [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1193.88s)]
*  and then really, you know, I don't want to use the word primitive, but certainly, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1198.56s)]
*  you know, these uncontacted tribes and things like that. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1202.24s)]
*  Human beings always have inequality. Yeah. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1205.32s)]
*  There's always that strata. There's always something. Right. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1207.56s)]
*  And it's whether it's cultural, whether it's geographical, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1210.16s)]
*  whether you're trapped on an island, like whatever. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1212.6s)]
*  You're always going to find somewhere, somewhere on Earth, someone who's just [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1214.36s)]
*  way beyond like what we think of as like modern society, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1218.9599999999998s)]
*  like what's acceptable, running what these people have. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1225.7199999999998s)]
*  None of that. Right. These people, they're making their own spears. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1227.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. They're hunting. They have leaves on their dicks. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1231.4399999999998s)]
*  They're killing animals. Yeah. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1233.56s)]
*  For an added necessity. Yeah, the necessity. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1235.24s)]
*  Because those animals might kill them. Yeah. Right. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1237.52s)]
*  They know what leaves to take. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1240.08s)]
*  Have you ever seen those people? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1241.64s)]
*  I think the waranami, is that what they're called in Guiana? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  They throw poison in the water. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1246.3200000000002s)]
*  Have you gone to like, have you gone to Machu Picchu or Brazil [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1248.5600000000002s)]
*  or the Amazon or anything? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1253.68s)]
*  The only places that I've been to that are really like I just got back from Greece. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. We did Greece. That was amazing. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1258.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's amazing. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1261.16s)]
*  But that's you're talking like 2500 years old. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1262.16s)]
*  That's it's like a child compared to the pyramids. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1265.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's really amazing antiquity and how old things are. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1269.6399999999999s)]
*  And then where where the line is between what is myth [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1274.6799999999998s)]
*  and what is history and trying to figure that out, which is no, it's very hard. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1279.04s)]
*  I think that even the stuff that we think of as like the cradle of wisdom, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1284.1999999999998s)]
*  like what happened in Greece when they were building the Acropolis [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1289.4399999999998s)]
*  and the Parthenon and when they were all where democracy came from. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1293.8s)]
*  I think that is like a rebuilding of civilization. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1298.72s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1302.32s)]
*  And I think if you can go back in a time machine, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1303.28s)]
*  I bet if you could get to Egypt 25000 years ago, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1306.36s)]
*  I bet you'd be fucking blown away. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1311.1599999999999s)]
*  I bet they had some very bizarre, technologically advanced society [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1313.6s)]
*  that had a different path they went down. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1319.04s)]
*  So we went down the path of engines and computers and right. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1321.8799999999999s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that's the only way to invent technology. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1325.84s)]
*  Just the path that we've been on. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1329.12s)]
*  Right. They had figured out some other stuff. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1330.92s)]
*  They had figured out if they had hundreds of thousands of years of time [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1333.52s)]
*  to really evolve and become modern humans, which is what we think now. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1338.48s)]
*  They used to think that people were only around for like 50000 years, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1343.32s)]
*  like anatomically modern humans. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1345.92s)]
*  But now they pushed it back to like 200000 years ago. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1348.16s)]
*  It keeps going back further and further and further. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1350.8s)]
*  So people really did live that long. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1353.2s)]
*  It's think about how quick we went from like 1800 to 2023. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1356.28s)]
*  Yeah, insane. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1363.68s)]
*  It's quick. But the difference in riding around on a fucking wagon, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1365.24s)]
*  being dragged by an animal or some stupid boat you had to take across the Atlantic. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1369.56s)]
*  Right. And no one had any idea where the icebergs were. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1374.64s)]
*  Yeah. To now existing, you know, primarily in like, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1377.08s)]
*  you know, half in and half out of a completely digital universe. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1382.2s)]
*  Yes, half in, half out, connected constantly to your phone. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1385.48s)]
*  And every book, like I'm reading a book now called The Dimensions of a Cave, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1388.92s)]
*  and it's basically about what will things look like when we are more fully [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1391.92s)]
*  on that digital platform? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1397.56s)]
*  Like what constitutes a crime in the digital world? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1399.52s)]
*  What does war look like when everything's digital? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1403.28s)]
*  What happens if something like grand theft of honor, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1407.4s)]
*  if people get prosecuted for beating people up? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1409.56s)]
*  Well, this is what you know, there's like weird, like ethical questions [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1411.56s)]
*  about like when we're living a lot of our lives on these digital platforms. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1415.68s)]
*  Right. What is a crime? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1421.36s)]
*  What is surveillance when everything surveillance? Right. Right. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1423.24s)]
*  What are you know, what are the laws? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1426.92s)]
*  What are the rules? What are the consequences for breaking them? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1429.24s)]
*  Can you be cast out of that? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1432.04s)]
*  You know, just like the way we debate social media now, imagine [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1434.44s)]
*  it's even more immersive than social media. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1437.68s)]
*  It's augmented reality, virtual reality, some form of metaverse, whatever it is. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1440.52s)]
*  Can we do we cast you out where you can't [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1446.16s)]
*  participate in this thing that everybody else is participating in? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1449.8s)]
*  And these are interesting questions because people are saying that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1454.52s)]
*  we'll probably get there quicker than we think. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1457.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, in the space of maybe 10 years or something, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1460.92s)]
*  they're they're looking at these programs and platforms and going, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1465.44s)]
*  oh, there's going to be a lot like that's why the AI battle [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1469.88s)]
*  that they had with Hollywood, it seems ultimately a losing battle. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1473.2s)]
*  Like it, which is, you know, not something that I love, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1477.8s)]
*  but ultimately, it seems like look at the trailer for the new GTA. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1481.16s)]
*  It's pretty amazing. Amazing. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1485.1200000000001s)]
*  Imagine that even better. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1486.68s)]
*  You know, it seems like there is going to be a time [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1490.72s)]
*  when we're watching a show of all AI people and enjoying it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1494.24s)]
*  And that's just what it is. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1500.28s)]
*  And maybe we're even feeling like we're involved or immersed in it. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1501.56s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe we're sitting there watching a guy get shot or ran over [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1505.92s)]
*  or watching a hooker get killed. I don't know. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1510.2s)]

*  most people can't do much about the news anyway. Right. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1579.24s)]

*  They're kind of doing that. They choose their own news. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1600.0s)]
*  My aunt chooses her news in her news. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1601.72s)]
*  Donald Trump has been running the government for the last four years. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1605.52s)]
*  He speaks to the generals directly. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1609.76s)]
*  Biden has been dead for a while, which, by the way, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1612.4399999999998s)]
*  that's harder and harder to argue with her about. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1615.96s)]
*  And in her news, Donald Trump will then come back to the throne. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1618.4399999999998s)]
*  But he's still running anything that she goes, anything she tells us. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1624.4399999999998s)]

*  Already, I love it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1640.28s)]
*  If you look at old photos of Biden, his earlobe hangs down. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1641.84s)]
*  As he gets older, his earlobe is connected, which is impossible. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1647.08s)]
*  That's odd. It's impossible. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1651.32s)]
*  Like your ear, your ear doesn't change its position unless you get surgery. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1653.36s)]
*  So what do we think? I think he had a facelift. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1656.96s)]
*  Oh, definitely. 100 percent. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1659.84s)]
*  Definitely. Which is, by the way, that doesn't work on guys. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1661.96s)]
*  It doesn't make you look better. It just makes you look weird. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1666.16s)]
*  Your face is shining. Putin in Russia has different doubles. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1669.52s)]
*  He has body doubles. He has body doubles. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1673.0s)]
*  But they 100 percent can do that. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1674.6000000000001s)]
*  They can do that with makeup. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1677.28s)]
*  Like I've seen videos where a person is talking [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1678.64s)]
*  and it just looks like some weird old man. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1681.2s)]
*  And they just grab their face and peel it off. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1683.3600000000001s)]
*  Like there's the makeup they can do is like Hollywood stuff, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1685.4s)]
*  like stuff like Rick Baker could do. Sure. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1688.76s)]
*  Like they have like real. No, it's insane. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1691.2s)]
*  I did some dumb cameo in a horror movie and they they made my whole head. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1692.8s)]
*  Yeah, they just made my head. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1697.76s)]
*  They molded it. It looks exactly like my head. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1700.92s)]
*  And they cut it off. Yeah. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1704.28s)]
*  It's the special effects and the ability to do things like that is insane. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1706.1200000000001s)]
*  It's insane. And they can 3D print things now. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1711.52s)]
*  They the technology is so good and the materials are so good. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1714.48s)]
*  And these artists are fucking incredible. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1719.32s)]
*  They can 100 percent make you look like a totally different person. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1721.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, for sure. I guarantee you they employ some of those people. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1723.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. If you were going to have someone and they were like a CIA undercover person [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1727.04s)]
*  going into a terrorist organization, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1731.36s)]
*  wouldn't you fucking have them dressed differently? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1734.36s)]
*  Absolutely. Different face. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1737.6s)]
*  Absolutely. Why wouldn't you do that? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1739.56s)]
*  Well, the things that they're doing at DARPA and all of these things [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1741.52s)]
*  are so far from what we you know, they had the Internet in the 70s, right? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1745.8s)]
*  They had a version of it. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1750.76s)]
*  Did you see this new stealth bomber? No. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1751.8s)]

*  Hold on. So they're I mean, they're doing stuff that's far beyond our conception. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1755.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes. They're doing some wild shit that they're telling us about. Right. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1759.84s)]
*  This is from the Drinkin Bros podcast. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1764.2s)]

*  And if you're rich enough, can you rent it out? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1772.48s)]
*  Take it up? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1776.36s)]
*  No, I don't think it has humans in it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1778.0s)]

*  I realize it was some Caitlyn Jenner thing. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1789.2s)]
*  I was saying Caitlyn Jenner's in a stealth bomber is odd. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1791.0s)]
*  It like sometimes it just changes. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1794.44s)]

*  Don't go on your phone when you're up. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1813.96s)]
*  I bet she is. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1816.24s)]
*  But she's on the phone. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1817.44s)]
*  I bet Caitlyn Jenner's in that plane on her phone, probably checking them, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1818.24s)]
*  tweeting about how much she loves Donald Trump [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1821.92s)]
*  because that's what she was telling everybody. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1825.6s)]

*  Yeah. We're at the end of time. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1837.52s)]
*  Time. Yeah. Check this bucket. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1841.56s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1843.92s)]
*  Check this thing out. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1844.96s)]
*  This thing, it carries, I think, four nukes or six nukes. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1846.3600000000001s)]
*  This is amazing. Yeah. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1852.68s)]
*  And it but the thing is, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1855.0s)]
*  the original stealth come out. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1856.28s)]
*  Put the link because I want to play that because he describes [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1858.1200000000001s)]
*  all the things it does in terms of jamming radar. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1861.24s)]
*  It's crazy what this thing was the first stealth in like the 80s or the 90s. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1864.96s)]
*  I want to say the 90s. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1870.84s)]
*  That makes sense, Jamie. Yeah. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1872.0s)]
*  It's essentially 100 percent radar proof. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1873.88s)]
*  It cannot be detected except for with your eyeballs. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1876.2s)]
*  This one right here. Holy shit. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1878.2s)]
*  It looks sexy as fuck. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1880.48s)]
*  But that's just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1881.8s)]
*  So it has it is able to analyze algorithmically [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1884.88s)]
*  the enemy's radar package, like how they're able to determine radar. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1889.8000000000002s)]
*  And then it can fucking instantaneously send that information, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1893.76s)]
*  not not just radar, but so it can it can. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1898.2s)]
*  Instantaneously. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=1902.4s)]

*  It's a vertical money laundering scheme. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2159.96s)]
*  When I understood because I was a tour guide in New York and I used to ask all these questions all the time. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2162.08s)]
*  I go, so what happens to the Chinese people come here and they go, well, we love Central Park [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2166.96s)]
*  and they want to live there and they go, yeah, but, you know, they spend maybe a few weeks a year. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2173.7599999999998s)]

*  And a lot of foreign buyers will not just buy one apartment. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2182.8s)]

*  And they'll just stash their money. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2189.0400000000004s)]
*  They'll have a floor of a building. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2190.5600000000004s)]
*  Maybe they'll throw a kid in at NYU, go, you go become non-binary and disgrace us. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2192.6400000000003s)]

*  But a lot of times these things are completely empty. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2208.48s)]
*  It's criminal criminality. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2212.48s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2214.96s)]
*  It's a good method to move money around though. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2215.68s)]
*  It's really smart. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2219.44s)]
*  Oh, it's really smart. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2220.48s)]
*  And it's great because real estate is perfect to launder money. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2221.52s)]
*  You can buy it with a shell corp. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2225.7599999999998s)]
*  You don't have to buy it under your name. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2227.68s)]
*  You can buy it under that. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2229.84s)]
*  And by the way, you can disguise that shell corp with a hundred other shell corp so that like [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2230.96s)]
*  nobody's going to go through. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2235.84s)]
*  It's like a pad where they'd have to keep flipping pages to find the actual owner of [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2237.44s)]
*  the actual company. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2242.96s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2248.96s)]

*  I don't know what you mean, but I am agreeing. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2251.52s)]
*  The family, there was a bunch of shell corps that were involved. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2254.96s)]
*  Well, Hunter Biden's an attorney, number one, and he did some financial investments, but [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2259.36s)]
*  he certainly had a very healthy budget for fun. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2264.16s)]
*  And now he had a budget for extracurricular activities. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2269.6s)]
*  And where does that come from? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2275.04s)]
*  It's a slush fund that comes from a lot of shady dealings. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2276.96s)]
*  This guy had no expertise in energy. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2281.2s)]

*  It's an insane amount of money. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2292.3199999999997s)]
*  I think the last count was, is it a hundred and seventy billion dollars? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2294.72s)]
*  How much money have we given to Ukraine? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2300.56s)]
*  And it's just interesting that that's the country that our president's son [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2302.56s)]
*  was having his little internship. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2306.72s)]

*  Sometimes coincidences happen. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2310.9599999999996s)]
*  But it's no, we can't, you know what it is? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2312.56s)]
*  It's like, I watched the most, the worst people in the world, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2314.24s)]
*  the people at Beverly Hills who like scream at valets and yell at their nannies. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2319.44s)]
*  And they're not humanitarians. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2323.36s)]
*  Overnight, they all had Ukrainian flags. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2326.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2328.88s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2329.1200000000003s)]
*  They don't care about Darfur, the Sudan, anything going on in Africa. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2330.4s)]
*  They don't care about any of the problems happening in countries like Yemen. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2335.2000000000003s)]
*  But they all immediately decided almost overnight [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2339.6000000000004s)]
*  that the only humanitarian crisis worth caring about was the Ukraine. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2343.84s)]
*  Well, when baseball season's over, you start paying attention to football. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2348.16s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2352.16s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2352.96s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2353.92s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2355.12s)]
*  It's sports for dorks. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2355.6s)]
*  Just how much aid is US sent to Ukraine? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2357.7599999999998s)]
*  Total seventy five point four billion. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2360.64s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2363.2799999999997s)]
*  I think there's more. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2363.68s)]
*  I think that's not. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2364.48s)]
*  I see more too, but this is a few things. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2365.6s)]
*  And you know how much of this aid disappears. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2367.68s)]
*  First of all, isn't it funny that we're saying seventy five billion? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2369.8399999999997s)]
*  I think it's more. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2372.24s)]
*  Like that's a low number. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2372.8799999999997s)]
*  But how much of this aid disappears off the backs of trucks? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2374.48s)]
*  Oh, it's one hundred thirteen billion. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2378.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2379.68s)]
*  That's his past. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2380.0s)]
*  Present. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2380.64s)]
*  And by the way, you could start looking into how much of it is just evaporated. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2380.96s)]
*  How much of that money's disappeared. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2384.88s)]
*  Where it went. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2386.8s)]
*  Well, there was this one story about this one guy who had pilfered off a billion dollars [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2387.68s)]
*  and they didn't even arrest him. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2392.24s)]
*  They just made him resign. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2393.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2395.12s)]
*  And I was like, what is that story about? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2395.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2397.44s)]
*  I read the headline. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2397.68s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to get to that eventually. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2398.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2399.84s)]
*  Did you see that story, Jamie? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2400.24s)]
*  Whenever you're dispersing money in a war, it's always strange because you have to pay [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2403.2s)]
*  people off. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2406.96s)]
*  It's a perfect place for things to disappear money wise. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2409.04s)]
*  One of my favorite moments during all this was the New York Times going after Candace Owens. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2412.88s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2418.4s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2419.04s)]
*  For what they had reported. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2419.52s)]
*  They said to her, what evidence do you have that Ukraine is corrupt? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2421.68s)]
*  It's corrupt. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2426.32s)]
*  And she said, your fucking newspaper. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2426.96s)]
*  From just a couple of years ago. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2430.08s)]
*  It was like 2017 or 18 or something. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2433.52s)]
*  There were a million vice documentaries about how Ukraine was the home of white nationalism. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2435.28s)]
*  The thing we were all supposedly, this was the greatest threat to human civilization. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2440.8s)]
*  And we were told that every single day. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2446.88s)]
*  This country, the Ukraine, was a white nationalist country that had lots of these groups that [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2449.52s)]
*  fomented terror and they were going to start working with the white nationalist groups in [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2456.48s)]
*  America. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2461.36s)]
*  And that's what there was articles written about that. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2462.1600000000003s)]
*  There were documentaries about that. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2464.48s)]
*  All of that became, went out the window. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2466.32s)]
*  Do you remember when? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2469.36s)]
*  Right out the window. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2470.08s)]
*  Who was it? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2470.96s)]
*  Was it John Stewart that gave that dude the award? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2471.44s)]
*  He gave him a medal. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2473.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2475.04s)]
*  I'm sure Stewart doesn't even know. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2475.84s)]
*  It's like this guy's a hero. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2477.2s)]
*  You pin something on him. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2479.2s)]
*  But they are, listen, they're avowed neo-Nazis in that country. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2481.04s)]
*  They have SS tattoos. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2486.96s)]
*  This is not a conspiracy theory. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2488.48s)]
*  It's not everybody. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2490.8s)]
*  But that Azov Battalion is a huge force. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2492.08s)]
*  That's so wild. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2498.48s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2499.36s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons people think Zelensky, who's going to sign those Minsk Accords [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2500.16s)]
*  and end this little civil war issue they had going on in the Northern province in Donbas, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2504.7999999999997s)]
*  he didn't sign any that people think and people have pontificated that either those hardliners [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2511.44s)]
*  in the Ukrainian government and military go, you signed this. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2519.6s)]
*  We'll kill you. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2521.68s)]
*  Or the US State Department was like, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2524.16s)]
*  You don't sign this. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2528.8799999999997s)]
*  You keep doing what you're doing. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2530.16s)]
*  And if there is a war, we have your back. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2532.08s)]
*  And this is a well-known fact that everybody wanted some type of agreement [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2535.2s)]
*  before there was a war with these Northern Russian-speaking regions [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2544.64s)]
*  and the government of Ukraine so that there was autonomy to a certain degree, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2549.2s)]
*  that they could speak the language, that they could have political parties. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2553.8399999999997s)]
*  And again, I'm not saying that Russia is like, even though I do, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2557.4399999999996s)]
*  I am spiritually Russian. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2560.0s)]
*  Someone told me that. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2561.3599999999997s)]
*  And I have a Russian aesthetic. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2562.3199999999997s)]
*  But that's not why I'm saying this. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2564.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying the facts are all there. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2566.56s)]
*  And we've had this long bloody war in which every time this guy wants to negotiate [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2569.2799999999997s)]
*  or thinks about, we go, don't, don't, keep going, keep fighting. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2574.56s)]
*  We got you. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2579.3599999999997s)]
*  And then, you know, Nikki Haley, all these people go, no, it's civilizational. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2580.7999999999997s)]
*  By the way, nothing's regional. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2585.12s)]
*  Everything's civilizational. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2587.04s)]
*  Israel, Palestine, civilizational. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2588.64s)]
*  It's odd. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2591.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like, but wait a minute, that's been a regional conflict forever since 1946. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2592.3199999999997s)]
*  They go, no, no, no, it's about values. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2598.16s)]
*  It's about our values. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2600.48s)]
*  So we got to send them billions of dollars [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2602.0s)]
*  and we might have to get involved because it's about our value. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2604.3199999999997s)]
*  And you start going, wait a minute, it's about our values in northern Ukraine? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2607.2799999999997s)]
*  So all of these little, and I'm not saying they're little, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2611.4399999999996s)]
*  but all of these conflicts, we can't not get involved. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2614.96s)]
*  We can't in some way. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2619.2799999999997s)]
*  We have to be involved. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2620.72s)]
*  We have to fund them. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2622.0s)]
*  We have to give weapons because we convince everybody [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2622.7999999999997s)]
*  that all of these conflicts are a big battle for the future of civilization. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2625.3599999999997s)]
*  And the next step is Putin's going to steamroll Vermont. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2632.16s)]
*  He's coming to Vermont. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2636.24s)]
*  You let him do what he's doing in the Ukraine, he's going to steamroll. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2637.92s)]
*  He's coming to Aspen. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2641.7599999999998s)]
*  You want to see what happens when Russia owns Aspen? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2643.44s)]
*  And nobody thinks logically, like maybe we like war. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2647.36s)]
*  Maybe we just like having a constant business. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2651.84s)]
*  Maybe Eisenhower was right. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2656.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2658.0s)]
*  And Eisenhower warned people when he was leaving office. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2658.32s)]
*  I mean, that should be required listening to anybody that's [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2661.8399999999997s)]
*  confused as to why we're doing certain things. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2665.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2668.24s)]
*  They're making a lot of money right now. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2669.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2674.08s)]
*  They're making great money and I'm not making any of it from that. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2675.12s)]
*  And if you could have some sort of a motivation. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2678.96s)]
*  You got some sort of motivation like you're trying to save civilization. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2681.2799999999997s)]

*  You can justify so much. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2684.64s)]
*  Now, notice that when Saudi Arabia is killing Yemenis, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2686.3199999999997s)]
*  it's not civilizational. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2689.84s)]

*  with money and weapons from the US through Saudi Arabia, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2704.4s)]

*  a Zempik or whatever, but he's not getting a dollar. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2788.4s)]
*  No one's giving him anything. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2790.8s)]
*  He's a weird one. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2792.16s)]
*  He's just there to ruin things. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2793.6s)]
*  Here's what I appreciate about Chris Christie. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2795.36s)]
*  He exists only to destroy. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2797.44s)]
*  He's not trying to build. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2800.96s)]
*  He cannot win. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2802.4s)]
*  He's not going to be elected. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2803.84s)]
*  He's there to kill that Vivek Rameswamy. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2805.28s)]
*  He's going to kill him one day. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2808.0800000000004s)]
*  He's there to just destroy other people. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2809.92s)]
*  He's not there to succeed and he knows it. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2812.48s)]
*  And Nikki Haley now is having the big meetings. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2814.96s)]
*  She's having the big closed door meetings when they take you up to [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2817.28s)]
*  Montreal, California in the Bohemian Grove and they sit you down by the redwood trees [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2820.0800000000004s)]
*  and you go, I like, I like your style. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2824.48s)]
*  I just like what now, by the way, who the hell is Nikki? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2828.5600000000004s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2831.6000000000004s)]
*  No one cares. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2832.1600000000003s)]
*  She was the governor of what? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2833.1200000000003s)]
*  Was she the governor of South Carolina? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2834.56s)]
*  Great. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2836.8s)]
*  Great. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2837.28s)]
*  Great. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2837.92s)]
*  But again, none of these people gave a shit back then. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2838.56s)]
*  I think her big thing was when someone climbed to the top of the state house and took away [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2841.04s)]
*  the Confederate flag, she was like, well, that's good. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2845.92s)]
*  I think she didn't do anything. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2848.96s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2850.48s)]
*  She had that moment of like, look at me. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2851.28s)]
*  I'm the governor and I'm progressive. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2853.52s)]
*  I'll let people vandalize the Capitol maybe for its good reason, whatever. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2855.12s)]
*  But nobody, nobody knew who this bitch was. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2859.36s)]
*  Until she got on stage and started saying, hey, I really like, I would love to go to war. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2862.4s)]
*  I would love to go to war. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2869.6s)]
*  And then all of a sudden all the money started going, you know, Nikki Haley, who she's not [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2870.88s)]
*  a particularly engaging or electric, you know, she's fine, but she's not like, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2875.44s)]
*  she's not like somebody who's like, whoa. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2880.96s)]
*  So what do they do? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2883.6800000000003s)]
*  Do they step in and say we need better speech writers? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2884.56s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2888.32s)]
*  Do they say we need some sort of a clear dynamic message that comes from you that's uniquely [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2889.04s)]
*  from a woman's perspective that might excite Republicans? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2894.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2897.2799999999997s)]
*  The Karl Rove type sit down and go, we've really lost our way here. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2897.6s)]
*  We've lost our way because right after 9-11, we were able to sell people on this idea [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2901.7599999999998s)]
*  that America had to dominate every corner of the globe. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2907.68s)]
*  And we were going to throw a lot of lives at that. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2913.68s)]
*  And we were going to spend a lot of money to do that. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2916.0s)]
*  And that's what's ultimately going to make us safer and secure us. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2919.52s)]
*  And Americans after the Iraq war did not believe that. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2922.48s)]
*  The Americans said, no, we're not. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2925.6s)]
*  We don't believe that. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2927.12s)]
*  So then all these neocons became Democrats. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2928.48s)]
*  All the people that had pushed that war had become Democrats. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2931.04s)]
*  And they started coming at it from the left and going like, well, Russia's they don't like [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2934.4s)]
*  trans people. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2938.16s)]
*  Did you hear that? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2939.52s)]
*  They don't like trans people. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2941.12s)]
*  They don't have a real housewives franchise in Russia. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2942.56s)]
*  They went at it from another way going like, we have to confront these countries, these evil [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2946.08s)]
*  people like Vladimir Putin, who are irrational. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2952.32s)]
*  They're not acting in their own self-interest. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2955.76s)]
*  They're irrational psychopaths that want to dominate the world, even though Putin's never [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2957.76s)]
*  showed any inclination of doing that one time ever once. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2962.0s)]
*  But he's going to. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2966.32s)]
*  He's 75 and he may or may not have Parkinson's, but now he's going to go and dominate the world. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2967.92s)]
*  Even though he can barely dominate the Ukraine after a year and a half of fighting, two years. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2974.48s)]
*  But they go, no, no, no, he's going to dominate the world. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2980.72s)]
*  And so the whole idea is basically just like they have to get back on that thing because [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2983.44s)]
*  Americans have lost the belief in that. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2989.76s)]
*  You can't sell that to people anymore. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2992.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear that. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2994.0s)]
*  What do you think changed? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2994.88s)]
*  The Iraq War. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2996.56s)]
*  I watched it. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2997.6s)]
*  I saw it. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=2998.4s)]

*  Friends of mine signed up for the military. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3001.68s)]
*  RIP to some of them. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3004.72s)]
*  A lot of them survived. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3006.08s)]
*  People watched soldiers dying every day. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3008.32s)]
*  They watched a lot of people get rich. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3012.0s)]
*  They watched the 10 counties outside of Washington, D.C. become the most valuable places. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3015.44s)]
*  You know, the biggest, you know, in terms of like net worth. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3023.92s)]
*  They looked at all these counties around D.C. and they're like, wait, what? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3027.84s)]

*  Or the Hill Country of the Texas. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3034.8s)]
*  We're talking about Virginia. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3036.88s)]
*  And people watched a lot of people get rich. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3039.92s)]

*  Like this type of all out conflict, it doesn't work. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3389.44s)]
*  And I appreciate Israel's position because it's a tough position to be in. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3394.1600000000003s)]
*  That being said, it's not going to work. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3400.0s)]
*  If we had TikTok when we were in Fallujah, it would have been crazy. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3402.32s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3406.8s)]
*  Just look at the stuff that got out about the, what is it called? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3408.4s)]
*  Which prison? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3414.0s)]
*  Zagreb? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3414.64s)]
*  Abu Ghraib. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3415.6s)]
*  Abu Ghraib. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3416.2400000000002s)]
*  With the fucking dogs? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3417.6s)]
*  That cigarette smoking girl, Lindy England, who now by the way works at a strawberry festival. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3420.0s)]
*  I found that out on my podcast. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3424.08s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3425.92s)]
*  Lindy England, the cigarette chain smoking cigarette girl who tortured those guys at [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3426.96s)]
*  Abu Ghraib literally was one of the sponsors of a strawberry festival. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3431.6s)]
*  I forget where, but it's absolutely true and you can check it and it's amazing. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3436.24s)]
*  And I thought, you know, everybody has a second act in this country, by the way. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3442.4799999999996s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3447.3599999999997s)]
*  Doesn't really matter what you've done. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3448.64s)]
*  Everyone has a second act. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3450.7999999999997s)]
*  OJ's on his third act. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3452.16s)]
*  Trump's on his third or fifth, sixth act, seventh act. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3454.8799999999997s)]

*  If you're still on the planet in this country, that's the thing about Russia. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3460.08s)]
*  They had to kill that guy pre-Gosian. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3464.24s)]
*  You don't get a second act there. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3466.08s)]
*  That's not the way it is. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3467.92s)]
*  They don't have the mechanism. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3468.96s)]
*  They can't give him a reality show. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3470.0s)]
*  Pre-Gosian doesn't get a game show. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3472.16s)]
*  They got to blow him out of the sky. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3473.6s)]
*  In America, like Hollywood would love Trump. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3475.36s)]
*  Now if Trump goes, I'm not going to run for president. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3478.4s)]
*  I just want to do a big show. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3480.08s)]
*  They would build him a fake White House in Burbank tonight and let him do it. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3481.68s)]
*  And they would all, they'd give him Emmys. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3487.2799999999997s)]
*  They'd pretend it was all good. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3488.96s)]
*  They'd hug him. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3490.72s)]
*  It wouldn't matter. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3492.0s)]
*  As long as he doesn't do the thing they don't want him to do. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3493.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3497.04s)]
*  I don't think he ever comes back. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3497.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think they ever let you back in. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3499.2s)]
*  Well, no, no, no. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3500.96s)]
*  Once they decide you're Hitler. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3501.6s)]
*  If he just said, I'm not going. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3502.16s)]
*  Well, literally we got George W. Bush. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3505.68s)]
*  Ellen's hugging him going, we love him. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3507.44s)]
*  And then people are going, he wasn't that bad. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3509.52s)]
*  He was much worse president than Trump. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3510.96s)]
*  Did much worse to America. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3513.04s)]
*  But I think if Trump just said, I'm abandoning politics, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3514.88s)]
*  Hollywood would be there in two seconds because they don't have any morals. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3517.6s)]
*  They're amoral. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3521.04s)]
*  So the thing about Hollywood, they don't care. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3522.4s)]
*  They're only thinking about what can make the money [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3524.6400000000003s)]
*  and what will get them in trouble. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3527.28s)]
*  The least. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3529.1200000000003s)]
*  But don't you think that in this day and age being moral, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3529.6000000000004s)]
*  or at least like signaling that you're moral is an important part of Hollywood [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3533.36s)]
*  that didn't exist before? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3538.56s)]
*  It can be and it is to a certain degree, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3540.2400000000002s)]
*  but they all know Trump is a fucking massive train of money. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3543.84s)]
*  They all know he's a train of money. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3548.88s)]
*  And if he just said, listen, I don't want to be the president anymore. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3550.4s)]
*  I want to host a game show. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3554.48s)]
*  There are people that Ted Sarandos is calling him. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3557.36s)]
*  And anyone that says shit about Ted, like he would go, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3560.4s)]
*  hey, what do you want him to be president? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3563.44s)]
*  I gave him a show. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3565.6800000000003s)]
*  What are you nuts? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3567.6800000000003s)]
*  He'd be in his Malibu house screaming like I gave Trump a show. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3568.56s)]
*  So I do think that there's a way back in. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3571.6800000000003s)]
*  They just they don't want him to be the president. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3574.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3576.8s)]
*  But they don't. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3577.2000000000003s)]
*  But he wants to be the president. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3578.2400000000002s)]
*  And he's going to probably be the president. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3579.76s)]
*  And he's probably, they don't kill him. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3581.36s)]
*  He's going to be the president. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3581.92s)]
*  It's going to feel interesting when he's inaugurated [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3582.96s)]
*  because it'll feel like we're living in a loop. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3585.76s)]
*  How far do you think they would go to stop it? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3588.0s)]
*  Because it's really wild watching him being prosecuted, right? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3591.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3594.48s)]
*  It's really wild. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3594.6400000000003s)]
*  I know for inflating the price of a condo, it's the dumbest thing ever. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3595.36s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3598.6400000000003s)]
*  They were like, he's an asset of Russia. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3599.28s)]
*  And now they're like, now it's totally switched to where they're like, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3600.88s)]
*  he said it had six bedrooms. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3604.8s)]
*  It has five. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3606.4s)]
*  It's like, guys, this wasn't what we were told. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3607.44s)]
*  We were told he was an asset of Russia. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3610.32s)]
*  And then they switched it up immediately to go, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3612.08s)]
*  oh, he inflated the price of his real estate. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3613.92s)]
*  By the way, everyone does that. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3615.52s)]
*  Everyone does that. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3617.2000000000003s)]
*  If somebody's appraising your house, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3618.7200000000003s)]
*  you walk up at the end and go, you saw the basement, right? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3620.8s)]
*  That's woodwork that I did. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3623.44s)]
*  Everyone does that. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3625.52s)]
*  He does it on a grand scale because he has more money and more properties. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3626.64s)]
*  But the idea that that's what we're getting him for, it's hilarious. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3631.28s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3635.36s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3636.16s)]
*  Because if this keeps going, how far will they take it? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3636.96s)]
*  If he keeps getting bigger, because it seems like, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3640.56s)]
*  at least in public perception, the more they come after him, the bigger he gets. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3643.52s)]
*  Because the more people realize the game, they're like, oh my god, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3648.88s)]
*  this is like banana republic shit. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3651.76s)]
*  You're prosecuting your political opponent. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3653.28s)]
*  And you're doing it specifically to time the trials around Republican conventions, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3655.44s)]
*  primaries, all these different things. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3660.08s)]
*  You're doing it on purpose. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3661.36s)]
*  It's pretty clear. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3662.64s)]
*  So everyone's more and more supportive of him than ever. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3663.76s)]
*  So how far will they go and how far can they go? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3667.36s)]
*  I think he'll run the joint from the can. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3670.0800000000004s)]
*  I think he'll run the country from prison. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3673.36s)]
*  I think he'll run it from the federal prison. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3675.6800000000003s)]
*  It might get to the point where we have the first mafia president, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3678.48s)]
*  where he's in federal prison in Palm Beach and he's running the country. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3682.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't think they'll kill him. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3687.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think they kill anyone anymore. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3688.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't think they kill anyone anymore. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3691.1200000000003s)]
*  They don't seem to. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3693.76s)]
*  They're torturing Assange. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3695.2000000000003s)]
*  They'll bleed you out slowly. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3697.2000000000003s)]
*  But they don't seem to be killing anyone anymore. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3700.0800000000004s)]
*  They used to kill everyone. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3702.7200000000003s)]
*  MLK, JFK, RFK, everyone died. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3704.0800000000004s)]
*  But now they're not killing people nearly as much. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3708.1600000000003s)]

*  People disappear. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3713.28s)]
*  Connected to the Epstein case. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3714.5600000000004s)]
*  They go. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3716.32s)]
*  They go. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3717.28s)]
*  They absolutely go. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3718.1600000000003s)]
*  Few of those guys went. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3718.88s)]
*  I take this off. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3720.0s)]
*  I think I'm allergic to it. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3720.5600000000004s)]
*  One guy. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3722.3199999999997s)]
*  The one guy that 30 miles from his house, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3723.6s)]
*  he hung himself in the electric cord and then shot himself in the chest with a shotgun. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3726.64s)]
*  That's right. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3730.4s)]
*  Or there was a guy in Palm Beach. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3730.96s)]
*  They found him in his pool. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3732.72s)]

*  Epstein friend. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3736.24s)]
*  He was in a pool. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3736.88s)]
*  There's a few of those. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3737.68s)]
*  They got to tie up the loose ends. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3738.56s)]
*  There's a few of those loose ends that had to get tied up. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3740.08s)]
*  They got to tie up those loose ends. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3742.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's a few of those. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3744.24s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3744.72s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3745.92s)]

*  Few of those. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3747.68s)]
*  But they don't go after the big guys anyway. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3748.24s)]
*  They used to go after the big guys all the time. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3750.0s)]
*  They don't seem to do that. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3753.36s)]
*  They have this prosecutor named Jack Smith. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3756.0s)]
*  Jack something. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3759.52s)]

*  It was, who was it? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3763.84s)]
*  It was Muller. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3765.36s)]
*  Muller. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3766.56s)]
*  And then there was another guy. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3767.04s)]
*  Everybody's, it's like he's the white knight. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3769.12s)]
*  Yeah, this guy now. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3773.2s)]
*  Jack Smith is the guy. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3774.16s)]
*  Everybody's put their hope in Jack Smith. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3775.36s)]
*  They had put their hope in. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3777.6s)]
*  This is Trump's attorney? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3778.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3779.36s)]
*  The whole thing. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3780.0s)]
*  No, this is not Trump's attorney. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3784.32s)]
*  This is the guy who's going at Trump. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3785.44s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3787.12s)]
*  He's the special counsel. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3788.48s)]
*  Oh, so this is the guy that's trying to prosecute Trump. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3790.48s)]
*  And they're basically saying like, you know, this is the one. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3793.68s)]
*  He's got it. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3797.84s)]
*  We've heard this for fucking forever. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3798.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, it's hard when you see the amount of crime [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3802.16s)]
*  that people are getting away with. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3806.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3808.72s)]
*  On the streets. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3809.28s)]
*  And then you see this disproportionate thing. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3811.28s)]
*  You're like, you're trying to put someone in a cage for what? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3813.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3815.76s)]
*  And you're releasing people when they just storm into Nordstrom's. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3816.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3820.1600000000003s)]
*  Run out with racks of clothes and smash. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3820.8s)]
*  That's right. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3823.28s)]
*  People justifying that. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3823.84s)]
*  And you're making laws so you can't prosecute someone [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3825.0400000000004s)]
*  for stealing less than a certain amount. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3827.76s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3829.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, and you're going to go after that guy? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3831.44s)]
*  For what? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3833.6000000000004s)]
*  Like, what is our goal? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3834.32s)]
*  Is our goal a safer world? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3836.4s)]
*  Is our goal a place where businesses can thrive? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3838.24s)]
*  Well, you want to be protected from Donald Trump's inflated condo price. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3840.0s)]
*  I mean, it's so crazy that the two things exist in the same country. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3845.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3848.64s)]
*  Simultaneously. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3848.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, you know. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3849.68s)]
*  Erosion. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3850.24s)]
*  Erosion of law and order. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3851.2799999999997s)]
*  If you talk to anyone in California, everybody knows somebody [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3852.64s)]
*  whose house has been robbed. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3855.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3856.64s)]
*  Home invasion. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3857.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3858.3199999999997s)]
*  Everybody knows somebody. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3858.72s)]
*  Scary shit. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3859.8399999999997s)]
*  Scary shit. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3860.64s)]
*  It's scary shit. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3861.52s)]
*  And yet they're not concentrating on that at all. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3862.16s)]
*  You know, like New York City's on a giant wave of crime. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3865.6s)]
*  And they're prosecuting Trump for this. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3868.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, they also have this insane thing where they're a sanctuary city. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3870.72s)]
*  So they have to take in all these immigrants. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3875.04s)]
*  But the president's son, and everyone keeps talking about this, they go, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3876.56s)]
*  well, he's being, it's a political witch hunt. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3881.12s)]
*  And I'm like, he has videos of himself smoking crack [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3883.6s)]
*  with Ukrainian hookers with gun to their heads. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3888.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3892.0s)]
*  The guy lives in Malibu and he has art shows in Soho. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3892.32s)]
*  He's doing okay. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3895.76s)]
*  Like anyone's life's ruined with one of the videos on his laptop. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3897.76s)]
*  Anyone. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3901.6800000000003s)]
*  They've done a remarkable job of minimizing the impact of that laptop. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3902.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3905.44s)]
*  They go, so what? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3905.92s)]
*  Yeah, he's, he had his problems. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3906.88s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3909.52s)]
*  They go, he had his problems. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3910.1600000000003s)]
*  Whoa, you have no compassion for addicts? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3912.48s)]
*  I'm like, he's in the Ukraine with a gun to a hooker's head, smoking crack [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3914.6400000000003s)]
*  with a job his father got him. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3921.6s)]
*  You don't have compassion for addicts? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3924.24s)]
*  It's a little different. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3926.96s)]
*  It's slightly different. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3928.3999999999996s)]
*  Can we admit that? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3930.0s)]
*  Well, it's also much different if we can find out that Joe Biden was involved. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3931.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3939.44s)]
*  The idea that he wasn't involved seems more unlikely. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3940.96s)]
*  Seems odd. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3944.64s)]
*  Seems weird. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3945.68s)]
*  Odd that they would just bring in Hunter. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3946.56s)]
*  It seemed like they had conversations too. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3948.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3950.96s)]
*  It seems like he said that they didn't. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3951.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a tough family. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3953.12s)]
*  But it's just imagine if that was Trump. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3954.56s)]
*  Just imagine the overall media coverage of it. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3958.56s)]
*  It would be insane. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3962.32s)]
*  Imagine how insane it would be of Donald Trump Jr. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3962.8s)]
*  Well, if Donald Trump was like, we should support the Ukraine, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3965.04s)]
*  everyone in the media in this country would go, fuck the Ukraine. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3968.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3972.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3972.56s)]
*  Anything he said, they just, it's, they run the other way. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3972.88s)]
*  But how crazy must it be for people like the CNN people that realized their greatest profits [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3977.04s)]
*  when they were having Donald Trump on every day? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3981.68s)]
*  But that's why they want him back. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3983.52s)]
*  Helped him get elected. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3984.7999999999997s)]
*  That's why I think they ultimately want him back. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3986.7999999999997s)]
*  They ultimately kind of want him back. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3989.6s)]
*  They've kind of engineered his comeback to a degree. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3991.3599999999997s)]
*  Bill Burr made a point, he was like, he was on the casino circuit [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3995.04s)]
*  and then everybody started inviting him and talking about him and now he's back. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=3997.3599999999997s)]
*  They like him. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4000.64s)]
*  They love him. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4001.9199999999996s)]
*  He was a creature of Hollywood in the media before he was a politician. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4002.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4005.9199999999996s)]
*  They did create him and I think he's, he's certainly not bad for business. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4006.48s)]
*  It's just wild how they turned. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4012.32s)]
*  Well, it's just wild to live in a time when we feel like we're almost in a, in an actual loop. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4014.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4020.32s)]

*  The Bushes, the Clintons, Chelsea Clinton run for president in 2020. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4025.6s)]
*  You know, and it's just going to be the same things. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4029.36s)]
*  And that's why you check out, that's why my dad is so checked out now. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4030.88s)]
*  And I used to think like, ah, he should learn more about store. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4034.0s)]
*  He shouldn't. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4036.88s)]
*  And now I've realized he's like, maybe the wisest person I know. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4037.76s)]
*  Cause his whole response, like at Thanksgiving, someone goes, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4042.56s)]
*  what do you think about this Israel thing in a Gaza? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4045.12s)]
*  And he goes, not cool. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4047.68s)]
*  And just kept eating. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4049.28s)]
*  And I went, that's his level. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4051.6s)]
*  He's got two or three words for any global event. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4053.28s)]
*  My father has at maximum four words to describe it. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4057.6s)]
*  It's usually like, that's not good. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4061.44s)]
*  And then he keeps eating. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4063.76s)]
*  And I'm like, maybe that's the move. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4064.96s)]
*  I used to say that I used to ridicule that. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4067.92s)]
*  I used to go, he's really out of touch. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4070.4s)]
*  But now I'm like, oh, he's lived through Vietnam and first Iraq war. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4072.96s)]
*  The second Iraq war, Afghanistan, Iran, contra the president getting his dick sucked. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4077.76s)]
*  You know, Obama, Trump, like I think eventually you just, you kind of just toss it. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4084.1600000000003s)]
*  You toss it in. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4090.96s)]
*  You decide that you're not going to get involved and you're just going to try to enjoy your life. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4092.56s)]
*  These young kids on Tik Tok now that scream about, they just yell about, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4097.68s)]
*  like there's a whole group of young kids who yell into their phone about politics. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4101.04s)]

*  You know, but they don't that level when you are a kid or whatever you are, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4140.0s)]
*  they're not kids either. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4146.56s)]
*  They're like young adults, but that level of certainty that you have about the world, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4147.52s)]
*  you never see the world more clear than when you're like 20. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4153.360000000001s)]
*  You know at 20 why everyone's a loser, why everyone's a winner, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4157.360000000001s)]

*  And so now we have an app where you can go on it and scream in the app and tell everybody [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4164.320000000001s)]
*  all the things you've figured out in 10 years of summer camp or whatever. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4169.84s)]
*  And you know, but what it really is, is you've never, you haven't lived long enough [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4175.12s)]
*  to have any of your ideas challenged in any real way. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4182.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4186.32s)]
*  You're also your brain's not fully formed yet. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4186.96s)]
*  Your brain's not formed and you want attention? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4188.72s)]
*  And you're in the middle of this weird culture shift where people are [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4190.96s)]
*  getting rewarded for yelling about politics on TikTok publicly where [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4195.28s)]
*  you would normally just kind of do it with your friends like you did over the Iraq War, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4200.4s)]
*  coked up with a cigarette. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4203.92s)]
*  If I had had TikTok back then, oh my God, if I had a TikTok back then, I was a guy where I was, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4204.96s)]
*  I would go over my friends' houses, I would hang out with their parents [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4215.68s)]
*  until like they would be working like shit little jobs. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4218.96s)]
*  This would be like the end of high school, beginning of college. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4221.36s)]
*  And I would sit there with their parents, they would make martinis and we would drink gin and [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4224.32s)]
*  we'd watch The O'Reilly Factor and we would smoke cigarettes in the backyard. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4228.32s)]
*  And this was like, you know, if I had TikTok at that point, it would have just been this sweaty, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4233.28s)]
*  disheveled coke head screaming about how Donald Rumsfeld needs our support. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4240.16s)]
*  Because that was, you know, I was like, you're not American if you don't. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4244.96s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4249.679999999999s)]
*  I just think about myself as like, fuck, I couldn't have been more wrong. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4250.88s)]
*  So I look at these kids who now have like the technology to broadcast every thought [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4253.76s)]
*  that they think they're having. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4259.92s)]
*  And I'm like, you're going to look back on that and go, that was so cringe. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4261.68s)]
*  When I was like doing Biden youth and screaming about the importance of Biden and how great he was, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4266.24s)]
*  even if you believe in Biden or think he's good or whatever, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4275.280000000001s)]
*  the way that they do it, they're going to look back on it and they're going to go, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4278.88s)]
*  oh, I was caught up in something. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4283.360000000001s)]
*  Because that's what I feel. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4285.84s)]
*  I go, I was caught up. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4286.8s)]
*  I didn't really, I read a few books that I didn't understand and I went all around Long Island [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4287.92s)]
*  screaming about the need to democratize the Middle East. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4295.76s)]
*  There's something about doing that on Long Island. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4298.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's amazing. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4303.200000000001s)]
*  It's so classic. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4303.84s)]
*  It was great. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4304.88s)]
*  And it was like, I remember being in the car with people. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4305.76s)]

*  Wait a little bit. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4330.24s)]
*  It's hard to realize why you're captured in like a way of thinking. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4331.6s)]
*  While you're in the middle of it and all your friends are in the middle of it [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4336.64s)]
*  and everybody's in the middle of it. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4339.04s)]
*  See, at least back then you didn't have social media. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4340.0s)]
*  So it's like, I wasn't doing it to be famous. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4342.64s)]
*  I was doing it because I was genuinely a lunatic. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4344.56s)]
*  I was a genuine lunatic. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4348.320000000001s)]
*  Now these kids go, oh, there's clout. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4350.72s)]

*  I got a bottle of vodka. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4358.0s)]
*  I got a pack of cigarettes. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4359.360000000001s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4360.96s)]
*  But you know what's ironic? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4361.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4362.8s)]
*  I think if you were on TikTok and there was all these other people doing it [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4363.46s)]
*  at the same time, if TikTok existed back when you were a kid, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4369.9400000000005s)]
*  you would still rise to the top. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4373.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, I like to think so. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4376.34s)]

*  I like to think so. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4378.900000000001s)]
*  Because a lot of this people getting attention that are mediocre, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4380.34s)]
*  it's just a lack of other content that's available. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4384.5s)]
*  I would like to think so. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4387.22s)]
*  I would like to think that there'd be people being like, do you watch that guy? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4388.5s)]
*  He's the guy. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4392.1s)]
*  That fat closeted gay cocaine addict who talks about why we need to do the Iraq war. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4392.74s)]

*  I'm like, what's the fucking motivation? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4510.120000000001s)]
*  What's the true story? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4512.120000000001s)]
*  When I came up in the world and understanding, trying to understand the stuff, there was [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4513.56s)]
*  cable news dominated the discourse. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4519.4800000000005s)]
*  So it was just the three networks, the big three, the papers, the Times, the Journal, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4522.120000000001s)]
*  the Washington Post, whatever. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4528.280000000001s)]
*  But then it was cable news. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4529.96s)]
*  So it was MSNBC, Fox News, CNBC to a much lesser degree, CNN even to a much lesser degree. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4532.28s)]
*  But it was Fox and MSNBC were the ones that were really propaganda factories. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4541.719999999999s)]
*  Fox was the right, MSNBC was the left. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4545.719999999999s)]
*  And that's what you had. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4548.5199999999995s)]
*  That's kind of still what you have if you're a boomer. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4549.639999999999s)]
*  But now the internet has just opened the gates of hell so that it's every idea and every [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4553.0s)]
*  permutation of every idea. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4560.12s)]
*  So you get some really good ideas and some really bad ones. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4561.96s)]
*  And sometimes they're all in the same package. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4564.84s)]
*  But don't you think you get a lot more of an understanding of what is actually going on? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4567.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4572.28s)]
*  If you're listening to Jimmy Dore. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4572.84s)]
*  If you're all over the place. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4574.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4575.08s)]
*  If you're listening to Breaking Points. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4575.4800000000005s)]
*  Of course. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4577.4s)]
*  There's so many different versions. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4577.96s)]
*  There's so much information. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4579.4800000000005s)]
*  It verges on too much. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4580.52s)]
*  Well, it can be. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4582.44s)]
*  It can be. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4583.24s)]
*  It's almost impossible to keep up if you have a full time job. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4583.88s)]
*  But I mean, it is much better than what it was when I was growing up and you were fed. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4586.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4592.28s)]
*  So Bill O'Reilly would come on and feed you a narrative. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4593.08s)]
*  Well, the fucking weapons of mass destruction narrative. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4597.24s)]
*  That's responsible for the death of how many fucking people? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4600.4400000000005s)]

*  Iraq didn't even make sense. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4608.68s)]
*  Well, it made sense for people that had a lot of money in it. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4611.4800000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4633.32s)]

*  preventing the type of information from getting to them that would make them go, hey, we're [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4765.0s)]
*  getting fucked over. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4770.200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4771.08s)]
*  But people probably know, like that's the thing that happened during Russia during the time of [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4772.6s)]
*  the Soviet Union. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4776.84s)]
*  I would talk to this dude who was Russian. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4777.64s)]
*  He said nobody believed anything that was on the news. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4779.08s)]
*  Everybody assumed that it was all propaganda, no matter what. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4781.320000000001s)]
*  The state news was telling them. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4784.599999999999s)]
*  They kind of had this like cynical perspective that they were trapped and this is just how [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4786.84s)]
*  it is. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4791.16s)]
*  I mean, I've said it before, but we're a country of believers. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4791.639999999999s)]
*  Like we're not that cynical. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4794.599999999999s)]
*  We actually do believe in the thing about these places where they control people. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4795.88s)]
*  It makes it very difficult to get creativity. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4799.72s)]
*  That's true. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4802.599999999999s)]
*  You don't get any funny because it's too dangerous. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4803.4s)]
*  No irony. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4806.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4807.48s)]
*  You don't shit about the wrong people. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4807.72s)]
*  They're going to fucking kill you. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4809.16s)]
*  They'll get you. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4810.04s)]
*  And you don't get any political disgust. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4811.08s)]
*  Did you hear about the show in Russia where it's like, let's find out who's gay. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4814.28s)]
*  And they literally put these guys in a house and one of them's gay. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4817.88s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4820.68s)]
*  And they have to keep kicking them out until they find the gay. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4821.16s)]
*  I mean, it's like hilarious. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4823.4800000000005s)]
*  But I mean, like that's the type of entertainment you get, like an authoritarian country. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4824.6s)]
*  They have gang fights in Russia. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4830.360000000001s)]
*  MMA fights where they have teams of 30 guys on one side and 30 guys on the other side. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4834.12s)]
*  And they run at each other like Braveheart. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4838.68s)]
*  And beat the fuck out of each other. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4840.84s)]
*  And then we're in different color outfits so they know who's who. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4842.28s)]
*  It is wild. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4845.56s)]
*  It's a wild place, man. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4846.4400000000005s)]
*  You got to stop. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4848.12s)]
*  You got to have a happy medium between that and let's have seven-year-old drag queens. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4848.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4856.4400000000005s)]
*  And this is the problem because we're not designed for balance. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4857.08s)]
*  The country is not designed for that. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4861.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4863.8s)]
*  And certainly the internet is really not designed for that. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4864.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4867.64s)]
*  The minute you acknowledge certain things and go like, yes, people should be able to pursue [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4868.2s)]
*  happiness as long as it's not at the expense of other people. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4873.96s)]
*  What tends to happen there is, you know, in freedom, you have a tremendous disparity [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4877.24s)]
*  between people that are going to abuse it. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4883.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4887.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4888.28s)]
*  And so then the answer for those countries is to give people very little freedom. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4888.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4893.96s)]
*  And to wrap it up either in religion or nationalism or whatever it is. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4894.36s)]
*  And then our country, we maybe go the other way where we tell people your self-esteem [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4900.28s)]
*  and your sense of self, you know, is at the expense sometimes of a cohesive society. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4910.04s)]
*  And that also becomes a problem. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4917.32s)]
*  So a lot of people now are looking at like, what are the limits of a liberal democracy? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4918.839999999999s)]
*  What are the limits of self-will completely run rampant? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4924.04s)]
*  You know, if everyone in society is thinking only of themselves, their own happiness, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4928.360000000001s)]
*  pleasure at every moment, how do we have a cohesive functioning unit? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4934.200000000001s)]
*  Though that is the struggle. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4939.4800000000005s)]
*  That's the struggle is like finding a way for people to be able to have freedom without [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4941.0s)]
*  infringing on other people. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4949.88s)]
*  And that doesn't seem to work because as soon as you give people freedom, they go, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4953.08s)]
*  you have to agree with me or you're fired or we'll take your kids away or well, whatever. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4956.84s)]
*  And that is what makes people throw the whole go like, fuck it. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4963.8s)]
*  No freedom. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4969.24s)]
*  You know, it's like the abortion thing. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4971.0s)]
*  It's like both sides of that debate have been in the trans thing. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4972.28s)]
*  They've both been hijacked by extremists. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4976.84s)]
*  There are people that believe that you should be able to get an abortion [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4980.04s)]
*  at any point during a pregnancy for any reason. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4982.52s)]
*  Then there are people that believe you should never be able to get an abortion. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4985.8s)]
*  Those are the only people we hear from. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4989.400000000001s)]
*  The rational middle ground just goes to work. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4991.64s)]
*  That's the problem with all these debates. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4995.240000000001s)]
*  We don't hear from sane people. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4997.64s)]
*  And if you chime in, if you have any sort of a balanced perspective or, you know, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=4999.88s)]
*  you're in the middle on these things, you're in the center. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5007.240000000001s)]
*  If you chime in on these things, you just get attacked. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5010.44s)]
*  You get attacked by the strongest forces from both sides. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5013.32s)]
*  And the most it's just very aggressive. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5016.5199999999995s)]
*  And most people want to avoid that in their life. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5020.28s)]
*  So if they do wait in occasionally and they get called out for it, you could get fired. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5022.759999999999s)]
*  You can get in trouble. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5026.919999999999s)]
*  They can contact your boss. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5027.719999999999s)]
*  You know that your employee is a this or that. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5029.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5031.32s)]
*  And they support this and they support fascism and they support, you know, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5031.639999999999s)]
*  and they're like, oh, I don't want to hear this. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5035.4s)]
*  We're going to start an email campaign to boycott your company and like, oh, fuck. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5036.68s)]
*  That's where everyone should choose, like really one terrible thing to be on the Internet. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5041.4800000000005s)]
*  And they get to be it, whether it's a furry or a Nazi. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5044.76s)]
*  You get to be like one thing. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5048.68s)]
*  You have to be one. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5050.360000000001s)]
*  You have to be one. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5051.160000000001s)]
*  You can't be everything. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5051.96s)]
*  It's confusing. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5053.4800000000005s)]
*  What would you be? [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5054.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5055.8s)]
*  I guess furry. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5056.6s)]
*  We're halfway there with the code. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5057.320000000001s)]
*  But I just think you have to, you know, it's like what's interesting about Caitlyn Jenner is [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5058.84s)]
*  trans person, also heavy mega, also rich athlete. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5065.96s)]
*  It's a lot for people. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5071.56s)]
*  It's a lot. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5073.24s)]
*  They go. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5073.96s)]
*  There are people that are hating her for different reasons. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5075.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5077.88s)]
*  There are people that love her and then hate her. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5078.2s)]
*  It's very interesting when you have those cross sections of person where it's like the trans [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5080.84s)]
*  people are like, we like her. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5084.84s)]
*  And then she goes, I'm against gay marriage. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5085.88s)]
*  You go, what's happening? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5087.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5088.28s)]
*  Like when Kanye put on the MAGA hat, I was like, hey, yes, what's happening? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5088.52s)]
*  He's had an interesting run. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5092.92s)]
*  I bet he bounces back with this new. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5096.44s)]
*  I bet he bounces back right now. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5099.24s)]
*  We're going to see a lot more high profile breakdowns. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5101.16s)]
*  Well, right now you're seeing more anti-Semitism you've ever seen before. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5105.0s)]
*  It's a lot of it. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5109.16s)]
*  It's a lot of Kanye said seems super mild. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5110.04s)]
*  It's super mild compared to what a lot of people say. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5112.76s)]
*  All he said was I like Hitler. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5115.32s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5116.6s)]
*  By the way, I love Hitler. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5117.24s)]
*  That's not even the worst of it. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5119.08s)]
*  I love everybody. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5120.28s)]
*  That's not even the worst of it. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5121.08s)]
*  Now, if your kids are only saying I love Hitler, you're lucky. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5122.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5125.96s)]
*  Count yourself lucky if your kids are only going, I love Hitler. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5128.76s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5131.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a lot of anti-Semitism now. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5132.6s)]
*  And it's a lot of people that are like, I don't know. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5133.88s)]
*  And I feel it's open. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5138.28s)]
*  It's open. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5141.24s)]
*  People are going wild. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5141.88s)]
*  Wild. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5143.32s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5144.2s)]
*  We've talked about it too many times already, but those hearings with that Congresswoman. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5145.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5149.8s)]
*  Was addressing the president. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5150.04s)]
*  Why doesn't anyone lie? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5151.24s)]
*  Why doesn't anyone lie? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5153.0s)]
*  Why didn't she go? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5154.68s)]
*  Nobody lies. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5157.0s)]
*  The fact that the president of Harvard can't lie scares me more than the discrimination. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5158.44s)]
*  I don't think it's a matter of that she can't lie. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5165.64s)]
*  I think it's a matter of she believes that those things are OK. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5168.12s)]
*  Ask me the question they asked her and I'm going to tell you what the right response was. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5172.68s)]
*  Does yelling death to the Jews constitute harassment? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5177.32s)]
*  I was in my office. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5184.6s)]
*  I heard them say I thought they were saying death to the blues. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5186.04s)]
*  I had no idea they were talking about Jews. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5189.08s)]
*  None of that's going on. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5191.64s)]
*  I don't even know what's happening. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5193.32s)]
*  I go to work every day just trying to make this the greatest country in the world. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5195.24s)]
*  And apparently people are yelling about the Jews. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5199.72s)]
*  I don't even, of course not. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5201.96s)]
*  The Jews are happy. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5203.96s)]

*  Muslims are happy. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5207.48s)]
*  The things you don't see are the Jews feeding the Muslims a lot because [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5209.0s)]
*  the Muslims making the hummus for the Jews. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5213.08s)]
*  You guys are seeing the bad stuff. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5215.08s)]
*  But we have, I mean, oh, we have Jew and Muslim dance night every Thursday. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5217.0s)]
*  Just make shit up. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5224.36s)]
*  We desperately live in a time of intellectuals and we need to live in a time of business people [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5228.04s)]
*  who cut deals. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5232.6s)]
*  This is again an argument maybe for Donald Trump. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5233.8s)]
*  Intellectuals are rotting everything with their double speak and their it's what we need is people [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5237.4800000000005s)]

*  People that come in and go you want something. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5250.52s)]
*  You want something. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5253.8s)]

*  There's a smugness to those people too. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5259.88s)]
*  That's bizarre. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5262.6s)]
*  When the one lady was what what university was it with a lady was smiling every time [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5263.88s)]

*  If it's actionable. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5272.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5273.24s)]
*  If it's actionable. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5273.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5274.2s)]
*  If it's actually if you are actually commit genocide. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5274.36s)]
*  Like what do you say? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5277.32s)]
*  Thomas Sowell, who's one of our great thinkers said the thing about intellectuals, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5278.28s)]
*  you wrote a whole book about it. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5282.28s)]
*  They never have to be right. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5283.24s)]
*  If you bake pies for living, if you are a contractor, you cannot put up a house and [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5285.8s)]
*  falls down. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5289.56s)]
*  You cannot poison people with a pie. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5290.28s)]
*  Intellectuals can be wrong all the time without consequence. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5292.76s)]
*  The only thing is that whatever they say has to sound good. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5295.64s)]
*  That's why these people at Harvard are sitting there making no sense because they know they [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5299.96s)]
*  don't have to be right. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5304.36s)]
*  All of the intellectuals in the early 1900s were all on board with eugenics. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5305.96s)]
*  They thought it was a great idea. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5309.8s)]
*  Only in hindsight was it like, oh, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5311.88s)]
*  all these intellectuals were on board with the Iraq War. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5317.96s)]
*  It's stunning. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5320.5199999999995s)]
*  Go find, go look at everybody writing. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5321.4s)]
*  People were fired from Chris Hedges, a journalist fired for giving an anti-war commencement [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5325.4s)]
*  speech. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5331.16s)]
*  Most intellectuals are on board with that. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5332.04s)]
*  Now they all go, oh, we're gassed at that. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5333.5599999999995s)]
*  So these people at Harvard are just trying to say things that sound good and they're not. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5336.44s)]
*  And because they know they don't have to be right. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5342.839999999999s)]
*  There's no consequence. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5345.719999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5347.5599999999995s)]
*  In the real world for what they say, as long as it sounds good, so they can say, hey, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5348.2s)]
*  it's about free speech. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5358.599999999999s)]
*  They don't believe in free speech at all. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5360.68s)]
*  But as long as someone goes, huh, that was a well-thought out, well-articulated point. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5362.599999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter what they're saying. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5368.44s)]
*  And, you know, I don't know. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5370.2s)]
*  Well, that's clear in those conversations. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5373.48s)]
*  Because they're saying nutty things, like if it's actionable. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5376.679999999999s)]
*  She's just dancing around answering. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5379.719999999999s)]
*  Just say no. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5383.24s)]
*  That's what I would have said. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5384.2s)]
*  Can we say we go with genocide of the Jews? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5385.24s)]
*  No. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5387.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's really bad. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5388.84s)]
*  I go, that's bad. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5390.12s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5391.08s)]
*  Who's doing that? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5391.88s)]
*  That's what I'd say. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5393.16s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5394.28s)]
*  What is the fear? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5395.8s)]
*  Is the fear that the students will attack? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5397.4s)]
*  What is the fear? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5402.28s)]
*  The fear is. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5403.16s)]
*  On campuses, I would imagine a lot of these progressive campuses, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5404.44s)]
*  the pro-Palestine sentiment is the strongest by far. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5408.44s)]
*  For sure. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5413.5599999999995s)]
*  By far. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5414.2s)]
*  For sure. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5414.759999999999s)]
*  And it's probably a problem when someone has a pro-Israel stance. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5415.08s)]
*  They probably get swarmed. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5420.679999999999s)]
*  These institutions now are fully, they've been captured. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5422.5199999999995s)]
*  It's institutional capture, meaning that they don't want to say anything or do anything that [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5427.96s)]
*  gives the idea that they are backing an oppressive entity. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5433.48s)]
*  The colonizers. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5439.879999999999s)]
*  The colonizers. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5440.759999999999s)]
*  The bad guys. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5442.04s)]
*  The colonizers are the big ones. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5443.0s)]
*  So they're like, we got to let people say whatever they want to say. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5444.36s)]
*  And we're not going to get, now we don't want anyone getting hurt. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5450.12s)]
*  Maybe we'll give them the benefit of the doubt. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5453.719999999999s)]
*  But they're also saying, we're going to allow people to say. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5455.5599999999995s)]
*  However, you couldn't say that about trans people. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5459.32s)]
*  Couldn't call for the genocide of trans people. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5463.0s)]
*  How about no one called for the genocide of Russians? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5464.6s)]
*  There was never death to the Russians. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5468.04s)]
*  That's kind of wild. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5471.56s)]
*  No genocide calling for at school. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5472.44s)]
*  But that is really wild, if you think about that one. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5476.68s)]
*  There wasn't a similar backlash against Russians. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5479.64s)]
*  Because Ronald Reagan said, what do you mean recently or when we had the Cold War? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5482.36s)]
*  No, even while this is happening recently, the Ukraine-Russia thing, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5485.88s)]
*  Russians are fine over here. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5489.96s)]
*  Like they don't have any problem. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5492.84s)]
*  Well, we don't view the Russians as a controlling party in our society. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5493.72s)]
*  There's a lot of people that view the Jews as the de facto rulers of America, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5499.64s)]
*  the controllers of America. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5505.32s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5507.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, and that's, I think, the reason for it. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5507.96s)]
*  I don't think we look at Russians as having that type of power. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5510.2s)]
*  Also, the scale of Israel's response in Gaza, it dwarfs everything that's happening. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5513.72s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5522.2s)]
*  I think it's not. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5523.64s)]
*  It's foolhardy. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5525.32s)]
*  I think strategically, it's going to be an issue because what are they going to do now? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5528.12s)]
*  They're going to have a security role in Gaza permanently? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5533.8s)]
*  And it seemed like there was some Kamala Harris talk where she was talking about a country that [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5536.84s)]
*  was going to rebuild it. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5542.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5543.72s)]
*  And they're in negotiations talking about rebuilding Gaza, which is like, hey, that's [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5544.5199999999995s)]
*  the fucking Ferris wheel. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5550.2s)]
*  It keeps spinning around. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5552.599999999999s)]
*  That's the Ferris wheel. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5553.72s)]
*  Just keeps spinning around. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5554.84s)]
*  And listen, I- [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5556.04s)]
*  Here comes the money again. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5556.599999999999s)]
*  Weee! [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5557.32s)]
*  I feel bad. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5557.8s)]
*  Money's going this way now. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5558.5199999999995s)]
*  Halliburton. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5559.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5560.76s)]
*  I feel bad for people that are victims of anti-Semitism, for sure. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5561.32s)]
*  And that's legit. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5570.44s)]
*  And especially people in colleges are probably getting the brunt of craziness. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5571.56s)]
*  But then there is also, you also have a thing where [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5579.4800000000005s)]
*  every criticism of Israel can't be anti-Semitism. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5583.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5587.64s)]
*  That also- [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5588.04s)]
*  Well, how about the citizens' criticism of Israel? [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5589.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5591.320000000001s)]
*  They were in the streets, hundreds of thousands of them for months protesting as a young- [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5591.56s)]
*  That's right. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5596.6s)]
*  So there is room and there has to be room to say the course of action we disagree with, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5597.08s)]
*  I think it's unwise for the United States to allow and fund an open-ended [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5603.96s)]
*  engagement in Gaza. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5615.16s)]
*  Open-ended. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5616.6s)]
*  Well, it's humanitarian. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5617.24s)]
*  You know, we need like two years, two months. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5617.96s)]
*  They're already saying that it might be beyond the tipping point of [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5620.84s)]
*  rebuilding. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5624.2s)]
*  They've destroyed so much. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5625.4s)]
*  Have you seen the footage, the recent footage? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5626.76s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5628.12s)]
*  Mosques. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5629.4s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5630.12s)]
*  Just bombing mosques, bombing buildings. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5630.92s)]
*  Their moment at what we did after 9-11 did not make us safer. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5634.92s)]
*  And I think they're having that moment right now where there's an understandable rage. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5640.12s)]
*  They are upset. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5646.12s)]
*  Hamas has their babies and women and children and every- [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5647.24s)]
*  What Hamas did was strike at the heart. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5652.6s)]
*  That's what terrorism does, right? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5657.240000000001s)]
*  You get to the core of a human being by saying we're going to rip away the things from you [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5658.52s)]
*  that you care about the most. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5664.4400000000005s)]
*  This is the emotional response to that. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5666.12s)]
*  I don't know how strategic long-term it is. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5670.92s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5674.4400000000005s)]
*  And I think it's unfortunately when you see women and children being killed that are innocent, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5675.240000000001s)]
*  we got to minimize that. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5682.6s)]
*  This is why when we have a modern civilization, the whole point of being a civilized country [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5687.64s)]
*  is to minimize deaths of innocent people and these types of things. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5696.200000000001s)]
*  Especially like that. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5701.88s)]
*  That October 7 thing, the fucking music festivals. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5703.88s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5709.56s)]
*  Terrifying. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5710.12s)]
*  I understand why you have a situation now where Israel is in a position where they're going, [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5711.24s)]
*  well, we can't live with Hamas. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5719.24s)]
*  That's not going to work. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5722.280000000001s)]
*  We can't live with them. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5723.96s)]
*  There needs to be some two-state solution. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5728.92s)]
*  When I grew up, all we heard was that. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5730.4400000000005s)]
*  They never materialized. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5733.0s)]
*  It never came to fruition. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5734.280000000001s)]
*  But then over the last few years, no one's talked about it and no one's cared. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5736.12s)]
*  I think it's become a situation where you have these elements, these radical elements [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5740.2s)]
*  in that society that are reacting to the very real and unending [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5746.679999999999s)]
*  unlivability of that situation. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5758.839999999999s)]
*  Gaza's unlivable. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5764.2s)]
*  It's not a livable situation. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5765.5599999999995s)]
*  The situation. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5768.52s)]
*  Then there's going to be people that are ultimately hopeless. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5769.96s)]
*  That's where terrorism comes from. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5774.280000000001s)]
*  It comes from people that feel like they have zero hope. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5775.8s)]
*  Nobody blows themselves up or engages in this type of activity because they feel like there's [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5779.160000000001s)]
*  a myriad of options for them in life. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5784.4400000000005s)]
*  They might be polluted with fundamentalist religion, but where does that come from? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5787.96s)]
*  It comes from the idea that if somebody came to me and goes, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5791.8s)]
*  I don't want to. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5795.320000000001s)]
*  I have a show tonight for law enforcement. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5795.96s)]
*  I got stuff to do. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5800.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't have the greatest life in the world. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5801.8s)]
*  I don't even have to say that. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5803.56s)]
*  I have a raccoon coat on. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5804.6s)]
*  But the point is I'm not going to blow myself up. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5807.4800000000005s)]
*  No young 19-year-old person should be at a point in their life when for a religion [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5811.0s)]
*  or a political faction or a government should be thinking of doing a kamikaze mission. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5817.88s)]
*  You do have to address the political conditions that create that level of hopelessness. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5825.320000000001s)]
*  You do. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5833.400000000001s)]

*  That doesn't mean that at every turn you're going to be able to convert people that if [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5836.76s)]
*  they just want to kill Jews, maybe they're just going to kill Jews. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5842.84s)]
*  You have to eradicate that threat. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5844.92s)]
*  But you have to address those political conditions that create that type of desperation in people [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5847.8s)]
*  that turns them to that type of violence. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5854.68s)]

*  That's part of the problem is that's kind of an open air prison. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5955.8s)]
*  That's a problem. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5958.92s)]
*  They're going to have to go to some of the other Arab countries. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5959.8s)]

*  But again, I don't want refugee. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5969.320000000001s)]
*  Like I almost I almost agree with them. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5970.52s)]
*  There's like I don't want refugees. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5972.52s)]
*  If my family started calling me going, hey, our pipes froze, I'd go. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=5975.88s)]

*  he would even say enough with the refugees. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6016.28s)]

*  We have floods of refugees. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6047.64s)]

*  It's economic migration. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6054.6s)]
*  And the reason is that a lot of these business owners and rich people benefit from cheap labor. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6055.8s)]
*  They want gardeners. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6061.160000000001s)]

*  But like they're building all these big, big towers in Miami. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6095.0s)]
*  How's that? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6098.2s)]
*  I'm not doing it. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6098.759999999999s)]
*  It's illegal labor. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6100.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6102.44s)]
*  Now DeSantis shut that down and all the construction projects are grinding to a halt [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6103.32s)]
*  because there's a lot of illegal labor being used in putting up certain buildings. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6109.16s)]
*  Really? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6114.2s)]

*  So how do you mitigate that? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6165.08s)]
*  So you think that's literally why they're letting everyone in? [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6167.639999999999s)]

*  They raided that African American unemployment dried up in the months after that because [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6240.12s)]
*  the Tyson chicken factory had to hire Americans. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6245.48s)]
*  So when these companies are forced to hire Americans and pay American wages, they do. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6249.639999999999s)]
*  But until they're forced to do that, they're going to rely on largely illegal, unregulated [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6255.959999999999s)]
*  labor. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6266.28s)]
*  And that's in their personal lives and private lives. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6268.12s)]
*  So if you can hire a landscaping company to come to your Hamptons house [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6271.32s)]

*  And again, I'm not saying like this is a great thing to do these raids and obviously [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6304.28s)]
*  there's human costs. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6308.36s)]

*  Is it because David Koch loves people from Central America or is it because he wants [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6324.2s)]
*  to drive down the cost of wages? [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6329.88s)]
*  He believes in a market rate and a market rate is hey, anyone will do it. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6332.36s)]

*  It just doesn't work if you import the third world to America. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6341.0s)]
*  That doesn't really work because then you're setting wages. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6345.88s)]
*  People on Park Avenue in Manhattan go, yeah, yeah, yeah, what does that guy want? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6348.36s)]
*  $4? [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6351.88s)]
*  Let's find someone to do it for $2.50. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6352.52s)]
*  So is this idea to try to compete with other countries that do this? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6354.28s)]
*  Like China? [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6359.240000000001s)]
*  That is one of the ideas. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6360.6s)]
*  The other idea is to get a ninth sailboat. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6361.8s)]
*  It's people that go, where are our profits? [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6364.84s)]
*  How can we maximize these profits? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6369.0s)]
*  What's the bottleneck? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6371.72s)]
*  How can we maximize? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6372.68s)]
*  How can we put up cheap labor bottleneck? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6373.56s)]
*  How can we put up a hundred houses for just the material cost and a minute labor cost? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6375.240000000001s)]
*  And what do you think about this? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6384.68s)]
*  There's a real, I think there's a bill that just got brought up [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6386.36s)]
*  where they're trying to stop these companies from buying up houses. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6390.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, BlackRock and all those guys. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6396.2s)]
*  And they're trying to stop them from doing that [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6397.719999999999s)]
*  because they think that they're controlling the housing market. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6399.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's pricing single family homes. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6401.24s)]
*  These are the big problem. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6405.88s)]
*  The big problem is single family homes. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6406.92s)]
*  So here it is. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6409.48s)]
*  Hedge funds have invaded the housing market. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6410.84s)]
*  A new bill would ban them. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6413.719999999999s)]
*  A sweeping new bill introduced in Congress would essentially ban hedge funds [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6415.0s)]
*  and private equity firms from buying single family homes. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6418.92s)]
*  There you go. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6421.72s)]
*  This is interesting. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6423.0s)]
*  Yeah, this price is out. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6423.88s)]
*  A lot of people. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6425.64s)]
*  You think they're going to vote on this? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6427.16s)]
*  This seems like one that's going to be very interesting to see how they vote. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6430.28s)]
*  It's going to be interesting. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6433.16s)]
*  Bill, which was introduced both the US Senate and the US House of Representatives on Thursday, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6434.12s)]
*  would over a 10 year period require hedge funds and large institutional investors [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6438.44s)]
*  to completely divest from single family home ownership. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6442.92s)]
*  Called the N Hedge Fund Control of American Homes Act, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6446.2s)]
*  the bill would require large funds to sell off 10% of their homes each year over a decade. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6449.32s)]
*  Well, basically what they want to do is create a nation of renters. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6457.72s)]
*  How do you feel about this, though? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6461.0s)]
*  How do you feel about a ban? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6462.52s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of people that own those houses that are not going to be happy with a ban [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6464.6s)]
*  because they want BlackRock coming in and giving them more money than the house is worth. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6468.52s)]
*  How much more do they give them? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6472.92s)]
*  They can give them 30% above. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6474.360000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6477.56s)]
*  Which is money. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6477.96s)]
*  And then they just lease those homes out. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6479.16s)]
*  And they lease them out. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6481.32s)]
*  It's part of this idea that home ownership and automobile ownership and all of these things [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6482.360000000001s)]
*  eventually are going to be replaced by more effect. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6491.56s)]
*  Whitney Webb is somebody I've had on my show and she's wild. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6494.04s)]
*  She knows her stuff. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6499.16s)]
*  Patrick David had her on and when she came on my show, she made a lot of great points about [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6500.2s)]
*  these legacy systems that people want to get rid of and they go rent a house, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6505.32s)]
*  use Uber, Lyft, whatever. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6511.16s)]
*  You don't need to own. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6513.639999999999s)]
*  What does owning do for you? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6515.0s)]
*  That's that famous article. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6516.679999999999s)]
*  You'll own nothing and be happy. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6517.8s)]
*  So I think the ban would sort of put the brakes on that, I guess. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6521.16s)]
*  The problem is a lot of these companies find ways around these bans. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6528.04s)]
*  You got to remember, these are the smartest people in America that become, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6533.0s)]
*  and I don't mean smart, like contemplative intellectuals. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6536.84s)]
*  I mean shrewd, effective sociopaths. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6540.5199999999995s)]
*  They're really adept. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6544.2s)]
*  When I say smart, I don't want people going, you think that? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6545.16s)]
*  I don't mean that. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6547.72s)]
*  I mean, they're very effective at gaming the system. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6548.6s)]
*  They're 10 steps ahead of all these laws that are being passed. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6552.2s)]
*  I'm not saying it's a bad thing to pass the laws, [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6554.84s)]
*  but a lot of these people are already anticipating that and then how to get around it. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6556.76s)]
*  I'm fascinated to see how that bill does, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6561.24s)]
*  because it seems like they would put extraordinary pressure [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6564.360000000001s)]
*  to make sure that that bill does not get passed. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6566.84s)]
*  They're not going to allow that bill to get passed. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6568.84s)]
*  It seems like you're going to find out who's on board. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6571.08s)]
*  Well, again, when RFK came on my show and called up BlackRock Vanguard, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6573.4800000000005s)]
*  I know we did it on your show too, BlackRock Vanguard and State Street, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6576.92s)]
*  these companies that own everything. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6580.12s)]
*  I got a lot of messages from a lot of financial people going, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6583.400000000001s)]
*  everybody's portfolio is tied up in that. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6586.5199999999995s)]
*  This is part of the whole issue with everything. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6589.48s)]
*  It's the Thomas Sowell thing. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6592.84s)]
*  There's no solutions. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6594.599999999999s)]
*  There's only trade-offs. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6595.48s)]
*  It's hard to get honest at this deep in the scam that is our financial system. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6598.04s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6605.8s)]
*  Any deleveraging, any winding down of the military industrial complex, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6607.4s)]
*  all of this will have ramifications in our society, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6612.2s)]
*  financially for people across the board. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6617.08s)]
*  I'm not saying you shouldn't attempt to do it, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6622.12s)]
*  but anything like this, you go, I don't like illegal immigration. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6624.28s)]
*  It's like, okay, your house is more money now. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6628.12s)]
*  They go, okay, I don't want Chinese people buying real estate. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6632.04s)]
*  Okay, well, maybe the real estate industry is going to take a hit, [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6635.96s)]
*  not only realtors, but people that work in that business, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6644.52s)]
*  property managers, interior designers, architects, [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6648.6s)]
*  people that stage homes, appraiser, whatever it is, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6652.76s)]
*  people might take a hit. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6656.76s)]
*  This is part of the issue of where we're at now. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6658.2s)]
*  You ban BlackRock and all those things from getting in there. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6661.64s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6664.4400000000005s)]
*  And then people will take a hit financially with their portfolios. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6665.32s)]
*  How many people have to vote yes on this? [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6674.12s)]
*  Like how many people are involved in this decision? [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6676.759999999999s)]
*  Well, it would have to pass two houses of Congress [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6679.24s)]
*  and then get signed into law by the president. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6681.48s)]
*  Now, that seems very unlikely. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6683.5599999999995s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6686.04s)]
*  Seems very unlikely because BlackRock will have a great argument [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6686.84s)]
*  as to why they're helping people. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6689.799999999999s)]
*  They'll get out there and they'll be like, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6691.48s)]
*  hey, man, we're here and we're buying these fucking houses [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6693.56s)]
*  and the people that we're buying them from love us. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6699.8s)]
*  The boomers love BlackRock. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6703.72s)]

*  One of the problems in the American real estate market [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6712.76s)]

*  They just won't. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6720.36s)]
*  They won't because they like to lord them. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6721.72s)]
*  They like to lord around them. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6723.72s)]
*  They like to make their kids feel guilty. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6725.320000000001s)]
*  They like to go, you could never afford it. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6727.56s)]
*  They like to tell you how cheap the house was when they bought it. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6729.56s)]
*  And then every Thanksgiving or Christmas, somebody will go, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6733.64s)]
*  pick this up for $200 grand. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6737.56s)]

*  But their last fuck you before they leave the planet [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6751.0s)]
*  is instead of selling their houses for, I don't know, a $900,000 profit, [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6753.4s)]
*  they just won't put them on the market. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6758.36s)]
*  Some boomers, which is hilarious, we read the articles on my show, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6760.52s)]
*  they're actually retiring to bigger houses. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6763.8s)]

*  And so that becomes an issue too of like, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6771.48s)]
*  you know, it used to be like you would have a house, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6774.52s)]
*  the kids would move, you'd stay in it probably for another 10 or 20 years. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6777.16s)]
*  And then you get a condo. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6780.2s)]
*  And you'd go, I'm out. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6782.12s)]
*  Fuck do I want to mow lawn for? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6784.28s)]
*  Now the boomers are going, this is the only thing we have [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6786.36s)]
*  that makes us truly valuable in society is that we own this like a McMansion. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6791.8s)]
*  And we're not giving this up. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6799.8s)]
*  We are taxpaying citizens. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6801.4s)]
*  And we are not giving this up. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6803.72s)]
*  And our kids are going to come here every year [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6805.5599999999995s)]
*  and they're going to suffer through the size of our house with nine empty bedrooms [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6807.56s)]
*  while they live in a two bedroom apartment. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6812.200000000001s)]
*  And we're going to chastise them for their decisions and their choices. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6814.52s)]
*  And the McMansion defines you and your car that you drive up to the [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6819.64s)]
*  That's right. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6823.080000000001s)]

*  Because they all bought those houses for very little money. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6832.6s)]
*  And they are going to hold them over everybody's houses until they are found dead in them. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6835.72s)]
*  They will not leave those houses until they are taken out in an ambulance. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6843.64s)]
*  The boomer, the most important thing for the boomer is to be right. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6849.8s)]
*  And that's their main thing. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6854.44s)]
*  They're not a soulful group. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6856.44s)]
*  They've been around forever, but they've attained very little wisdom. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6858.5199999999995s)]
*  It's actually kind of impressive. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6860.92s)]
*  The most American generation of people that have ever lived, they're deeply selfish, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6863.24s)]
*  self aggrandizing, paranoid, delusional. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=6867.32s)]

*  I think they're all really far, like years at light speed. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7345.5s)]
*  So we're not getting anywhere. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7349.099999999999s)]
*  It depends on what kind of propulsion system we have currently available. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7352.299999999999s)]
*  What we're using now is all we light things on fire and it pushes us forward. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7357.099999999999s)]
*  Like I was saying about the rocket ships, every time they go up, how much carbon are they burning? [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7363.34s)]
*  What the fuck are they doing? [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7367.9s)]
*  How much of that is it affecting? [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7368.78s)]
*  If we're trying to stop global warming, what are we doing? [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7370.219999999999s)]
*  Shooting rockets. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7373.42s)]
*  What's the big deal here? [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7374.86s)]
*  If they can develop some new propulsion system, and I think this is my theory. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7377.26s)]
*  I think that's what all this UAP shit is all about. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7382.86s)]
*  What's UAP? [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7387.34s)]
*  Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7389.58s)]
*  Gotcha. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7391.58s)]
*  It's a new way of saying UFO. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7391.74s)]
*  Gotcha. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7393.5s)]
*  When you're hearing all these disclosure talks and all this stuff, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7393.98s)]
*  I think two things are happening simultaneously. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7398.62s)]
*  I think it's highly likely that there is intelligent life that's aware of us [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7400.46s)]
*  from somewhere else and I bet they've visited and I would if I was them. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7404.3s)]
*  I also think that the government probably has in its possession some new form of propulsion [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7407.9800000000005s)]
*  that it uses for drones that is insanely sophisticated and above and beyond what we [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7415.34s)]
*  think is currently available. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7421.5s)]
*  Some gravity-based propulsion system. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7423.02s)]
*  And that's what a lot of these pilots are seeing. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7426.06s)]
*  That's why these things move in ways that no one has ever seen before. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7428.06s)]
*  That's why they can go into the ocean. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7431.5s)]
*  That's why they can shoot through the sky. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7433.02s)]
*  I think there's some kind of wacky drone that we've developed. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7434.38s)]
*  It's probably true. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7438.780000000001s)]
*  When they're telling you it's aliens, that's the moment I stopped thinking it's aliens. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7441.1s)]
*  I mean, it's aliens all the way up until the government starts talking about aliens. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7447.34s)]
*  That's a great point. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7450.700000000001s)]
*  You're all in on aliens and then when they're like, hey, it's aliens, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7451.9800000000005s)]
*  we're like, fuck you, it's not aliens. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7454.700000000001s)]
*  I'm like, no. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7456.14s)]
*  There's no way you're being honest with us. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7457.02s)]
*  Oh, we've just decided to be honest with you. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7458.860000000001s)]
*  For the first time? [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7460.700000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7461.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7461.820000000001s)]
*  If it was aliens and they did have aliens, they would say it was their shit. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7462.22s)]
*  They're just trying to, I guess you're right, just kind of see what this technology can do. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7465.900000000001s)]
*  Also, it's a great way to get people off your trail. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7471.580000000001s)]
*  If you just say, look, there's aliens. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7475.42s)]
*  We have no idea where these crafts are coming from. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7478.700000000001s)]
*  They're from other worlds. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7480.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7482.14s)]
*  These planets that can sustain life that are light years away, that we're unable to reach. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7483.12s)]
*  Let's find out where the closest one is. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7489.84s)]
*  Yeah. Where is this planet? [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7491.360000000001s)]
*  Where is the closest planet that's in the Goldilocks zone? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7492.400000000001s)]
*  They found that they had this one planet that I think they were trying to call it Earth 2 [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7495.6s)]
*  or something like that. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7499.84s)]
*  But it's theorized because we don't really have the actual ability to get to that planet [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7501.68s)]
*  and have high speed drones that get high definition video, see the atmosphere. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7507.76s)]
*  Did you ever see that? [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7515.76s)]
*  Which one of the alien movies was it where they landed on this planet? [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7516.8s)]
*  One of the more recent ones. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7520.96s)]
*  The nearest potentially habitable planet to Earth, 14 light years away. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7522.400000000001s)]
*  So if we can go at the speed of light, it's 14 years to get there. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7528.4800000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7533.6s)]
*  The planet more than four times the mass of Earth is one of three that the team detected [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7534.08s)]
*  around a red dwarf star. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7539.28s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7540.88s)]
*  That means if it's four times the mass of Earth, that means it's four times the gravity of Earth. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7542.16s)]
*  Right? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7547.12s)]
*  Doesn't that mean that? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7547.52s)]
*  Is that direct? [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7548.4800000000005s)]
*  Is it one to one like that? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7549.36s)]
*  I don't know if that's one to one because the Earth is, [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7550.72s)]
*  the moon is one quarter the size of Earth, but it has one sixth Earth's gravity. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7554.56s)]
*  It depends how big that wolf, one sixth one or whatever. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7558.400000000001s)]
*  And there's probably life on that planet. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7560.64s)]
*  There could be. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7562.96s)]
*  I would imagine there had to be something. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7563.84s)]
*  Well, depends. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7565.68s)]
*  I don't even know if we know what it's composed of. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7566.8s)]
*  Okay, it says a particularly exciting find because all three planets are of low enough [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7572.88s)]
*  mass to be potentially rocky and have a solid surface, potentially, but it also could be [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7577.280000000001s)]
*  a gas giant. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7582.56s)]
*  And the middle planet, Wolf 1061C, sits within the Goldilocks Zone where it might be possible [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7583.76s)]
*  for liquid water, might be possible and maybe even life to exist. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7589.44s)]
*  Yeah, we'd be talking about a 14 year journey at light speed. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7594.719999999999s)]
*  If we could go the speed of light. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7598.08s)]
*  And we can't go the speed of light. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7600.32s)]
*  We can't even come close unless these gravity propulsion systems are legitimate, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7601.28s)]
*  in which case you could kind of go anywhere instantaneously. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7605.919999999999s)]
*  The idea of this, the way it's been described by like people like Bob Lazar, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7609.599999999999s)]
*  who supposedly worked on back engineering these spaceships, is that it's like if you [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7614.4s)]
*  had a very soft mattress and you put an immense heavy bowling ball in the center of mattresses, [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7618.72s)]
*  push the mattress down. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7623.84s)]
*  So it like uses the gravity to push space time to that spot where it wants to be. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7625.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7633.52s)]
*  And then it unfolds again. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7633.84s)]
*  It sounds insane. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7636.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7637.12s)]
*  And it's beyond our comprehension, my comprehension. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7638.4800000000005s)]
*  It sounds totally like science fiction nonsense. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7641.280000000001s)]
*  But what is happening, I think, is that, I mean, you know, you could imagine if DARPA [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7645.04s)]
*  was talking about the stealth bomber and things like that, you know, the 70s or whatever. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7652.48s)]
*  Imagine what they're talking about now. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7657.44s)]
*  Eric Weinstein has some very interesting ideas about it. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7659.28s)]
*  He thinks there's a separate branch of physics that has been secretly working on things. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7662.16s)]
*  He points this one obscure university in New York State. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7668.24s)]
*  Hogwarts. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7672.32s)]
*  No, no, it's different. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7673.84s)]
*  It has an insane physics department, like completely unqualified physics department. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7675.28s)]
*  And it's also connected to this hedge fund that does like Bernie Madoff type numbers. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7679.5199999999995s)]
*  There's got to be something going on. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7685.28s)]
*  Listen, the things that we're unaware of are vast. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7688.4s)]
*  And also, there's probably a lot of these billionaires privately funding stuff. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7695.04s)]
*  The government's getting in. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7698.639999999999s)]
*  Everybody's kind of getting in. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7699.84s)]
*  That's kind of the book I'm reading where they're like, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7701.04s)]
*  they're trying to create fake people, AI people. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7703.6s)]
*  This is news network. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7706.96s)]
*  This is what they're doing. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7707.92s)]
*  And but they want to, you know, like, I don't know, it's all very creepy. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7708.88s)]
*  And none of it seems like it's all going to be good. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7714.4s)]
*  It's not stable. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7718.48s)]
*  When they were creating penicillin, we're like, oh, we get it. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7720.24s)]
*  You get sick. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7722.88s)]
*  Here's the medicine. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7723.6s)]
*  This is odd. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7724.88s)]
*  This does not have a practical application that tends towards, oh, that's going to be great. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7726.88s)]
*  It's not good for truth. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7732.64s)]
*  No. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7733.84s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7734.32s)]
*  The Sam Altman thing was really interesting to me because I had him on the podcast. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7734.88s)]
*  Open AI. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7738.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7739.6s)]
*  Very interesting guy. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7739.84s)]
*  And then he gets kicked out of the company and then they bring him back. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7740.88s)]
*  And then there was this talk that he wasn't straightforward. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7744.48s)]
*  And I, you know, many people speculated that they think that chat GPT has reached the standard to be [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7747.52s)]
*  considered a G like artificial general intelligence, a GI, which means it's alive. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7753.28s)]
*  It's when you just give this fucking thinking calculating and Sam Altman left the company. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7760.08s)]
*  Is it brought him back? [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7766.48s)]
*  I'm going to tell everybody about this and then they said, no, no, no, they kicked him out. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7767.92s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7771.28s)]
*  The board removed him and then brought him back on. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7771.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7774.24s)]
*  I bet something happened. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7775.2s)]
*  Well, the thing is that they were saying that he wasn't being forthcoming or something to those, [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7776.8s)]
*  you know, something that sounds like they know what's going on. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7782.4800000000005s)]
*  It's gonna happen. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7786.4800000000005s)]
*  It's happening. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7787.84s)]
*  It's gonna happen. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7788.64s)]
*  All the AI companies are moving in his hand friend. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7789.360000000001s)]
*  A lot of the big AI companies are moving in his hand friend. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7792.64s)]
*  Yannis Pappas used chat GPT to show that SNL stole from him. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7795.4400000000005s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7800.56s)]
*  He has chat GPT like that's it. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7801.92s)]
*  Like who, who popularized that term? [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7805.200000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7807.76s)]
*  And said Yannis Pappas use it for his character. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7808.240000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7810.4800000000005s)]
*  That's what chat GPT is doing. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7811.6s)]
*  Chat GPT said that. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7812.96s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7817.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, it's certainly a terrible time to be, you know, like one of these people who, [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7820.16s)]
*  you know, is paranoid. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7829.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7833.2s)]
*  Like I often think my mother passed away, but she was paranoid. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7834.32s)]
*  She was a schizophrenic. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7838.24s)]
*  Now it's like, are they schizophrenics? [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7839.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7842.56s)]
*  Or are they? [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7842.88s)]
*  Because if you are unduly paranoid now, oh my God, it is just a daily dose of fucking stories [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7843.92s)]
*  that are like, Jesus Christ. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7852.56s)]
*  And we've gotten to the point where Alex Jones, despite all his troubles, makes sense. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7855.2s)]
*  Not just makes sense, but a lot of people like, hey, what did he say? [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7860.32s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7863.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7864.16s)]
*  Now he's back on Twitter or X. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7864.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7866.32s)]
*  Which is wild. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7866.72s)]
*  He's doing it. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7867.52s)]
*  He's going to do a daily show. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7868.0s)]
*  Pointed out a lot of things over the years. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7869.28s)]
*  Some of them have been correct. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7872.0s)]
*  A lot of them. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7873.84s)]
*  A lot of them have been correct. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7874.5599999999995s)]
*  A lot of them. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7875.679999999999s)]
*  So you can't discount. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7876.48s)]
*  Now some of them aren't, but you can't discount what he says anymore as easily as you could have. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7879.28s)]
*  No, not as easily. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7887.36s)]
*  So much insanity has gone on over the last three years. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7889.92s)]
*  So many people like, what the fuck? [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7894.4s)]
*  The erosion of trust in everything from the government, media, church, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7896.5599999999995s)]
*  every institution we have has completely kind of collapsed in terms of how we view them. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7899.84s)]
*  And we now see how politically motivated they are, how corrupt they are, how criminal they are. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7904.88s)]
*  And now that we're just left in a world of individuals, some of whom are truth seeking, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7909.84s)]
*  some of whom are sociopaths, some of whom are funny, some of whom are whatever. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7914.799999999999s)]
*  But now we're just kind of left with a world of people trying to figure it out on their own. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7919.12s)]
*  And it's pretty scary. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7924.56s)]
*  Because some of those people are going to build cults and communes and everybody's going to drink [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7928.64s)]
*  the poison and they're trying to go find a hellbop comet. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7934.32s)]
*  And some of them are going to build media companies. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7937.2s)]
*  Some of them are going to build AI bots. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7940.0s)]
*  Some of them are going to build. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7944.16s)]
*  And some of them are going to come up with new religions. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7945.84s)]
*  I mean, but it seems to be now that everybody's operating outside of the institutions. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7952.08s)]
*  Yes. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7959.5199999999995s)]
*  And that the people that are still operating within the institutions [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7960.08s)]
*  are almost taking cues, all of the honest pop is like from people on the outside. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7963.84s)]
*  So it does seem like the institutions are rotting a bit. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7970.0s)]
*  They're trapped. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7974.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7975.04s)]
*  The institute, especially the media, they're so trapped in the television format. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7975.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7979.92s)]
*  That format sucks. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7980.08s)]
*  Well, it's just people not wanting to lose their job. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7981.36s)]
*  Yep. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7983.679999999999s)]
*  That's all it is. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7984.08s)]
*  It's people protecting their own revenue source. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7984.96s)]
*  That's all it is. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7988.88s)]
*  It'll go on as long as they can. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7990.32s)]
*  It's the most basic human desire to protect your family and your money. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7992.639999999999s)]
*  And that's a thing that no one ever thought was going to go away. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=7998.32s)]
*  And no one thought it was going to go away. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8001.599999999999s)]
*  And now it's going away and the pace of it and the pace of change is disorienting. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8003.04s)]
*  And people are like, what the fuck's going on? [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8008.0s)]
*  And now we're in the Wild West and the Wild West has its problems. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8010.72s)]
*  It has a ton of benefits. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8015.92s)]
*  We all know them. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8017.68s)]
*  A lot of information. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8019.5199999999995s)]
*  But then the Wild West has a lot of problems. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8021.84s)]
*  And it's deep fakes. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8024.16s)]
*  It's the AI stuff. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8028.0s)]
*  It's what is and isn't real. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8029.68s)]
*  What did and did not happen. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8033.04s)]
*  A lot of charismatic, cunning people are going to be able to manipulate this technology [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8035.68s)]
*  and rile people up about all manner of events that may or may not have happened. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8042.16s)]
*  Wait till they come with fake police shootings that didn't happen. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8049.28s)]
*  Wait till they just start manufacturing footage from something that did not happen. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8054.32s)]
*  And there's people in the street rioting about a thing that did not happen. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8059.52s)]
*  How far away from that? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8065.28s)]
*  A week? [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8067.12s)]
*  Because foreign actors could easily do something like that if they wanted to start some sort of chaos. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8068.24s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8072.8s)]
*  That's the type of stuff that you want to show chaos. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8076.72s)]
*  You could do stuff like that combined with a terror cell. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8081.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8085.68s)]
*  And dude, people wouldn't believe that it didn't happen. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8086.0s)]
*  They'd go, the government's covering it up. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8088.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8090.56s)]
*  They're saying it's... [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8091.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8092.24s)]
*  Well, there's so much confusion. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8092.8s)]
*  That's the big problem with not having a main source of information that's reliable. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8093.92s)]
*  That's right. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8098.0s)]
*  And then people have to search around a lot. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8098.56s)]
*  A lot of people don't do it. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8100.16s)]
*  They don't search around. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8101.12s)]
*  Just make it Infowars. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8101.76s)]
*  Just make it Infowars. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8104.16s)]
*  What's the worst that could happen? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8105.84s)]
*  If we got to do one, he's been right enough of the time. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8108.0s)]
*  He's been right more than CNN. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8111.76s)]
*  Just have it be Infowars is our national news. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8113.2s)]
*  That's our BBC. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8116.16s)]
*  I mean, if you think about what they did, [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8119.84s)]
*  you think about what these governments in conjunction... [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8122.400000000001s)]
*  He's back. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8125.28s)]
*  What is this? [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8125.360000000001s)]
*  He's back on Twitter. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8125.76s)]
*  Yeah, I was just saying that. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8127.12s)]
*  He's been tweeting all day. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8128.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he's back on Twitter. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8129.28s)]
*  But he also has a new show that he's doing. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8130.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8132.16s)]
*  At the end of the day, he's going to do... [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8132.4800000000005s)]
*  After he does his main show, he's going to break down [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8134.400000000001s)]
*  all the different things that they talked about. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8137.4400000000005s)]
*  What I'm going to do is when I'm on that next week, I'll FaceTime CAA all my agents and go, [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8139.92s)]
*  hey, because the thing is they can't even get rid of you anymore because they just need you to [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8147.360000000001s)]
*  sell tickets when you and him were on the podcast. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8151.68s)]
*  It was one of my favorite times ever. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8155.4400000000005s)]
*  It's one of the greatest things I've ever been a part of and done. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8156.88s)]
*  And I think it's like this iconic moment of like encapsulating the world at one of the wildest [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8160.72s)]
*  times ever before an election, before a contentious election. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8168.400000000001s)]
*  And it was... [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8173.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was an amazing time in the red pill. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8175.360000000001s)]
*  The old one. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8180.320000000001s)]
*  The old studio. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8180.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8182.08s)]
*  It was amazing. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8182.96s)]
*  It was fun. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8184.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8185.4400000000005s)]
*  It was a fun time. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8185.92s)]
*  It was a good time and he was great. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8186.8s)]
*  He was really sharp and really... [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8189.12s)]
*  The fucked up thing is how many things he was right about. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8191.36s)]
*  Like when he's talking about polio being something that kids are getting from this [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8193.68s)]
*  vaccine in Africa, they had to stop giving... [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8198.880000000001s)]
*  They're like, what are you talking about? [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8200.960000000001s)]
*  And he pulls up this AP story. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8202.08s)]
*  Like, holy shit. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8203.68s)]
*  Well, all the people that he calls out, listen, we always talk about this stuff, right? [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8204.8s)]
*  He infiltrated Bohemian Grove and stuff like that. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8208.8s)]
*  It's like... [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8210.88s)]
*  It's blatantly obvious to everybody that all of this secretive, you know, whatever you want [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8213.119999999999s)]
*  to call it, whether it's you want to say deep state or whatever it is, they don't want anything [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8221.599999999999s)]
*  they're talking about out there. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8229.679999999998s)]
*  The real rationale for the decisions that are being made, they don't want out there. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8232.4s)]
*  They don't want that out there. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8236.72s)]
*  That's why Harvard and Yale and these places exist. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8238.32s)]
*  That's why all of these secret societies exist. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8241.199999999999s)]
*  They're all groups that create loyalty amongst a group of very, you know, people that could [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8243.92s)]
*  be very powerful, certainly are usually very rich. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8248.8s)]
*  And they're just... [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8253.039999999999s)]
*  That's why all these things exist. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8253.76s)]
*  And then this guy comes around and breaks into one of them with cameras and shows all [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8255.84s)]
*  of those people in cloaks, mock sacrificing an owl or whatever, or mock sacrificing a child. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8260.8s)]
*  I think the effigy of a child with a big owl, you know, it's creepy. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8268.32s)]
*  It would be creepy if those people were all broke. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8273.759999999998s)]
*  Not only are they not broke, they're the most powerful people in the world. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8277.439999999999s)]
*  It's doubly creepy, right? [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8280.88s)]
*  Even if it is just a big orgy, whatever the hell they do, there's a lot that they don't [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8283.119999999999s)]
*  want you to know. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8288.0s)]
*  And the fact that guys like him are out there, they don't... [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8289.679999999998s)]
*  That is unsustainable. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8294.08s)]
*  They don't want that. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8295.76s)]
*  That's not good. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8297.599999999999s)]
*  I remember something I was going to talk about before, when you were on a rant. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8298.32s)]
*  We're talking about people existing in these AI realms. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8301.199999999999s)]
*  That this is probably... [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8307.92s)]
*  Are people going to get indicted for crimes that are committed in virtual reality? [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8309.76s)]
*  What I was thinking is these things are going to be run by the same kind of companies that [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8317.359999999999s)]
*  run YouTube. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8322.8s)]
*  Now imagine the restrictions that YouTube puts on content. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8324.96s)]
*  YouTube would take you off if you had anything that didn't go with the COVID narrative. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8329.119999999999s)]
*  They'll take you off if you have anything that doesn't go with the gender narrative. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8333.679999999998s)]
*  They'll demonetize you. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8337.199999999999s)]
*  They'll limit your reach. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8338.48s)]
*  They'll shadow ban you. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8339.439999999999s)]
*  They'll do whatever the fuck they want. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8340.48s)]
*  Now imagine if that is life. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8341.76s)]
*  Imagine if most life now takes place in some sort of a digital realm that's owned by a [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8343.92s)]
*  corporation. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8348.640000000001s)]
*  And then that corporation decides to impose its ideology on all the people that exist in [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8349.52s)]
*  that realm. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8356.24s)]
*  Well, it's also like one of the things that was interesting in this book was when does [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8357.68s)]
*  a crime start? [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8362.400000000001s)]
*  This is very interesting. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8364.800000000001s)]
*  Was it thought with a thought? [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8366.480000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8367.68s)]
*  At what point does a crime stop it? [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8368.800000000001s)]
*  Because we have all this metadata showing kind of what you want. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8371.2s)]
*  We can create a composite of you and what you're thinking about. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8375.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8377.76s)]
*  When can we stop it? [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8378.400000000001s)]
*  These are all very interesting things that are going to come up that are coming up right [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8380.400000000001s)]
*  now. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8385.04s)]
*  And these are debates that are going to have to be had as more and more of our life exists [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8385.92s)]
*  on these virtual platforms. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8390.960000000001s)]
*  This is only the beginning, right? [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8393.28s)]
*  Like we're still in the infancy of like what this is all going to look like. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8394.880000000001s)]
*  I don't think we can even guess. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8399.92s)]
*  I think it's going to be so fucking bizarre, so quick. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8402.56s)]
*  And the thing is if we get hit by something like whatever took out the ancient Egyptians [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8406.08s)]
*  and civilization, if we get hit by something, there will be no evidence. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8410.8s)]
*  There'll be everything's going to be on hard drives. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8415.12s)]
*  That's right. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8417.44s)]
*  You're never going to get it. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8417.92s)]
*  That's right. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8419.2s)]
*  No one's going to know what the fuck Aristotle said. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8419.68s)]
*  No one's going to know. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8422.4s)]
*  Someone wore this coat. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8423.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8425.36s)]
*  They're going to find this coat. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8425.76s)]
*  They're going to go, they were wearing this. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8426.88s)]
*  He had a spear and he wore that and he hunted seals. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8429.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8432.0s)]
*  Little did they know. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8432.560000000001s)]
*  They're never going to read the work of Feynman. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8433.52s)]
*  It's all going to be gone. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8435.36s)]
*  The books are going to be incinerated. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8436.240000000002s)]
*  It'll all be hard drives will be rotted out and we're going to have to do it all over again. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8437.92s)]
*  And I think that's what they did. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8442.240000000002s)]
*  I think that's what people, when you look at ancient Greece, I think those are the people [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8443.52s)]
*  doing it all over again. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8447.2s)]
*  And I think the real people that did it at the first were the Egyptians and whoever was [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8448.400000000001s)]
*  around at that time that didn't have those insane monuments. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8453.04s)]
*  But what we know that they did, that's like the best evidence you could ever have in front [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8456.56s)]
*  of your face. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8461.439999999999s)]
*  There's a piece of this puzzle that's missing. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8461.92s)]
*  Definitely a big piece of the puzzle that's missing. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8465.519999999999s)]
*  And it is interesting to think about because, you know, it's about 2024. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8467.84s)]
*  If you look back at 2014 and look at the changes to our society in 10 years, [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8476.56s)]
*  um, expedited by the pandemic and things like that, right? [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8484.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8489.2s)]
*  You imagine 2034, it's going to get wild. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8491.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8495.92s)]
*  It's going to get wild. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8496.800000000001s)]
*  What is that going to be like? [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8497.28s)]
*  Is it going to be where me and you are able to meet for coffee in a virtual world of our choosing? [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8499.36s)]
*  Most certainly. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8506.64s)]
*  That's already happening. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8507.6s)]
*  That's already happening. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8508.880000000001s)]
*  That's already happening. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8509.68s)]
*  The Lex Friedman Mark Zuckerberg podcast they did. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8510.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8514.16s)]
*  It was insane. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8514.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8515.359999999999s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8515.68s)]
*  They look exactly like them and it's just avatars talking, [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8516.64s)]
*  like eye movement, lip movement, everything. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8520.32s)]
*  They're wearing these goggles. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8522.64s)]
*  So that seems to be coming. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8524.32s)]
*  That's a hundred percent coming. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8526.24s)]
*  It's going to streamline. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8527.439999999999s)]
*  It's going to be small and then it's eventually going to be in your body. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8528.48s)]
*  And then when it's in your body, you're going to have the ability to be anywhere at any time [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8531.84s)]
*  you want and not really where you are. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8535.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8538.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8538.720000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's inevitable. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8538.960000000001s)]
*  And then also communication with people of all these different languages instantaneously. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8541.36s)]
*  We'll have either we'll have a universal language or we'll have instantaneous translation [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8547.76s)]
*  to the language of your choice and there'll be no confusion anymore. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8553.92s)]
*  It's going to feel silly that we were debating whether the background actor [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8556.64s)]
*  who was a hot dog guy could be reproduced without his consent. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8560.800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8565.199999999999s)]
*  And I understand why we got to have all those discussions, [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8565.759999999998s)]
*  but things are going to get so crazy that we're going to look back at that goal. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8567.919999999998s)]
*  That was quaint. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8571.519999999999s)]
*  They're doing this. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8572.48s)]
*  There's a dam and it's leaking and they're doing this with their fingers. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8573.439999999999s)]
*  It's not enough that things going to come down. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8576.4s)]
*  And I don't think there's anything we could do about it. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8578.64s)]
*  I think A.I. actors are inevitable. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8580.88s)]
*  A.I. films that are amazing, that are entirely designed, written, performed by A.I. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8584.24s)]
*  I think it's inevitable. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8591.919999999998s)]
*  And I think when the first one comes out, that's a fucking banger. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8592.88s)]
*  We're going to be all on board because you can fail with this. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8595.759999999998s)]
*  Jamie, have you seen this commercial going around? [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8598.72s)]
*  No. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8600.48s)]
*  I'll play it for you. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8601.519999999999s)]
*  It's pretty interesting. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8602.4s)]
*  A.I. pin. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8603.519999999999s)]
*  You've seen on TV a lot over the last few days. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8604.4s)]
*  So it's a pin you carry with you instead of having a cell phone. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8606.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8609.119999999999s)]
*  You wear this. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8609.359999999999s)]
*  He's a knife about what we experience. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8609.839999999998s)]
*  There's multiple companies that do that right now. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8611.839999999998s)]
*  Can I eat this? [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8613.92s)]
*  Yes. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8615.039999999999s)]
*  Dragon fruits are low in sugar. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8615.439999999999s)]
*  What we hear. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8617.279999999999s)]
*  Hey, what should I get here? [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8618.48s)]
*  What we see. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8623.679999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8625.759999999998s)]
*  So this is sort of like right. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8626.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8627.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8628.56s)]
*  That would be nicer if that was embedded in your wrist. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8628.72s)]
*  Just give me the chip. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8631.679999999998s)]
*  And by the way, human to human experiences when it comes to customer service and things [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8633.039999999999s)]
*  like that, they've been declining because everyone's so used to the internet. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8638.4s)]
*  People are like person to person. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8641.599999999999s)]
*  You walk into a store now, people are running away from you. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8644.4s)]
*  They don't want to help you. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8647.599999999999s)]
*  It's better. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8648.8s)]
*  Let's just do this. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8649.359999999999s)]
*  So she said play songs from last time we were here. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8652.88s)]
*  It's recording stuff all day. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8657.119999999999s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8660.0s)]
*  Translating it and putting in some sort of files that can go and reference it. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8661.199999999999s)]
*  Oh, the NSA is going to get you. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8663.92s)]
*  You could ask it to recall stuff. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8666.32s)]
*  What was what was Tim saying yesterday at two o'clock? [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8667.519999999999s)]
*  Oh, well, don't do that. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8669.599999999999s)]
*  Don't do that. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8671.599999999999s)]
*  Fun, fun, fun time. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8672.4s)]
*  Two o'clock was a rough hour. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8673.279999999999s)]
*  There will be no more secrets. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8674.88s)]
*  No, there will be mind reading will be everywhere. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8676.4s)]
*  You will never get away from your thoughts. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8679.84s)]
*  Other people reading your thoughts. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8682.880000000001s)]
*  Everyone's going to know how much money you make, where you live, everything about you. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8684.4s)]
*  It's going to get fucking squirrely. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8689.36s)]
*  It's your life, but for everyone. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8692.16s)]
*  It's like a life of a celebrity where people know those things. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8693.76s)]
*  But way more. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8696.960000000001s)]
*  They will know your thoughts. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8697.92s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be every moment. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8699.28s)]
*  It'll be intrusive. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8701.2s)]
*  Intrusive. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8702.08s)]
*  I mean, there's going to be people that decide to opt out and shut it off. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8702.880000000001s)]
*  But then I guarantee you that people are not going to be able to go to the Christmas [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8706.08s)]
*  village like it's going to be the holiday village. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8709.52s)]
*  You probably can't fly. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8712.24s)]
*  Yeah, unless you have a chip. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8713.44s)]
*  They're not going to let you do it. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8714.32s)]
*  I want to know if you're a terrorist. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8715.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8717.28s)]
*  You can't fly in this plane. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8718.08s)]
*  What if I think you're going to take over the cockpit? [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8719.36s)]
*  We're going to live in a time of certainty. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8721.84s)]
*  And that's going to be scary because it does kind of take some of the romance [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8724.48s)]
*  interest, like some of the excitement out of life is knowing everything. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8728.0s)]
*  And in the middle of all that, that's when AI is going to just start running shit. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8731.84s)]
*  And start going, get out, get ready. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8735.84s)]
*  Isn't the fun of sitting across the table from somebody going, what's that guy or woman? [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8737.36s)]
*  Like, what are they about? [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8742.32s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8743.44s)]
*  There's something interesting. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8743.92s)]
*  Obviously. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8745.28s)]
*  Interesting about it. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8745.76s)]
*  You've done it more than anyone. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8746.560000000001s)]
*  Like to me, it's like if we just live in a world where everybody's thoughts are kind of available, [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8748.24s)]
*  it's good. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8756.720000000001s)]
*  It seems like. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8757.28s)]
*  I think it's common, man. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8759.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no, I don't doubt it. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8760.24s)]
*  I don't think we can stop it. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8761.6s)]
*  And I think it's going to be the thing that transcends us. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8762.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8765.68s)]
*  The thing that moves us from what we are now into what we're going to become. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8765.84s)]
*  I think it's going to happen technologically. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8770.64s)]
*  I don't think it's going to happen biologically. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8772.64s)]
*  Put a year on it. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8774.32s)]
*  2030? [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8775.2s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8775.92s)]
*  I don't even think we have that much time. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8776.16s)]
*  I think we have a couple of years. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8778.16s)]
*  I think we have a couple of years before things get real strange because I think artificial [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8779.6s)]
*  general intelligence is going to emerge. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8783.2s)]
*  And when they start implementing it and if they decide to implement it in government, [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8785.2s)]
*  that's when things are going to get really crazy. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8789.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8791.12s)]
*  If they can figure out a way to stop corruption through artificial intelligence, [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8791.44s)]
*  who's not going to be on board? [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8795.36s)]
*  If artificial intelligence can make all transactions completely equitable and fair [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8796.640000000001s)]
*  and morally just and righteous and make an even distribution of government finance, [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8801.28s)]
*  take care of all the complex problems. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8806.24s)]
*  Well, that's when they'll shut it down. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30y-HWipWOQ&t=8807.92s)]
