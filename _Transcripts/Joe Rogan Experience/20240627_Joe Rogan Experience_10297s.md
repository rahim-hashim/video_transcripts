# Joe Rogan Experience #1900 - Steve-O
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6.0s)]
*  And we're up Steve-o. What's happening my brother? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10.0s)]
*  Yeah dude. Good to see you. Good to see you too man. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=17.0s)]
*  It's been a long time. Every time I see you I'm just happy you're in One Piece. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=20.0s)]
*  Just happy while everything's working. Yeah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=24.0s)]
*  I can't believe it that all the people that have gotten fucked up doing the things that you do, you're out there fucking moving around like normal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=27.0s)]
*  Right. I'm thriving. And it hasn't been so long. I see you at the fights all the time. Yeah. All the time. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=33.0s)]
*  Yeah. Man it's crazy the, I just got so hooked on that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=39.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's the most exciting live experience you could ever encounter. For sure. I really believe that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=44.0s)]
*  And dude how about this last card? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=51.0s)]
*  I think it was one of the most first round knockouts ever. Seven. Yeah. It was pretty crazy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=54.0s)]
*  First round stoppages. It was a wild card man. Wild card. Yeah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=61.0s)]
*  I was on an airplane at the time that it was happening. And you know a lot of the time I'm on stage doing my show when the fights are happening. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=67.0s)]
*  And in those situations like I will move my Instagram app off the like front screen of my phone. So you can't see? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=77.0s)]
*  Yeah because I'll just inadvertently like just because it's like muscle memory. I'll open Instagram and when it opens I'll like no. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=87.0s)]
*  Like I'll find out what happened. So I'll move my fucking Instagram off the top page and then you know like just make sure that I don't find anything out. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=93.0s)]
*  And then I'll go under the video on demand after the fact and watch it all. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=104.0s)]
*  Yeah the wifi on a plane is not quite good enough right? You can't really stream it on a plane can you? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=108.0s)]
*  In some cases like YouTube will work fine sometimes. But in this case I was on an Air Canada flight so I didn't even have wifi. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=114.0s)]
*  It's wood powered wifi. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah and when they made the move to ESPN plus, ESPN, it was driving me crazy because I'd get back to my hotel room after my shows. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=127.0s)]
*  And I'd go to the on demand and the thumbnail for the event would be a guy like celebrating. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=142.0s)]
*  I'm like the whole fucking reason that I'm here is because anybody go into the video on demand and the thumbnail would give it away. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=153.0s)]
*  So I messaged Dane and I'm like dude this is driving me crazy. And he's like I got the number one at ESPN, the number two at Disney's on it and then it just got fixed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=161.0s)]
*  Oh really? You fixed it? Congratulations. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=176.0s)]
*  Thanks man. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=180.0s)]
*  It's actually a very wise solution. You really shouldn't have that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=181.0s)]
*  Because everybody who doesn't get a chance to see it live, they want to go to it and just watch it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=185.0s)]
*  Right. Now the remaining problem is that they break out all the fights individually. So you see the duration. There's a little time code. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=190.0s)]
*  That's an issue yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=203.0s)]
*  Yeah so you know if it... [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=204.0s)]
*  You just gotta not look at that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=207.0s)]
*  Right. I blur my eyes like. But yeah it's crazy man. I'm a super fan dude. I literally watch every fight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=208.0s)]
*  Yeah obviously I'm a giant fan. That stylebender fight. How crazy was that? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=219.0s)]
*  Really crazy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=224.0s)]
*  Dude the way he responded to that loss is better than anybody ever. The dude shows up at the press conference with a fucking fur coat like a king. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=225.0s)]
*  With his dope ass watch on and just says he got me. You know? I mean he basically said the hunter is now the hunted. I'm coming after him. I'm gonna find a way to beat that dude. I was on my way to beating him and he got me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=234.0s)]
*  And he was honest about all of it. About how Pahara landed a bunch of calf kicks early on and it fucked up his leg and couldn't move right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=247.0s)]
*  Perennial nerves. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=255.0s)]
*  Yeah so those calf kicks have changed the fucking game. I can't believe... I was talking to Michael Bisping who was UFC champion and he said that literally he got through his entire career before the calf kick came along. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=257.0s)]
*  Which is so wild when you think about that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=270.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=273.0s)]
*  I mean he got through his whole career before the calf kick emerged. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=274.0s)]
*  Which is insane to think of. That this one area of the leg to kick. The only person that had ever really done it before that was Benson Henderson was pretty good at doing that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=280.0s)]
*  And Mighty Mouse had done it. To Henry Sohuto. And it happened to Michael Chandler and Bellator. But it wasn't like a staple. Like everybody had to do it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=290.0s)]
*  And now everyone has to do it. And it just takes like one or two shots and your leg is fucked. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=300.0s)]
*  Yeah. And with the stoppage too on this Izzy fight. I thought... it wasn't a bad stoppage. But at the same time it was impressive how Izzy said... [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=306.0s)]
*  In the moment I thought it was a bad stoppage. But then my coach and my manager they said it was fine and I trust them and so it's all good. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=322.0s)]
*  Well I don't think Pahira was going to stop. He had more time. Izzy was stationary and Pahira was going to hit him some big shots. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=334.0s)]
*  We don't need to see Izzy with his eyes rolled back behind his head flat out unconscious. I think it was a good stoppage. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=343.0s)]
*  I agree. I agree that it was a good stoppage. And I can see where Izzy would be upset about it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=351.0s)]
*  I can see where he would be upset about it too. And I can see where other fights have gone on longer. And they have. But it's a subjective call. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=361.0s)]
*  And Mark Goddard is one of the very best in the world. He's top two or three. He might be number two. I think Herb Dean is number one. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=368.0s)]
*  And Big John McCarthy doesn't ref anymore. He was always in that same spot. There's a few guys that are the elite of the elite of referees. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=377.0s)]
*  And Mark Goddard is surely right there. Very few bad calls or even questionable calls. I don't think I've ever seen him make a bad call. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=385.0s)]
*  Right. To your point I think that Izzy just handled that... [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=393.0s)]
*  Like a fucking king. Like a king. You know? And he was saying bring back Steve Mazzagati. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=397.0s)]
*  Because Steve Mazzagati was a referee that was famous for letting fights go way too long. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=405.0s)]
*  Oh that. That was like in Brazil. Was that him? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=411.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know which fight you're talking about. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=417.0s)]
*  Yeah there was some really really bad one. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=420.0s)]
*  Well I think that was Mario Yamasaki who he was talking about. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=423.0s)]
*  He doesn't do them for the UFC anymore either. But Mazzagati was kind of famous for that. For whatever reason. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=427.0s)]
*  Whether it's justified or not. But it was just hilarious that Izzy was saying bring back Steve Mazzagati. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=433.0s)]
*  And then he went on Andrew Schultz's podcast on Monday. So he was on Schultz's podcast Monday. They were drinking, having fun. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=439.0s)]
*  He handled it very very well. Ben Askren has handled defeat very well too. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=448.0s)]
*  Yes he did. Especially that one to Jorge Masvidal. Because that was a crazy one. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=454.0s)]
*  It's fucking the game they play man. Izzy knocked a lot of fucking people unconscious. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=459.0s)]
*  Izzy put it on everybody in the division. And the thing is when you are a specialist. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=468.0s)]
*  Like if your specialty is wrestling and then all of a sudden you're facing an Olympic gold medalist. You're like fuck. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=475.0s)]
*  Because there's people that are better than you at your specialty. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=480.0s)]
*  And at least on paper Alex Pahara is one of the best kickboxers of all time. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=484.0s)]
*  I still think Izzy is technically a better striker. Because Izzy is just so clever and sophisticated. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=492.0s)]
*  And he doesn't have the kind of power that Pahara has. But Pahara is very technically good too. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=501.0s)]
*  He just has a different thing that he relies on. He just has that nuclear option. And he relies on that a lot. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=509.0s)]
*  And it paid off. And it paid off with him against Izzy twice. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=516.0s)]
*  And one time he won by a decision which if I go back and watch that kickboxing fight I do not agree with that decision. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=522.0s)]
*  And the second fight with kickboxing it was a kind of shady situation because Izzy was winning and Izzy had him fucked up. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=527.0s)]
*  And they gave him a standing eight count which they could do with kickboxing. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=535.0s)]
*  And they allowed him to recover and then he went back and he knocked out Izzy. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=538.0s)]
*  And then this one down 3-1 going into the fifth and he puts it on him. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=542.0s)]
*  Yeah that was some Ousmane shit. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=547.0s)]
*  Listen man, it was more dramatic honestly. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=550.0s)]
*  I shouldn't say that because the Ousmane thing was last minute Leon lands that perfect head kick. It was one shot. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=555.0s)]
*  This was like, is he going to get him? Is he going to get him? Oh my god, he's hurt, he's hurt, he's hurt. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=562.0s)]
*  And for Pahara, what a Cinderella story. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=567.0s)]
*  That guy came from kickboxing, was the only two division, he was holding two division champion simultaneously. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=571.0s)]
*  So he was the 185 pound champion and the 205 pound champion simultaneously. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=582.0s)]
*  And was knocking people into another dimension in kickboxing. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=587.0s)]
*  You watch his highlight reel, it's fucking sensational. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=591.0s)]
*  He's putting together a pretty sweet highlight reel in the UFC too. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=595.0s)]
*  Oh my god, he's a monster. He really is a monster. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=598.0s)]
*  He's so big for the weight class, which really wears you out, that weight cut. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=601.0s)]
*  That's a big weight cut. And with wrestling, he's going to have issues because he's not a grappler, that's not his forte. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=607.0s)]
*  And he's getting better at grappling, but that was when Izzy takes you down and Izzy controls you on the ground. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=614.0s)]
*  And Izzy's not, that's not his forte either. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=619.0s)]
*  I wondered, is someone going to shoot, is someone going to try to take it to the ground? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=623.0s)]
*  But to see Izzy do it, well to see Pahara do it first, he did it at the end of the second. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=629.0s)]
*  And then to see Izzy do it, to him and control him and beat him up, I was like wow. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=634.0s)]
*  I mean he had his back, he was pummeling him. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=641.0s)]
*  Yep, the hooks. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=643.0s)]
*  Yeah man, it was a wild fight. And for sure they're going to fight again. I mean I hope so. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=644.0s)]
*  I don't know if they go straight to it, but the thing is like Pahara, his wrestling is going to be an issue. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=650.0s)]
*  Like he's got to really figure out a way to, but that was an issue with Izzy too, early in Izzy's career. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=658.0s)]
*  And he had to figure out how to tighten that up and he did. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=664.0s)]
*  I mean Pahara came in, like what, like they said they were saying he was like 220 pounds. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=666.0s)]
*  He could have been, yeah he could have been. I mean he certainly gets above that in between fights. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=673.0s)]
*  And he has a hard time making 185. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=678.0s)]
*  Oh man, I wonder, like this is a question I've been dying to ask. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=680.0s)]
*  What do you think about if, like when the fighters, they're putting on the Vaseline, you know, they're getting checked out by the ref, right? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=685.0s)]
*  What if they were standing on a scale at that point? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=696.0s)]
*  So that it was transparent, you could actually know compared to what they weighed in at and then when they actually step into the octagon for the fight. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=699.0s)]
*  They do that for some boxing matches. They'll let you know, like what the guy's weighing when he steps into the ring. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=710.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's a bullshit thing. It's basically sanctioned cheating. It really is, but everybody does it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=715.0s)]
*  But Izzy barely does it. When Izzy went up to fight Jan Bojovic at light heavyweight he weighed 194. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=721.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=728.0s)]
*  Which is crazy, because Bojovic is a giant light heavyweight. I mean Bojovic is a big powerful guy at light heavyweight and Izzy didn't gain any weight. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=729.0s)]
*  Right, because Izzy figured that if he put on a bunch of weight to go up a weight class that he might lose his speed. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=738.0s)]
*  Well, you also have muscles that need oxygen and you might lose some of your endurance and a big part of his game is not just speed, it's movement. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=745.0s)]
*  And you don't want to have a smaller gas tank when you're fighting a guy who's just a murderous power striker like Bojovic is. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=754.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=761.0s)]
*  Because Bojovic puts people in another dimension. That motherfucker hits so hard. The last thing you want to do is be standing in front of that guy. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=762.0s)]
*  Right. Of course the story of the Bojovic fight was all wrestling. He held him down. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=769.0s)]
*  And so when Pahara came in weighing what looked like 220 pounds. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=777.0s)]
*  He looks like a light heavyweight. He really does. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=782.0s)]
*  Right. And then I was wondering, oh, why are we going to see him hold Izzy down the way Bojovic did? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=784.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not his style. His style is murderous striker. He's a legitimate descendant of Amazon tribesmen. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=791.0s)]
*  Like no bullshit. His family comes from the Amazon. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=801.0s)]
*  I'm not sure what language it is, what's the language called, but that's hands of stone in his language. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=806.0s)]
*  That dude is fucking special. He's so scary. And if he fucking learns how to wrestle and he learns how to take people down too. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=814.0s)]
*  I mean, if he gets really good at that and gets good at stuffing the takedowns and makes people stand with him. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=824.0s)]
*  God damn, man. He's so powerful for that weight class. So powerful. And I mean, even at 205 he's fucking powerful. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=829.0s)]
*  Like when he was fighting kickboxing when he was going up to 205, he was nuking people at 205 with big gloves. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=838.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's a terrifying dude. So like when you got a specialist like Izzy who's just a specialist kickboxer. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=844.0s)]
*  Worst case scenario is the best kickboxer in the world enters into MMA and that's what happened. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=852.0s)]
*  I mean, you can make an argument that he's certainly the best kickboxer in the world at 185 pounds. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=857.0s)]
*  He lost to Vahitov in his last fight in kickboxing, but Vahitov is the cream of the crop. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=865.0s)]
*  And Vahitov is super, super technical and it was a split decision. It was a very, very, very close fight. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=872.0s)]
*  So that was his last kickboxing bout in glory. Other than that, the other elite guys in kickboxing that were supposed to fight in MMA, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=877.0s)]
*  one of them is Cedric Doumbay. And I've had Cedric on the podcast before and he's another dude. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=887.0s)]
*  He's a fucking real problem if he gets into MMA and he's been taking his time and learning wrestling. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=892.0s)]
*  And he went down to AKA and trained with those guys for a while. But he has some sort of an issue, a medical issue, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=898.0s)]
*  and how to pull out of his fight in France. He was supposed to have his UFC debut. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=904.0s)]
*  And now I think he said he was in some sort of a dispute with glory because they're kind of upset that he's leaving glory and going over to the UFC. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=909.0s)]
*  I hope he gets over there because that's another guy that like all those dudes at 170 that like to strike. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=916.0s)]
*  Like, good fucking luck. Good luck with that guy. Yeah, because he's a motherfucker. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=922.0s)]
*  And he's a motherfucker against strikers. Like when you get a world champion striker who enters into MMA, all fights start on the feet, man. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=928.0s)]
*  They all start in an advantageous position. It's like if you're fighting a grappler and all fights started on the ground, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=936.0s)]
*  like every fight started with that dude on top of you, that'd be terrifying. Right? Well, that's what it is. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=942.0s)]
*  Like all fights start standing up. Well, with kickboxing, like, I mean, I'm not really familiar with where you even watch kickboxing. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=948.0s)]
*  Glory. You got to go to the glory has most of their shows are on the web and you could go to I think it's a fight. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=957.0s)]
*  I think it's fite.com is where it's glory kickboxing.com. There's a link to it and you could stream it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=967.0s)]
*  What I usually do is I get it on my phone and then I use the Apple app and I stream it to my television through Apple TV. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=975.0s)]
*  Does that mean that there's not like a ton of money for kickboxing? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=983.0s)]
*  There's not as much money in kickboxing. No. Glory is the biggest organization for kickboxing in the world. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=988.0s)]
*  And they put on phenomenal fights and I'm a giant fan of the organization. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=993.0s)]
*  But it's weird to me that boxing got so popular in the United States and around the world and MMA got so popular in the United States and around the world. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=997.0s)]
*  But kickboxing never really caught on here. It doesn't make any sense because it's so exciting when you watch guys that are like high like Cedric Dumbay or Alex Pajera or Vahit Tauf. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1008.0s)]
*  These fucking world class kickboxers are so exciting. It's not like a bad product. The product is sensational. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1021.0s)]
*  We see people dying in boxing and we don't see people dying in MMA. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1029.0s)]
*  Knock on wood. Right. I have a theory about that. That it's about the gloves. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1037.0s)]
*  Because if you take football, back in the day when they had just the little leather helmet. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1045.0s)]
*  Back then people wouldn't hit their head so much because they had a little fucking leather helmet on. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1053.0s)]
*  But then now in modern football you've got this crazy helmet that lets you bash your head around with seeming impunity. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1060.0s)]
*  And because of that people are hitting their head so much more and as a result they've got all this CTE going on. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1073.0s)]
*  That's a real theory shared by other people as well. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1080.0s)]
*  So yeah with boxing, these humongous gloves, it's like you can throw your fist around with impunity. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1083.0s)]
*  But then that's why. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1092.0s)]
*  There's a lot of thought to that. Also there's only one option. That option is to punch. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1095.0s)]
*  You can't clinch, you can't take people down, you can't kick and stay on the outside. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1102.0s)]
*  You have to stay inside a boxing range because that's the only sport you're playing. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1107.0s)]
*  There's a lot of thought to that about the big gloves too. There's a lot more thudding. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1111.0s)]
*  The thing that people don't understand about head injuries is that CTE in particular, you don't have to get knocked unconscious to get it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1116.0s)]
*  Repeated small blows can give you CTE. In fact there's some soccer players that get CTE. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1126.0s)]
*  Right. When I think about that, way back when before I got sober I had this tour. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1133.0s)]
*  It was called the Don't Try This at Home Tour. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1145.0s)]
*  I would promote every show by saying I will be drunk and on drugs or your money back. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1148.0s)]
*  And I'm in it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1155.0s)]
*  What year was this? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1158.0s)]
*  It started in 2001 and I ran that until like 2005. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1160.0s)]
*  You would just watch me get completely hammered on stage like pounding tequila and shit. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1166.0s)]
*  When I came out on stage I would walk out with a suitcase of Budweiser cans. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1174.0s)]
*  I'd toss them out of the crowd and I would take the can, I'd start out with one and I would just bash my head with it until the can exploded. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1181.0s)]
*  I'd be particularly proud if the can broke into two separate pieces. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1191.0s)]
*  After I broke the one can, then I would take out two cans, one in each hand and go back and forth and break both of them. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1197.0s)]
*  Every show I would break three beers over my head and I would do that every night. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1207.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1214.0s)]
*  And that, what I understand about the CTE phenomenon is that you're absolutely right. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1215.0s)]
*  It's not about how hard you get hit, it's the accumulation of lots of little hits and that's why football is the biggest one. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1221.0s)]
*  Did you suffer anything from that? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1228.0s)]
*  The worst part was that then after I got sober I started doing stand up. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1230.0s)]
*  Like initially there was a period where I would do it with sparkling water cans. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1236.0s)]
*  And you were doing it still? You were still beating yourself in the head? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1242.0s)]
*  I did it for a little while. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1245.0s)]
*  How many times do you think you've beaten yourself in the head? How many shows? If you had to count them all up? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1248.0s)]
*  Hundreds. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1253.0s)]
*  Hundreds. Oh my God. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1255.0s)]
*  Right. And I mean as far as I can tell I'm in pretty good shape. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1257.0s)]
*  Tony Hawk told me one time, he says that he found out with regard to CTE that there's a gene which will make you predisposed to Alzheimer's disease. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1262.0s)]
*  APOE4. Yeah. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1277.0s)]
*  And if you have that gene then you're very much at risk for CTE. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1279.0s)]
*  But if you don't have that gene you're considerably less at risk. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1285.0s)]
*  And he said that when he found that out he went and got the test and determined that he did not have that gene. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1289.0s)]
*  And when I heard that I kind of chewed on it for a while. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1297.0s)]
*  I ended up like, it was kind of nagging at me and I ended up reaching back out to Tony. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1302.0s)]
*  I said hey Tony, about that test, what was your plan if you did have the gene? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1308.0s)]
*  You can't un-hate yourself in the head. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1315.0s)]
*  And he's like oh, well I didn't have a plan. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1318.0s)]
*  Well how can you have a plan after the fact? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1321.0s)]
*  Right, exactly. So I'm like I don't want to fucking go take that test. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1323.0s)]
*  I don't want to know if I have that goddamn gene or not. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1327.0s)]
*  Well if it's been this many years afterwards you're not suffering, you probably don't have that gene. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1329.0s)]
*  I also went to, and now of course, famously the whole CTE phenomenon, you can't find out if you have it until you've died. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1334.0s)]
*  I think they can tell now. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1345.0s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1348.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a new way that they can tell before you die. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1349.0s)]
*  But it used to be that they had to wait and do an autopsy on you. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1353.0s)]
*  Right. Well I went to some brain specialist kind of guy. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1355.0s)]
*  Were you having problems? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1359.0s)]
*  No. I just went because I was interested. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1360.0s)]
*  And Dr. Drew sent me to this guy. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1363.0s)]
*  It was actually when I was trying to get cauliflower ear as part of my multimedia comedy. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1367.0s)]
*  And I remember telling you too that I was like I'm going to do a crazy bit and I'm trying to get cauliflower ear. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1378.0s)]
*  And I remember you telling me that you were like, nope, I don't support that. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1384.0s)]
*  You said, I think that cauliflower ear is something that should be earned. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1389.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking, oh well. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1392.0s)]
*  And I became buddies with Chuck Liddell. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1396.0s)]
*  And Chuck Liddell and I got together. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1401.0s)]
*  We made the fucking funniest, craziest video of him trying to get... [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1404.0s)]
*  I made this helmet that I designed that left my ears sticking out to protect my head from head shots a little bit. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1410.0s)]
*  And my ears sticking out. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1423.0s)]
*  And I got Chuck Liddell fucking sets a golf ball on my ear and fucking whacks it off for the golf club. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1425.0s)]
*  Oh no. Did you get cauliflower ear? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1432.0s)]
*  No. Then we spent two days with Chuck trying to do it. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1436.0s)]
*  And it just didn't work. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1443.0s)]
*  Then I got together with Rhonda Rousey and was on the mats with her and she's like her hand and Travis just like roughing up my ear all day long. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1445.0s)]
*  And they're looking at my ear. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1454.0s)]
*  They're like, dude, we got it. That's it. You know, we got it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1457.0s)]
*  And then it just went away. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1460.0s)]
*  Then I got together with Jorge Masvidal. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1462.0s)]
*  He put his BMF belt over my ear and he's just like punching it against a door. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1464.0s)]
*  And he's like, dude, that's it right there, man. That's cauliflower. We got it. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1473.0s)]
*  Still no? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1478.0s)]
*  Then I got together with John Jones. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1480.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1482.0s)]
*  He had like the who's who. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1484.0s)]
*  You're such a glutton for punishment. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1486.0s)]
*  Who's who of the UFC Hall of Fame? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1488.0s)]
*  Like give their best shot. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1490.0s)]
*  And everybody said, dude, we got it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1492.0s)]
*  And then it didn't work. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1494.0s)]
*  Dude, John Jones blasted my ear into oblivion. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1496.0s)]
*  Like, oh, with a phone. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1499.0s)]
*  He took what at the time was his current light heavyweight belt. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1502.0s)]
*  And like. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1507.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there we go. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1511.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. And he's hammering your ear. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1513.0s)]
*  Dude. Oh my God. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1515.0s)]
*  He so upsettingly overdid it that my ear got got blasted apart. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1517.0s)]
*  And you still didn't get cauliflower. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1524.0s)]
*  Oh, God. So bloody. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1526.0s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. What the fuck? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1529.0s)]
*  We're not putting that on the video. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1533.0s)]
*  Did you get that? You just chipped it off. You didn't get stitched up. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1535.0s)]
*  Just cut that little piece off. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1537.0s)]
*  Just chopped it off. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1539.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1541.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you have like the Evander Holyfield. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1542.0s)]
*  Tyson bit Holyfield's ear. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1545.0s)]
*  Right. That was that was an idea that I pitched for Jackass like multiple times. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1547.0s)]
*  I was like, do I want like Mike Tyson to bite a child? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1553.0s)]
*  Oh, no. Oh my God. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1556.0s)]
*  You know, he's selling gummies now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1559.0s)]
*  So the weed gummies of ears. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1562.0s)]
*  Dude, Mike is so classic, dude. He's the best. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1564.0s)]
*  I fucking love him. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1567.0s)]
*  I saw him at the fights. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1569.0s)]
*  It's like when that guy gets a pop one, they show him on the screen. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1570.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. Everybody goes nuts. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1573.0s)]
*  How about fucking Patty the baddie? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1575.0s)]
*  Yeah. Can you even believe? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1577.0s)]
*  Well, he's a character. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1579.0s)]
*  You know, people get really attracted to characters, you know, like Molly McCann. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1580.0s)]
*  Same thing. Like when. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1585.0s)]
*  More so when Patty the baddie kind of just showed up and exploded like Molly exploded with him. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1587.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they trained together. Yeah. Right. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1594.0s)]
*  But, you know, also she had some pretty spectacular performances and she's a wild character. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1596.0s)]
*  She gets fucking fired up and jumps around. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1601.0s)]
*  And I talked to Dave Portnoy, he bet 10 grand on Molly McCann. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1603.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, this last week. Yeah. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1607.0s)]
*  And he was like, what do you think about that bet? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1609.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1611.0s)]
*  I'm like, listen, Molly's tough. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1613.0s)]
*  Anything can happen. But Aaron Blanchfield is a fucking assassin. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1615.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was that was a tough one to watch. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1619.0s)]
*  That girl's a straight up killer. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1621.0s)]
*  You don't see it that. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1623.0s)]
*  You never see it when when when both of a fighter's arms are absolutely fucking just out of the equation. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1626.0s)]
*  You know, like John Jones done that to people. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1638.0s)]
*  That was Roy Nelson used to do that to people all the time. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1640.0s)]
*  It was a big country. That was his move. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1643.0s)]
*  He'd get people in the crucifix crucifix is a terrible position to be in. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1645.0s)]
*  Have you ever been stuck there before by Holly Holm? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1649.0s)]
*  Oh, really? That's hilarious. You can't get out of it. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1652.0s)]
*  It's so hard to get out of it. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1654.0s)]
*  Like you have to be elite to get out of that. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1656.0s)]
*  There's a few techniques that you could do to get out of that. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1658.0s)]
*  The key is you have to get an arm free. You must. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1661.0s)]
*  Like, first of all, you have to really do your best to never let that arm get trapped like that. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1664.0s)]
*  But if you're fighting a superior grappler and you get caught like that and you saw in a way, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1668.0s)]
*  that's how Jean-Huey Lee tapped out Carla Esparza. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1675.0s)]
*  She started off with the crucifix. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1679.0s)]
*  She started out with the crucifix on her back and then twisted to the rear naked choke and got the choke from that position. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1681.0s)]
*  It's a terrible position because legs are so much stronger. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1687.0s)]
*  You know, like when your legs are trapping that arm, that arm's fucked, right? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1691.0s)]
*  And then the head pins down traps the other one. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1694.0s)]
*  And then you're just it's just head and fist and elbows in your face. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1697.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you just get fucking noogie to death. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1701.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was at a Jackson Wink with Holly Holm and she took my arms away from me and just showed me what she could do. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1705.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. She didn't do it, but she was just like, and then with the elbow. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1715.0s)]
*  Did that make you want to train? Did it make you want to learn how to not be in that situation? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1719.0s)]
*  No, not at all. Nothing. If a girl did that to me, I'd be like so upset. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1723.0s)]
*  I'd be like, I need to learn how to fight. Fuck this. That's so humiliating. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1728.0s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't see it that way. I felt like it was kind of an honor. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1733.0s)]
*  You know, I get it. Yeah. I mean, she's a world champion. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1737.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's she's so she's a beast. Such a wonderful person. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1739.0s)]
*  Oh, she's so sweet. Yeah. You would never imagine she's a fucking stone cold killer. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1744.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. That head kick knockout of Ronda Rousey was like one of the greatest knockouts of all time. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1748.0s)]
*  Like without a doubt, without a doubt. And to see it in Australia live, it was so fucking crazy. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1755.0s)]
*  She gets you. And she's nice that she's pounded on the ground and not on your face. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1762.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a horrible place to be. Now, imagine John Jones getting you in there. Right. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1769.0s)]
*  You know, it's a bad spot. Real bad spot. And Erin is she's so good on the ground. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1776.0s)]
*  And the way she explained it when I did the post fight interview, how she explained how she went for the Kimura [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1782.0s)]
*  and then Molly got her arm free and then she trapped it again and then got the leg over the head. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1788.0s)]
*  And then once you got the leg over the head, I was begging her to tap. I was like, please. Yeah, I heard that. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1793.0s)]
*  Please tap. Because if you don't tap, you get a spiral fracture. It's a horrible fracture. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1798.0s)]
*  If you watch Frank Mir versus Minotaur Noguera. Now, Minotaur Noguera is a legend. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1804.0s)]
*  I mean, he's one of the greatest heavyweight fighters of all time. He's the heavyweight champion of pride. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1810.0s)]
*  He was a fucking monster. And Frank Mir snapped his arm and it's I don't even want to watch it again, man. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1815.0s)]
*  It's horrible to watch. But he goes for a guillotine and Frank gets on top of them. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1821.0s)]
*  So here he is like Frank's on the bottom here. Frank reverses him. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1827.0s)]
*  Frank gets on top and Frank gets him in a Kimura. And when he gets him in a Kimura, he he breaks his arm. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1831.0s)]
*  And the snap, I remember hearing the snap. It was so horrific. See, he's got it now. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1838.0s)]
*  He's got it now. And now he's going to step over and now he's in side control. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1844.0s)]
*  Now he steps over with the leg. Now watch when he steps over with that right leg. Watch this. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1849.0s)]
*  Now watch this right here. Snap. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1860.0s)]
*  Oh, Frank is so big and so strong that your arm has no chance. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1864.0s)]
*  You're your arm. And Frank has broken two different world champions arms inside the octagon. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1871.0s)]
*  He broke Tim Sylvia's arm with an arm bar and then he broke Minotaro's arm. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1876.0s)]
*  And when you when that arm breaks like that, man, I just I don't think you're ever the same again. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1882.0s)]
*  Snap. See that? That's it right there. So what happens is all the pressure is on this bone. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1887.0s)]
*  And so it's like this going that way and this bone from just the angle. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1893.0s)]
*  It just snaps and you get all the like he's got a giant plate and they have to piece your arm back together like a jigsaw puzzle and screw it all in place. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1898.0s)]
*  And even then, like you're always going to have this bar in your arm and it's probably there's probably nerve damage and tissue damage. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1907.0s)]
*  And it's probably never going to be the same. Right. Fuck that. Tap. Just tap. Please. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1914.0s)]
*  The other time was Khabib when he had Michael Johnson. I was like, please tap, please tap, please tap. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1920.0s)]
*  Right. And then Islam Akhachev, he had Dan Hooker. And again, I'm going, please tap, please tap. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1926.0s)]
*  You got to tap like live to fight another day. There's times when you got to tap. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1932.0s)]
*  And the Kimura is a big one when the guy gets the leg over your face and he's just got that angle and he's cranking it like, oh, Jesus. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1936.0s)]
*  Just tap. Just tap. I got another MMA question. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1943.0s)]
*  Live odds at the beginning of of round two, round three, like they show the odds before the fight. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1950.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like, like DC told me he thought that that could be a good alternative to open scoring if they just showed the live odds at the. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1960.0s)]
*  I think as a fan, I would love to know like how the odds are. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1971.0s)]
*  It's uniform. Always have what the live odds are going into each new round. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1976.0s)]
*  It's not bad. I mean, it definitely encourages gambling, which I support. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1982.0s)]
*  I just I think gambling is fun. You know, I support gambling like I support drinking. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1988.0s)]
*  I get that some people can't drink. I get that some people can't gamble. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1993.0s)]
*  I do get I've look I've known a lot of people that were addicted to gambling and it's a crazy addiction because did you ever see that Adam Sandlin movie? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=1996.0s)]
*  Yes. The uncut gems. Amazing. Unbelievably disturbing. So good. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2006.0s)]
*  And such a perfect representation of a gambling addict. They can't fucking they need that fucking juice. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2011.0s)]
*  They need it. They need that next bet. They need. Come on. Come on. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2019.0s)]
*  Come on. Yes. When they win, they go fucking crazy. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2023.0s)]
*  I mean, it's it's a real problem for some people. Gambling is they ruin everything in their life. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2027.0s)]
*  It's a real problem for some people. But I support it because I feel like you need to have control over your life. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2033.0s)]
*  And if you don't have control of your life, get control of your life. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2039.0s)]
*  And if gambling is stopping you from having control of your life, don't make gambling illegal. Just you don't gamble. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2041.0s)]
*  I agree. Get your life in order. Yeah. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2047.0s)]
*  Yeah. As an alcoholic drug addict, you know, I'm not mad at drugs and alcohol. I just can't have it. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2049.0s)]
*  Yeah. Do you think that you could if you had a different life, could have enjoyed drinking and maybe a little drugs in moderation? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2057.0s)]
*  No. No. You just had that personality. I have it in my fucking pedigree, dude. I am thoroughbred. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2064.0s)]
*  On my mom's side of the family, it's every leaf on the tree. Wow. It didn't skip a generation at all. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2073.0s)]
*  Like, like for my mom, it was like it was like playing Russian roulette with a fucking completely loaded gun. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2079.0s)]
*  Do you think that's nature or nurture? What do you think causes that? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2089.0s)]
*  I think that I think there's a genetic thing, but it's a little bit like it's a little bit like why did how did the fire start? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2094.0s)]
*  It's like who fucking cares? Just deal with address the fire. Right. Right. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2107.0s)]
*  But I mean, is there cases where the whole family is addicted and there's one person that can have a drink with dinner and they're fine? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2112.0s)]
*  There are. There are for sure. For sure. There's no certainty of it. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2119.0s)]
*  And more often than not, it will skip generations and it will not be everybody. Just in my case, it was fucking everybody. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2124.0s)]
*  And gambling was a thing, too. Like you gambled a lot. No, but but it's in my family. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2130.0s)]
*  Oh, it's probably the same thing, right? It's like this obsession. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2136.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, it's so crazy how like like my dad's side of the family is just straight academics, theologians, zoologists, like just everybody's like Ph.D. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2139.0s)]
*  Or like, you know, create like clergymen, like all, you know, my dad's dad like fought in World War Two and was like decorated like, you know, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2155.0s)]
*  and then there's my mom's side of the family. It's just addiction, gambling, suicide, like the whole deal. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2168.0s)]
*  My mom's father like dodged the draft. He was in Canada, like dodged the draft for World War Two and and like got like fairly obnoxiously wealthy selling bootleg gasoline. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2175.0s)]
*  They had like like ration, you know, for the wartime. And so like like his bootleg gasoline operation, you could buy as much gas as you wanted beyond the ration from my mom, my paternal, my maternal grandfather. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2188.0s)]
*  And he became like obnoxiously wealthy, was like had like a boat, you know, like fucking walked over the crazy wad of cash. And he the fucking dude gambled it all away. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2208.0s)]
*  And then when he was broke, fucking blew his brains out. Oh, Jesus. I don't know that I ever I don't know that I ever met that guy. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2220.0s)]
*  I was that you know, I was a baby when when that happened. But like, it doesn't make any sense because with all the alcoholism that didn't deter me from becoming an alcoholic, but I did manage to stay away from gambling. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2228.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2244.0s)]
*  100% [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2245.0s)]
*  100% [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2246.0s)]
*  I've placed the only time I bet in my adult life. I've still never placed a bit in a casino or anything like that. But but when I did a like a brand deal on social media, I got paid to promote some online gambling thing. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2247.0s)]
*  That was when I showed up at the fight and I was like holding up the all the cash. And I took the photo with you. Yeah. And that was when I bet on Poirier and and and McGregor's leg snapped that night. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2267.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2282.0s)]
*  So that was my first ever bet. I ended up like betting like a couple times after that as part of the same deal as part of like the and I lost her. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2283.0s)]
*  And then you have done. Yeah, I'm done. Yeah, it's a it definitely makes fights more exciting if you've got if you personally have money riding on it. Sure. But if you do have an obsessive thing like I could see how it would transfer for some people it transfers to positive stuff. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2294.0s)]
*  Like I know a lot of people that were drug addicts that became really fitness fanatics. Sure. You know, they start like my friend John Joseph. He started doing Iron Man. John Joseph is great. Yeah. A lot of people do that. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2309.0s)]
*  They become marathon runners or they work out fiends. Yeah, that's their new drug of choice. Yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2320.0s)]
*  The fucking for me, I think that I'm just obsessed about about just doing shit, just accomplishing shit. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2328.0s)]
*  Well, that's a good thing to transfer to. It's like I think it's kind of the same gene, the gene that can or whatever it is. I shouldn't say gene. It's the same thing in the mind that gets you obsessed with your next high or your next like wild thing. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2341.0s)]
*  You could also transfer that to accomplishing personal goals and fitness goals and just getting your life together, starting a business, being obsessed with the business. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2359.0s)]
*  Like you can do it in a positive way with that same mindset. And oftentimes you see that with fighters like some of the best fighters. They had like real horrible bouts of alcoholism or drug abuse in their past. Mark Kerr. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2369.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he had it while he was at the top. Right. It wasn't something that he got over. You know, he actually kind of took him down and was crazy about him is that while it was all happening, they were filming a documentary, the smashing machine, which is really crazy because they didn't film that documentary with the intent of of like capturing this guy's life falling apart due to drug addiction. He was on top of the world. He was murdering everybody. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2383.0s)]
*  But a lot of guys get into painkillers, a lot of guys, including bodybuilders and power lifters. It's like they're in pain because of the it's so you know, you're lifting crazy amounts of weight and you're fucking up your back and fucking up your elbows and your shoulders. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2410.0s)]
*  Instead of dealing with it, you just take a pain pill. Yeah, I just keep powering through. They say Ronnie Coleman used to do that. You know, Ronnie Coleman, who was Mr. Olympia, who now has his whole back fused his whole back, like every spinal, all the different vertebrae are fused together. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2426.0s)]
*  And he's fucked. Like whoever did that, like Jesus Christ, like there's different ways to fix people's backs. You don't have to do that. How does he he's in real real pain. He can barely move around. He went down and got some stem cells and he's got some improvement. Now I think he went to bioaccelerated. Yeah, I think he went down there and they helped him a bit. But you know, there's he's got a lot of nerve damage and his legs don't work correctly anymore. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2448.0s)]
*  With all of your vertebrae fused together, you would imagine like still working out though. He can. I mean, he's addicted to working out. But I mean, he's his whole back is like completely fused. But at one point in time, I mean, he is he's in a wheelchair. Like when he came to do the podcast, he was in a wheelchair. Crazy. He can kind of stand up, but he really can't move around that good. But he's got a fucking amazing attitude, even though that's the case. Like guys that feel sorry for themselves that I do it all over again. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2476.0s)]
*  I mean, he was one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time, but he was different than everybody else in that when Ronnie was at the top of his game, Ronnie was lifting enormous amounts of weight like a lot of bodybuilders. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2506.0s)]
*  They just do very, very high reps and a lot of steroids. Ronnie was lifting crazy weight like wild, wild amounts because he just wanted to be massive, just as massive as a person could be. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2518.0s)]
*  And he accomplished that, but he paid the price because he you know, he would hurt his back and just keep lifting, like go through the set. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2532.0s)]
*  He wouldn't stop and pause and assess what was wrong with him. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2539.0s)]
*  And look at him when he was in his prime, like, good Lord, man. Good Lord. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2542.0s)]
*  Look at the mass on that man. I mean, look at the fucking legs. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2547.0s)]
*  I mean, without doubt, one of the greatest to ever do it. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2552.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just watched that Killer Sally show on Netflix. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2557.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2562.0s)]
*  It's a... [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2563.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a woman bodybuilder, right? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2564.0s)]
*  Woman bodybuilder, but she was married to this guy Ray McNeil, who she ultimately shot. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2566.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2573.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of these like true crime type situations. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2574.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2579.0s)]
*  It's pretty fascinating. It's just like a three part. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2580.0s)]
*  But yeah, they get pretty heavily into the whole bodybuilding culture and yeah. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2582.0s)]
*  Is a thing that happens to a woman when she starts taking steroids, where she gets that manly look in her face, it creeps me the fuck out. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2589.0s)]
*  You know, there's like go to the original picture that you posted up, Jamie. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2596.0s)]
*  The original one. No, they were right there. Yeah. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2600.0s)]
*  Look at her face on the left. See how she got like this is this like a manliness to her. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2603.0s)]
*  It's like it's very hard to describe. Like what makes it manly? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2608.0s)]
*  I don't know, but it's not just that she has giant traps and big fucking shoulders and chest muscles. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2612.0s)]
*  But it's also like her face has a manly quality like the one on the right. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2618.0s)]
*  That picture on the right where that dude has his arm around her. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2623.0s)]
*  Is that the guy she killed? Yep. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2626.0s)]
*  Sorry, buddy. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2628.0s)]
*  But look at her face there. She's got like a manly face. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2629.0s)]
*  That's very manly. It's super manly. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2633.0s)]
*  Right. There's something that happens. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2635.0s)]
*  Dude, she fucking went into the bedroom, fucking came out with a shotgun, fucking smoked the dude, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2637.0s)]
*  and then went back into the bedroom, got another shell and reloaded it, came out and shot him in the face. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2646.0s)]
*  Oh, jeez. What did he do to her? Was it an abusive relationship? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2651.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was a lot of accusations of domestic violence. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2655.0s)]
*  Domestic violence. Yeah, but still. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2661.0s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people are questioning whether that was a good call. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2663.0s)]
*  Well, I think they're probably both out of their fucking minds. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2676.0s)]
*  If you're doing that much juice and you get jacked up, you're probably... [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2679.0s)]
*  I think when a human being is taking hyperhuman levels of hormones, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2682.0s)]
*  you're not even really a human anymore. You're this wild thing that's part human, part chemicals. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2691.0s)]
*  What's the difference between steroids like that and TRT? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2698.0s)]
*  Well, it depends on how much TRT you take, right? Right. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2703.0s)]
*  So if you're taking normal doses of TRT, then you're just like a normal man. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2705.0s)]
*  The idea is that as you age and you take TRT, your body repairs itself and functions well, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2710.0s)]
*  and your immune system functions well, like it did when you were younger. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2719.0s)]
*  And it works if you don't abuse it. But if you're a crazy person and you say, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2722.0s)]
*  well, instead of this amount, I'm going to take double. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2727.0s)]
*  Instead of taking it twice a week, I'm going to take it three times a week, double three times a week. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2730.0s)]
*  That's a lot. And people definitely do that. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2735.0s)]
*  And if you get addicts, and you give... [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2738.0s)]
*  Like if an addict, you don't have to go to a clinic to get the shot, you give the shot yourself, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2741.0s)]
*  you just say, I'm going to keep shooting up. And then you go to multiple doctors, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2746.0s)]
*  like if they don't have a database on whether or not you're on testosterone from this doctor, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2750.0s)]
*  and also from that doctor. I knew a dude had a pill problem. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2754.0s)]
*  And what he used to do is he would go to multiple doctors and get opiates. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2758.0s)]
*  And he was fucked up all the time. And he was mad that these doctors gave it to him. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2764.0s)]
*  I'm like, bitch, you didn't tell them that you were going to... Take it on yourself, man. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2768.0s)]
*  Like you fucking did it to yourself. I know it sucks. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2772.0s)]
*  And I know like you probably didn't know it was that hard to kick or that addictive, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2775.0s)]
*  but he fucking purposely went to multiple different doctors. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2780.0s)]
*  He used to live in Texas, then he moved to California. He was getting it from both doctors. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2783.0s)]
*  So he's taking a lot. And listen, for a long time, they'll just keep prescribing it to you. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2787.0s)]
*  I think they're probably a little more sensitive to that now. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2794.0s)]
*  Walmart just got hit today. They got a $3 billion settlement today they had to give out [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2797.0s)]
*  because of their contribution to the opioid crisis. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2806.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2809.0s)]
*  Make sure that's right. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2810.0s)]
*  Was that part of like the... [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2811.0s)]
*  Yeah, Walmart agrees to give $3.1 billion to Opioid Settlement Framework. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2812.0s)]
*  Well, that's a tiny fucking piece of how much they earned, which is really disturbing. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2818.0s)]
*  You find out the Sackler family, how much they actually made from lying about the addictive properties of it. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2822.0s)]
*  I mean, pushing it on people. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2831.0s)]
*  Dude, when I got my nose fixed, I had a deviated septum. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2833.0s)]
*  I got out of there. And once I woke up and everything, the doctors are, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2837.0s)]
*  okay, I've got you two different painkillers. I go, do I need those? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2842.0s)]
*  He's like, you're going to need those. I go, but is it going to get worse than it is right now? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2846.0s)]
*  He's like, no, might not. I go, but right now it doesn't hurt at all. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2849.0s)]
*  I got to know why you give me these. He's like, just take it. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2854.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well, shouldn't I like, wouldn't it be better if I didn't take it and then I came to you and I needed it? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2858.0s)]
*  I was like, what am I doing with this? I never filled them at all. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2864.0s)]
*  I've not filled out a prescription for painkillers once since I got sober. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2866.0s)]
*  Well, since you got sober, it's a good call. I've never had a problem with painkillers. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2870.0s)]
*  In fact, I had my knee repaired in 94 and they gave, I can't remember if they gave me Percocet or Vicodin. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2874.0s)]
*  I don't remember which one, but I wound up selling them at the pool hall because I was like, this is terrible. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2881.0s)]
*  I'd rather be in pain. But for my personality, whatever it is, like me being stupid was the hardest part [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2885.0s)]
*  because I was just laying on my couch. It took them one day and I was so stupid. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2892.0s)]
*  I was like, I can't live like this. Like I feel so dumb. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2897.0s)]
*  Like whatever it is with me, my own biology, how I react to painkillers, no bueno. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2901.0s)]
*  So my next knee operation when I got my ACL reconstructed, no painkillers at all. I didn't take shit. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2906.0s)]
*  And so when my nose got fixed, the doctor was like, you're going to have to take painkillers. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2912.0s)]
*  I'm like, for this? Like this doesn't even hurt. It's like once they did the operation, it was mildly uncomfortable. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2915.0s)]
*  That was because they had these big foam tubes stuffed up my nose. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2923.0s)]
*  When you say deviated septum, that means like a hole in the wall? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2927.0s)]
*  No, no. My nose had broken so many times that I only had like one quarter of one nostril that I could get oxygen from. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2931.0s)]
*  The other one was completely closed. So I could go like this and I literally couldn't breathe a thing out of my nose. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2941.0s)]
*  And then on top of that, the same thing that happens to cauliflower ear also happens to the inside of your nose. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2949.0s)]
*  So when you get a bloody nose, your nose gets smashed all the time. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2955.0s)]
*  Calcium deposits can form inside of your nose the same way they form in your ear. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2958.0s)]
*  So my nose is just useless. So the doctor scooped all that shit out and shaved my turbinates down and then reconstructed the actual septum. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2963.0s)]
*  So the path between the two nostrils. So when he did that, when I was 40, it was like the first time I could breathe out of my nose. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2977.0s)]
*  Since I was like five. I fell down a flight of stairs when I was five years old and broke my nose. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2984.0s)]
*  And it's been fucked ever since then. And then from that time, all those years of combat sports, all those years, I broke it in jiu jitsu, I broke it in kickboxing, I broke it in taekwondo. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=2989.0s)]
*  I broke it so many times. It was just useless. But when I got it fixed, the doctor was like, you know, I don't need these pain pills. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3000.0s)]
*  I was like, are you fucking sure? Like, can't I just be uncomfortable? Like, whatever happened to being uncomfortable? Is that okay? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3006.0s)]
*  Right. And you know what? Like, it's incredible how effective Advil and Tylenol are. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3013.0s)]
*  Both those things are terrible for you. Oh, yeah. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3020.0s)]
*  Terrible for you. Do you know that if you take Tylenol, Tylenol is a acetaminophen. If you take 20 times more than the dose, you're dead. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3022.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3031.0s)]
*  Dead. There's a lot of people who die every year from Tylenol poisoning. In fact, there was a really terrible story about a woman who had COVID. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3032.0s)]
*  And she was in agony because she had COVID. So she just kept taking Tylenol. She died from liver failure. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3040.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3045.0s)]
*  From fucking Tylenol. It's terrible for you. Advil's terrible for you. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3046.0s)]
*  Advil's bad for your stomach. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3050.0s)]
*  Yes. It's bad for a lot of things. But they're non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. And they cause gut inflammation in a lot of people. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3052.0s)]
*  Like my friend Cam, he was taking 800 milligrams of Advil every day because he runs every day and he was always in pain. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3061.0s)]
*  He heard a podcast I did with Dr. Rhonda Patrick. She explained all the dangers of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and what they do to your gut and what they do to your gut biome and how they actually create inflammation. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3068.0s)]
*  So he gets off of them. All his fucking pain went away. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3079.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3082.0s)]
*  So taking anti-inflammatories for pain was actually the source of his pain. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3083.0s)]
*  Huh. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3089.0s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3090.0s)]
*  Well, if you're doing it on an ongoing basis, then I think that that is a dynamic that will, you know... [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3092.0s)]
*  Yeah. In his case, it was pretty extreme. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3100.0s)]
*  Right. Like if it's pretty rare that you're in pain and you take... [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3102.0s)]
*  Sure. I mean, if you have a headache and you take it, you know, if you're smart about it and you take it every now and again, I'm sure it's okay. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3110.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3116.0s)]
*  You know, it's like everything else. Your body will recover. But you just have to be careful with that stuff. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3117.0s)]
*  To think that it's completely innocuous just because you could buy it at a drug store is not the case. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3122.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3126.0s)]
*  And the Tylenol poisoning, when Dr. Peter Attia was explaining to me that just 20 times the recommended dose will kill you, I was like, that's crazy. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3127.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3137.0s)]
*  I hadn't heard any of that. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3138.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3139.0s)]
*  The food that Advil was bad for your stomach, and I got to be careful with that because I have Barrett's esophagus. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3140.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3146.0s)]
*  It's like erosion of the esophagus, like the tube coming out of your stomach. It's basically from acid reflux and shit. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3147.0s)]
*  And it's scary because it's often a precursor to esophageal cancer. So it's something that I monitor really closely. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3160.0s)]
*  At the moment, I'm stable with it. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3170.0s)]
*  What caused that? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3173.0s)]
*  I don't even know. I think acid reflux. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3175.0s)]
*  But what caused the acid reflux? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3178.0s)]
*  I don't have any idea. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3180.0s)]
*  Is it drugs or alcohol? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3182.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3184.0s)]
*  How many people die a year from Tylenol? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3185.0s)]
*  See, pull up how many people die a year in the United States from acetaminophen. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3188.0s)]
*  When I found that out, I was shocked. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3193.0s)]
*  Well, I first, when I read about that woman who died when she was just trying to get over the COVID, it's responsible for 56,000 emergency department visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and 500 deaths per year in the United States. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3195.0s)]
*  50% of those are unintentional overdoses. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3212.0s)]
*  Wow, 50% of them are intentional then. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3215.0s)]
*  That's awful. What an awful way to go. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3218.0s)]
*  More than 60 million Americans consume acetaminophen on a weekly basis, and many are unaware that it is contained in combined products. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3220.0s)]
*  What about like Bayer? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3232.0s)]
*  No, that's okay. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3234.0s)]
*  Like people take that for their heart? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3235.0s)]
*  Yeah, aspirin, I think in low doses is probably not bad, but I think even aspirin probably can kill you if you take enough of it. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3237.0s)]
*  How many people die every year from aspirin overdose? Let's Google that. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3245.0s)]
*  Let's say yes. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3250.0s)]
*  If it's 500 for Tylenol, let's say it's 50. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3251.0s)]
*  What do you think? How many people a year die from aspirin? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3253.0s)]
*  Maybe it's zero. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3256.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to go with zero. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3257.0s)]
*  Zero? I'm going to go with 50. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3259.0s)]
*  How many people die every year in the United States from aspirin? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3261.0s)]
*  Maybe it can't even kill you. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3264.0s)]
*  But then again, I feel like that was something they said, oh, one aspirin every day is good for if you have a heart condition. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3266.0s)]
*  But then I think they recanted that. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3275.0s)]
*  So I'm actually going to go with not zero. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3277.0s)]
*  Did they really recant that? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3279.0s)]
*  I think they recanted that. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3281.0s)]
*  That was the thing they were always telling you, take an aspirin a day. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3282.0s)]
*  It's not giving me direct information even though I typed it in. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3284.0s)]
*  It's the aspirin industry. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3291.0s)]
*  It causes more than 3,000 deaths per year in the UK, according to what I found. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3293.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a lot more. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3298.0s)]
*  But it says... [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3300.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3301.0s)]
*  Especially the UK does not have that big of a population. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3302.0s)]
*  20,000 bleeds annually, causing at least 3,000 deaths. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3304.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3307.0s)]
*  Okay, there you go. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3309.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. Daily aspirin behind more than 3,000 adult deaths per year. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3311.0s)]
*  So aspirin kills more people than fucking acetaminophen? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3316.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3319.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3321.0s)]
*  Well, we looked at too with acetaminophen was just the US. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3322.0s)]
*  This is showing the UK, which is... [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3325.0s)]
*  Which is a tenth of the population. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3327.0s)]
*  Smaller number, I know. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3329.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3330.0s)]
*  I would have never guessed that. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3331.0s)]
*  I was going with 50. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3333.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3335.0s)]
*  They...seems that they did recant it. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3336.0s)]
*  Oh, look at this though. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3340.0s)]
*  In 2021, it says 227 deaths were recorded in England and Wales as a result of paracetamol poisoning. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3341.0s)]
*  I guess that's aspirin. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3351.0s)]
*  No, this is Tylenol. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3353.0s)]
*  That's Tylenol. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3354.0s)]
*  Oh, you wrote Tylenol deaths. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3355.0s)]
*  Yeah, I switched over back to Tylenol to see what... [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3356.0s)]
*  Oh, why'd you do that? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3357.0s)]
*  We're done with that. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3358.0s)]
*  Well, I wanted to... [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3359.0s)]
*  Because I wasn't getting an answer for US for aspirin, so I wanted to see what it said for UK, since I did have a... [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3360.0s)]
*  So Tylenol per year is half of what it is in America, roughly. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3364.0s)]
*  But aspirin, 3000 deaths per year? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3368.0s)]
*  And the population is 10%. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3372.0s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3375.0s)]
*  I would have never imagined it's that many. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3377.0s)]
*  Maybe it's just because it's more popular. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3380.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3384.0s)]
*  So, does aspirin, daily aspirin, behind more than 3000 deaths per year? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3387.0s)]
*  Whew. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3394.0s)]
*  But I don't know who... [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3395.0s)]
*  And that's... [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3396.0s)]
*  We could probably break that number down, though, too. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3397.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's an accumulation, because it's not sudden deaths. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3399.0s)]
*  It's not like they're just getting a heart attack all of a sudden. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3402.0s)]
*  Scroll back down a little bit. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3404.0s)]
*  It says, expert warn, more people die from aspirin than COVID-19? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3406.0s)]
*  What? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3412.0s)]
*  I wouldn't use this. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3413.0s)]
*  That's why I skipped past this. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3415.0s)]
*  Oh, it's one of them weird... [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3417.0s)]
*  It seems like a fucking link. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3418.0s)]
*  Yeah, what are you going to do? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3419.0s)]
*  These are those fucking clickbaity cunts. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3420.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3422.0s)]
*  I'm going to put you in with some fake headlines, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3423.0s)]
*  some bullshit website that's in Macedonia or some shit. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3425.0s)]
*  It's just designed to get American clicks and sell ads. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3429.0s)]
*  They're so sneaky with that shit. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3432.0s)]
*  I was starting to wonder if you were onto something with the aspirin people. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3434.0s)]
*  Well, that's probably a lot of money in aspirin. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3440.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3444.0s)]
*  And if people were taking it every day... [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3445.0s)]
*  Okay, Google that. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3449.0s)]
*  Does taking aspirin every day prevent heart attacks? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3450.0s)]
*  Because that was the thing that they were saying. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3453.0s)]
*  But I think at that time, they were just saying one aspirin every day. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3455.0s)]
*  The UK thing, I found another way of... [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3460.0s)]
*  This one else is scrapping. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3463.0s)]
*  It says around 40% of adults age 75 or over in the UK take a daily aspirin [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3464.0s)]
*  and have lifelong treatment. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3469.0s)]
*  It is recommended for patients who have previously had a heart attack or stroke. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3471.0s)]
*  This is where the 3,000 number though came from too. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3478.0s)]
*  Hmm, major bleeds. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3481.0s)]
*  So is... [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3483.0s)]
*  Oh, other anti-platelet drugs. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3485.0s)]
*  Oh, hold on a second. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3488.0s)]
*  That says 3,000 deaths caused by aspirin or other anti-platelet drugs. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3489.0s)]
*  So what if those anti-platelet drugs are more potent than aspirin? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3494.0s)]
*  Is that... [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3498.0s)]
*  But that's The Guardian. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3500.0s)]
*  That's a reliable paper, right? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3501.0s)]
*  Harper and drugs. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3503.0s)]
*  Published in Lancet. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3504.0s)]
*  For patients under 65 taking daily aspirin to prevent a recurring stroke or heart attack, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3506.0s)]
*  the annual rate of bleeds requiring hospital admission was approximately 1.5% [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3512.0s)]
*  compared with 3.5% for patients aged 75 to 84 and 5% for those aged 85 or older. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3518.0s)]
*  So you know what it is? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3526.0s)]
*  I guess it's a trade-off, right? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3527.0s)]
*  It probably prevents the clots but also makes you bleed to death. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3529.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3533.0s)]
*  That's the scariest shit when people have... [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3535.0s)]
*  What is that disease where people, their blood doesn't clot? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3537.0s)]
*  Anemia? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3542.0s)]
*  No, not anemia. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3543.0s)]
*  Anemia is when you have a lack of blood. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3544.0s)]
*  What is that disease? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3547.0s)]
*  God damn it, it's at the tip of my tongue. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3549.0s)]
*  I'm going to know it when you say it. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3551.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3553.0s)]
*  This stupid brain of mine. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3555.0s)]
*  It's so good sometimes. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3556.0s)]
*  My brain works so... [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3558.0s)]
*  My memory is so fantastic sometimes. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3559.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3561.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3572.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is scary. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3573.0s)]
*  Your body doesn't stop bleeding? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3574.0s)]

*  You know, I had a friend who had to take some sort of blood thinners because they had something [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3579.0s)]
*  wrong with them and they had to be real careful. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3583.0s)]
*  They couldn't get bruised, nothing. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3586.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3588.0s)]
*  Dude, how about the people who don't feel pain? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3589.0s)]
*  Oh, that's nuts. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3590.0s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3591.0s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3595.0s)]
*  What kind of fucking evolutionary advantage would it be to not feel pain? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3596.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's... [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3601.0s)]
*  No idea, you're injured. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3602.0s)]
*  Is that real? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3603.0s)]
*  Like all pain or is it just like most pain? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3604.0s)]
*  Like broken bones? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3607.0s)]
*  You don't know your broken... [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3608.0s)]
*  I think there are people who don't feel pain, period. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3609.0s)]

*  People with it cannot feel pain. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3624.0s)]
*  Pain sensing nerves in these patients are not properly connected in parts of the brain [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3626.0s)]
*  that receive the pain messages. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3630.0s)]

*  Yeah, pain's important, man. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3640.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3641.0s)]
*  That's why fights are crazy because you don't really feel much while you're fighting. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3642.0s)]

*  You need to feel loss. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3659.0s)]

*  the path to not do that thing that made you feel bad and not do that thing that made you hurt. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3670.0s)]
*  Like, don't do that, buddy. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3675.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3690.0s)]

*  Oh, they definitely do. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3714.0s)]

*  Falling off a skyscraper. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3721.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3722.0s)]
*  Landing on a baby carriage. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3723.0s)]
*  Understood. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3725.0s)]
*  But I remember like one of these kids because I had a... [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3726.0s)]
*  Don't do it, Jamie. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3730.0s)]
*  You son of a bitch. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3731.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3733.0s)]
*  This guy's barefoot climbing a fucking building. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3734.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3738.0s)]
*  Whoo! [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3739.0s)]
*  That is so wild that people do that shit. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3740.0s)]
*  You know, like... [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3743.0s)]
*  Don't do it, Jamie. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3744.0s)]
*  Don't make me... [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3745.0s)]
*  My hands are sweating. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3746.0s)]
*  Feel my hands. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3747.0s)]
*  Feel my hands. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3748.0s)]
*  How sweaty is that? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3749.0s)]
*  And I'll take this off of you because when I linked up with some of these kids that do [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3750.0s)]
*  all this fucking crazy parkour shit, like from building to building, and I reposted [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3757.0s)]
*  on my Instagram some kid doing some... [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3764.0s)]
*  It was like he jumped off one building and then landed on the next building by his fingers. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3767.0s)]
*  And people in the comments were like, just like, oh, this fucking stupid kid is fucking [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3774.0s)]
*  gonna die. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3780.0s)]
*  And I was kind of incensed. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3782.0s)]
*  And I went on my story and I was like, why is it that these kids are catching such fucking [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3784.0s)]
*  heat? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3792.0s)]
*  But then this other fucking guy wins an Oscar with a fucking free solo. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3793.0s)]
*  What's the difference? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3799.0s)]
*  Well, that's crazy too. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3800.0s)]
*  Alex has been on the podcast a few times. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3802.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3806.0s)]
*  I admire his ability to do that. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3807.0s)]
*  But also in talking to Gabor Mate, he was explaining that most likely what's going on [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3809.0s)]
*  is those people don't feel normal life the same way that we do. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3814.0s)]
*  And the only way for them to feel really connected and alive is to put themselves in grave danger. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3819.0s)]
*  It's just interesting to me that they're basically all doing the same thing. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3825.0s)]
*  Sort of. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3829.0s)]
*  But rock climbing is undoubtedly a learned skill. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3830.0s)]
*  And they have abilities that they have developed through... [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3835.0s)]
*  There's technical rock climbing. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3838.0s)]
*  Like they know what the fuck they're doing. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3840.0s)]
*  It's still... [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3842.0s)]
*  People die from it every year. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3843.0s)]
*  Did you see the Alpinist? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3845.0s)]
*  Is that the one where the guy... [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3847.0s)]
*  You don't even see it coming and then you find out that he died at the end. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3849.0s)]
*  Well, I saw it coming because I knew he was dead. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3853.0s)]
*  I didn't know. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3856.0s)]
*  And apologies to people who I just spoiled that for. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3858.0s)]
*  It's not spoiling. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3862.0s)]
*  It's pretty obvious when you watch it that he's going to die. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3863.0s)]
*  I mean, dude, it's heavy. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3866.0s)]
*  He was using ice picks and climbing on icicles. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3868.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that was such a great movie. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3872.0s)]
*  He decided that regular rock climbing wasn't scary enough. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3875.0s)]
*  And Alex talked about him admirably. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3880.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3884.0s)]
*  And I think that guy was so good, he was such a good climber, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3885.0s)]
*  that to him he needed really dangerous things to get him jazzed up. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3889.0s)]
*  So he would climb in Argentina, these mountains covered in ice in the winter. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3894.0s)]
*  And he got caught in a landslide or an avalanche. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3900.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3905.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3906.0s)]
*  And it wasn't like he screwed up. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3907.0s)]
*  They never even recovered his body. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3911.0s)]
*  It's part of the fucking glacier now. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3913.0s)]
*  Right, dude. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3915.0s)]
*  But when you climb, like for anybody who climbs Mount Everest, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3916.0s)]
*  don't you just climb past skeletal remains? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3921.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3924.0s)]
*  Yeah, they leave the bodies. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3925.0s)]
*  Yeah, you climb past them. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3927.0s)]
*  And they're white because they're basically just completely frozen solid. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3929.0s)]
*  And it's just like a white piece of meat. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3935.0s)]
*  And then the clothing is ripped apart. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3939.0s)]
*  So you can see the flesh underneath it that's hard as a rock. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3942.0s)]
*  So it's frozen all year round and never thaws? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3945.0s)]
*  Never thaws. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3948.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3949.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're just up there frozen like a rock forever. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3950.0s)]
*  And they leave the bodies there because it's too dangerous to bring them back. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3953.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are, like there's a dead guy that you pass by. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3957.0s)]
*  I mean, these people that are up there doing it, like look at that guy. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3962.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3966.0s)]
*  Yeah, died. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3967.0s)]
*  There's 200 bodies up there. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3969.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3970.0s)]
*  At least. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3971.0s)]
*  They don't know the official number. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3972.0s)]
*  Oh. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3973.0s)]
*  Over 300 people have died. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3974.0s)]
*  Motherfucker. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3975.0s)]
*  How many people die climbing Everest every year? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3976.0s)]
*  Over 300 total have died. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3979.0s)]
*  So I don't know about every year. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3980.0s)]
*  311, I said. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3982.0s)]
*  They die every year though. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3983.0s)]
*  You know what's fascinating to me is how like deliberate people are to avoid contemplating their own mortality. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3986.0s)]
*  This is a weird one. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3995.0s)]
*  The Everest one's a weird one. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3997.0s)]
*  Because it's also, it's like, I mean, I admire people that want to take challenges on and do things that are very difficult [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=3999.0s)]
*  because I'm just guessing that the sense of accomplishment after you do it is probably pretty extraordinary. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4010.0s)]
*  But on the other hand, like fuck man, passing by people who didn't make it. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4017.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4023.0s)]
*  You know, two climbers found a woman alone and dying, yelling, please don't leave me. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4024.0s)]
*  But were forced to continue and let her die as they had no means to help her and staying would risk their own lives. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4027.0s)]
*  They felt so guilty they spent years saving up enough money to finally return and give her a proper burial. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4032.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4038.0s)]
*  So what made them able to hang out with her the second time? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4039.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4043.0s)]
*  I know, right? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4044.0s)]
*  Hey, there's that lady that we didn't save. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4045.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4047.0s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4049.0s)]
*  Yeah, I read this story about this woman who climbed Mount Everest because she wanted to prove that being a vegan didn't make you weak. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4051.0s)]
*  And she died. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4058.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's another one. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4060.0s)]
*  Look at that body. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4063.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4064.0s)]
*  Frozen, pale, white. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4066.0s)]
*  The body was named Green Boots, perhaps the most well-known body on Everest. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4069.0s)]
*  His real name was Swang Pajor. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4075.0s)]
*  He died during the 1996 Mount Everest disaster while descending from the summit. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4081.0s)]
*  He was trapped in a blizzard and died due to exposure. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4086.0s)]
*  Is there another mountain that people die like crazy? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4090.0s)]
*  They die in K2. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4094.0s)]
*  Yeah, K2 kills a lot of people. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4095.0s)]
*  And then there's other mountains where like that's one of the things they covered in the Alpinist where like a quarter of the people who try to summit it die. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4097.0s)]
*  Man. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4104.0s)]
*  Yeah, these fucking people, man. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4107.0s)]
*  They just look at this. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4109.0s)]
*  Twenty nine percent fatality rate. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4111.0s)]
*  More than a quarter. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4113.0s)]
*  The main peak of Annapurna Massif is the most dangerous of the world's mountains with a twenty nine percent fatality rate of everyone who tries to climb it. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4114.0s)]
*  Since nineteen hundred an estimated two hundred and forty four expeditions have resulted in seventy two deaths. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4124.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4131.0s)]
*  And the next most dangerous, Kangchenjwana. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4132.0s)]
*  With a slightly higher death rate. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4137.0s)]
*  Twenty nine point one percent death rate. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4139.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4142.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4144.0s)]
*  Twenty nine percent. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4145.0s)]
*  K2 almost as dangerous. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4147.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4149.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4150.0s)]
*  Everest by contrast is a four percent fatality rate. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4151.0s)]
*  So Everest is for pussies. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4154.0s)]
*  What's wrong with people climbing it? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4156.0s)]
*  Still four percent. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4159.0s)]
*  You grow up with a hundred people. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4160.0s)]
*  Four of them are going to die. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4161.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4163.0s)]
*  I think that I think that so many people are just hyper focused on not like contemplating their mortality. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4164.0s)]
*  That like that they fail to live deliberately like while they're alive. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4177.0s)]
*  There's that there's an argument for that. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4184.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4186.0s)]
*  There's people that don't want to take any risks at all. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4187.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4189.0s)]
*  Listen I certainly take risks. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4190.0s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that you should take risks or anything like that. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4191.0s)]
*  I just think that by living with your blinders on you know like I have this theory that you know particularly in western civilization like like America where we live like actually being old. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4196.0s)]
*  Is like a fucking party foul. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4213.0s)]
*  You know people don't want to like people want to take elderly folks and just shut them into a nursing home and not deal with them not look at them like it's like old people serve as a reminder of your mortality and it just bums people out like being old as a party foul. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4215.0s)]
*  Well there's that but there's also people can't take care of people. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4237.0s)]
*  They don't have the ability if you're working full time and you have a career and a family and your father is unable to take care of himself anymore. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4241.0s)]
*  You're left with a limited amount of options. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4250.0s)]
*  Like what are you going to do. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4252.0s)]
*  Are you going to abandon your life for the next 10 years. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4254.0s)]
*  You take care of this person 24 hours a day or you're going to put him in some sort of a medical facility. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4256.0s)]
*  But then the big fear is that he gets abused there. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4262.0s)]
*  That is the saddest scariest shit when you see those videos of people getting abused in nursing homes like hidden camera footage of the last days of your life some young asshole is fucking smacking you in the head and shoving your face in food. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4265.0s)]
*  I haven't seen any of those videos. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4281.0s)]
*  Oh they're horrible. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4282.0s)]
*  Yeah and maybe it's not about putting people in nursing homes but I just think that there's a real like a real like like living with the blinders on like like I don't want to think about it. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4285.0s)]
*  I don't think about it. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4297.0s)]
*  La la la la. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4298.0s)]
*  And then you end up you know further down the road thinking like oh man why didn't I do this. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4299.0s)]
*  Why didn't I do that. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4305.0s)]
*  As opposed to really like being deliberate and living the life you would want to have lived when it's coming to an end. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4306.0s)]
*  Well I think it's also a learned thing to be able to take chances. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4316.0s)]
*  And if you go through your life and you get to maybe have a family and your family is your mother and your father or averse to risks and they play everything safe and then they drill it into your head to play it safe and then all of a sudden you're 35 you don't know how to do anything risky. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4321.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4339.0s)]
*  This is like the life you've always lived. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4340.0s)]
*  I mean there's how many people that just live the sedentary lifestyle and then just gelatinous blobs sitting in a chair every day. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4341.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4349.0s)]
*  And trying to avoid risk. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4350.0s)]
*  And by the way those are the people that freaked out the most when COVID came along. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4351.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4354.0s)]
*  Because they were really like genuinely vulnerable. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4355.0s)]
*  Whereas you know if you're an athlete and you're relatively healthy that was not something you were as terrified of and those people got mad at those people that weren't terrified. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4358.0s)]
*  Because for them it was literally like there was a demon waiting to get them because they were scared. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4369.0s)]
*  Because they did. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4374.0s)]
*  And the crazy thing was when those people got vaccinated they're like well I'm the smart one I've taken care of myself. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4375.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4381.0s)]
*  Bitch you live in a glass house. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4382.0s)]
*  Like your body is barely functional and you have no resiliency. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4385.0s)]
*  You know that vaccine it'll help you a little but you've got other problems. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4391.0s)]
*  Like you're obese and that is one of the number one causes of death. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4396.0s)]
*  Like the idea that you're going to be safe from danger because you got a COVID vaccine. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4400.0s)]
*  Like OK well maybe you'll be safer from COVID but you're still vulnerable as fuck if you're obese. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4407.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4413.0s)]
*  It is one of the worst things and it's 40 percent of the United States. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4414.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4417.0s)]
*  I mean somebody said this said you see super old people smoking cigarettes all the time. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4418.0s)]
*  Because they're like fuck it. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4428.0s)]
*  But how often do you see super old obese people? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4430.0s)]
*  You don't. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4434.0s)]
*  You don't. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4435.0s)]
*  You don't. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4436.0s)]
*  I mean when you put it in those terms it becomes very evident that obese. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4437.0s)]
*  Some people can just smoke for whatever reason. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4441.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4444.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4445.0s)]
*  Did you see that guy who Chinese guy is running marathons. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4446.0s)]
*  He ran a marathon in three and a half hours while smoking cigarettes. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4449.0s)]
*  So you can find that cat. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4454.0s)]
*  You got him. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4455.0s)]
*  I mean it's hilarious seeing this guy run. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4456.0s)]
*  He's running like really good times. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4458.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4460.0s)]
*  He's an older guy too. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4461.0s)]
*  Uncle Chen long distance chain smoking grandpa runs a marathon three point five hours. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4463.0s)]
*  So this dude is fucking chain smoking while he's running a marathon. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4470.0s)]
*  And he's a grandpa. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4475.0s)]
*  But he's running like a real good time. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4477.0s)]
*  Like three point five hours. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4480.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4482.0s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4483.0s)]
*  Back up. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4484.0s)]
*  Back up to that video. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4485.0s)]
*  That guy is younger than me by five years. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4486.0s)]
*  So fuck that. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4489.0s)]
*  I just changed my tune. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4491.0s)]
*  Some in way better shape than that guy. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4493.0s)]
*  That was like remember when we saw that old dude that got in a fight outside of the bar. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4495.0s)]
*  And I was like look at that old man. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4498.0s)]
*  Because they said he was like a 92 year old boxer and he's fucking these dudes up. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4499.0s)]
*  And then I found that he was younger than me. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4502.0s)]
*  He's actually only 53. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4504.0s)]
*  I was like oh well he's in terrible shape. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4505.0s)]
*  That time is pretty fast. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4507.0s)]
*  I was just looking at the New York City Marathon qualifying times. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4508.0s)]
*  And for a 40 to 40 year old you have to be under four hours. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4512.0s)]
*  And this is a half an hour faster than that. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4515.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4517.0s)]
*  No. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4518.0s)]
*  That's a legit time. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4519.0s)]
*  Like a really good marathon runner three hours is the goal right. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4520.0s)]
*  They want to get under three hours. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4522.0s)]
*  That guy's fucking hoofing it at 50 years old. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4524.0s)]
*  And he's smoking cigs the whole way. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4527.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4529.0s)]
*  It's better than being obese. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4531.0s)]
*  Fuck cigarettes. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4533.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4534.0s)]
*  Fuck all that stuff. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4535.0s)]
*  But look at him. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4536.0s)]
*  Healthy as fuck. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4538.0s)]
*  You know in Thailand a lot of the Thai fighters smoke cigarettes. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4539.0s)]
*  A lot of the Thai boxers they smoke and they drink and then they fight. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4543.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4547.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4548.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4549.0s)]
*  Super crazy. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4550.0s)]
*  So Dan I got to tell you about how I wrote about you in my new book. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4551.0s)]
*  You did? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4558.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4559.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4560.0s)]
*  I did. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4561.0s)]
*  Like just as an example where I was talking about how I got into standup and there were [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4562.0s)]
*  certain people were not like particularly supportive. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4568.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4572.0s)]
*  There's like I made an example about how I went on Mark Maron's podcast to promote my [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4573.0s)]
*  first special. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4580.0s)]
*  And there I was and he says you know I got to admit like I'm kind of a purist when it [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4582.0s)]
*  comes to standup. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4588.0s)]
*  And when I saw that you were doing standup I didn't like it. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4589.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4593.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking kind of like why is it the same. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4594.0s)]
*  He said the same thing to me when I first started doing standup. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4598.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4601.0s)]
*  Like. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4602.0s)]
*  Fuck off. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4603.0s)]
*  Like standup is an art form. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4604.0s)]
*  Anyone can do an art form. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4605.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4606.0s)]
*  And as I kind of like broke this down in my book sort of I said that I really believe [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4607.0s)]
*  that that's an example of somebody operating with a mentality of scarcity. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4615.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4623.0s)]
*  Where like the idea is that in reality these people are concerned that if Steve-O comes [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4624.0s)]
*  in to stand up and has success that that means that there is going to be less on the table [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4630.0s)]
*  from them. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4636.0s)]
*  It's going to take away from them. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4637.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4638.0s)]
*  There's not enough to go around. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4639.0s)]
*  And that this is their way of dealing with what they perceive as a threat. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4642.0s)]
*  And that's operating with the mentality of scarcity. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4648.0s)]
*  And then there's people like Joe Rogan who operate with a mentality of abundance where [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4651.0s)]
*  you're perfectly comfortable that there is enough to go around and you're not threatened [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4658.0s)]
*  by anything. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4662.0s)]
*  You actually encourage people to get into it. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4663.0s)]
*  And I just said that you know I'm so fucking grateful for that. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4665.0s)]
*  For the way that you supported me for the way that you support everybody and you just [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4670.0s)]
*  want there to be more funny shit in the world. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4674.0s)]
*  Well thank you. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4676.0s)]
*  But I think I encourage people to try things. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4677.0s)]
*  And look the idea that stand. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4680.0s)]
*  Look everyone talks stand up is talking and being funny while you're talking. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4681.0s)]
*  That's what it is like you tell stories you figure it out. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4685.0s)]
*  It's it's the idea that only one group of people should be able to do this and that [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4689.0s)]
*  it's our thing like fuck off. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4695.0s)]
*  The only people that think that way they lack self examination or they're using criticism [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4698.0s)]
*  to avoid looking at their own problems. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4704.0s)]
*  There's a great quote that I overuse but I'm going to say it one more time. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4707.0s)]
*  Most criticism is the tragic result of unmet needs. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4711.0s)]
*  They haven't done enough so they find flaws in other people that maybe don't even exist. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4715.0s)]
*  But the idea that you shouldn't be able to try stand up because they do it. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4721.0s)]
*  And it's my thing. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4726.0s)]
*  It's our thing. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4728.0s)]
*  Well first of all I think you'd be better at it if that was if that was your thing. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4729.0s)]
*  And second of all like this idea that no one else should be able to do it because they [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4733.0s)]
*  come from some other world or some other career or some other thing. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4737.0s)]
*  Look I don't give a fuck if you're a musician or like you're Dean Del Rey like he didn't [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4741.0s)]
*  even start doing it until he was in his 40s and he became a very good stand up. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4745.0s)]
*  You can anyone can do comedy. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4749.0s)]
*  You just you might not be able to like you look you might not have it in your head. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4751.0s)]
*  You might not have it in you. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4755.0s)]
*  But if you do I hope you do. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4757.0s)]
*  I support you. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4759.0s)]
*  It's a wonderful thing to be able to do to be able to go out in front of a group of people [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4760.0s)]
*  and make them all laugh and make them all feel better. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4765.0s)]
*  Why the fuck wouldn't you encourage more of that. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4767.0s)]
*  There's not that many of us. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4770.0s)]
*  If the idea that it's a fucking famine mentality boy what a famine it is then because there's [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4772.0s)]
*  only like a thousand of us on earth. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4778.0s)]
*  How many fucking professional stand ups are there. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4780.0s)]
*  There's a million doctors in America. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4783.0s)]
*  How many fucking stand ups are there. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4785.0s)]
*  There's so few that are like legitimate professional stand ups that can consistently churn out a [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4787.0s)]
*  new hour over the next few years and perform in front of live audiences on a regular basis [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4794.0s)]
*  and kill. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4800.0s)]
*  There's so few. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4801.0s)]
*  There's so fucking few. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4802.0s)]
*  The idea that you wouldn't encourage that would you want the art form to die off. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4803.0s)]
*  You know because like it kind of almost did during covid. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4807.0s)]
*  I mean covid got weird. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4811.0s)]
*  You know people were doing zoom stand up and people were doing stand up behind the glass [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4812.0s)]
*  and drive in. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4816.0s)]
*  Well you know Burt did that and that actually worked. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4818.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4821.0s)]
*  Bill Burt was telling me about doing that. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4822.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4823.0s)]
*  Burt did those. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4824.0s)]
*  A lot of people did outdoor shows. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4825.0s)]
*  Look I did a lot of outdoor shows during the pandemic with Chappelle. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4826.0s)]
*  We did it at Stubbs in town which is like this outside amphitheater. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4829.0s)]
*  But we did like you know covid bubble tested everybody tested the entire crowd. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4832.0s)]
*  So you had to get there half an hour before you got seated and everybody got tested. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4837.0s)]
*  But the idea that like you shouldn't do it and it's my thing. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4841.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4846.0s)]
*  That's just a stupid person. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4847.0s)]
*  I'm so fucking glad I did it dude. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4848.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4850.0s)]
*  You should be glad. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4851.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4852.0s)]
*  Isn't it great. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4853.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4854.0s)]
*  Like when I started out doing it and dude it's crazy I've been doing I started touring in [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4855.0s)]
*  2010. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4862.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4863.0s)]
*  You're 12 years in a comedy now. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4864.0s)]
*  Isn't that wild. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4865.0s)]
*  Super wild. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4866.0s)]
*  The first time I tried stand up was 2006. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4867.0s)]
*  So like way long but I've only been like really like like in earnest touring for since 2010. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4870.0s)]
*  There's a thing that comics also do where they don't treat beginners like their comics [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4878.0s)]
*  and I'm opposed to that too. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4883.0s)]
*  Well first of all I'm a martial artist. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4885.0s)]
*  So I come from this mentality where you're always encouraging people to try because even [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4887.0s)]
*  if you're never going to be very good at martial arts it will be very good for you. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4893.0s)]
*  I think it's going to benefit you to try to get better at this difficult thing because [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4898.0s)]
*  it is a vehicle for developing your human potential. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4901.0s)]
*  I feel like everything that you do that is difficult is a vehicle for developing your [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4904.0s)]
*  human potential whether it's learning how to play chess learning a new language writing [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4908.0s)]
*  a book anything you do that's difficult allows you to confront your character flaws and allows [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4912.0s)]
*  you to confront your discipline issues allows you to confront all the thoughts that are [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4918.0s)]
*  in your mind that maybe you haven't properly organized and it gives you a chance to expand [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4923.0s)]
*  a chance to excel at life. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4927.0s)]
*  And for people that don't understand that I don't get that they're generally selfish [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4930.0s)]
*  or narcissistic there's something wrong with them that they don't see that a person who [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4934.0s)]
*  is attempting to do this difficult thing should be encouraged because like if you're just [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4939.0s)]
*  because you started when you're 35 as opposed to starting when you're 21 or what nonsense [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4945.0s)]
*  like I met a woman who she started doing jujitsu when she was 58 years old and she got her [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4950.0s)]
*  black belt in her 60s. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4956.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4957.0s)]
*  That's an amazing accomplishment. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4958.0s)]
*  Now is that lady going to go to the UFC and fuck everybody up? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4959.0s)]
*  No. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4963.0s)]
*  So if she shouldn't should she not be encouraged? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4964.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4966.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4967.0s)]
*  And the idea that like it belongs to like the youth or belongs to people who have been [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4968.0s)]
*  in the arts their whole life that's nonsense. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4973.0s)]
*  It's such a foolish way of approaching life. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4975.0s)]
*  And it's also like you're defining yourself in this very egotistical way and like that [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4979.0s)]
*  you're a purist and you're a purveyor of the truth and you're the only way that this should [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4985.0s)]
*  be done is my way. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4991.0s)]
*  Nonsense. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4993.0s)]
*  Pure nonsense by fools. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4994.0s)]
*  Only a fool would think that way. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4997.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=4999.0s)]
*  To what you're saying about the martial arts I really feel strongly that skateboarding [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5000.0s)]
*  instilled in me like the most crucial shit in life. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5008.0s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5012.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5013.0s)]
*  It's super fucking hard. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5014.0s)]
*  It's fucking hard to do. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5015.0s)]
*  Like 1985 the Back to the Future movie came out. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5016.0s)]
*  I was in sixth grade and I saw Michael J. Fox holding onto the back of the fucking car [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5020.0s)]
*  cruising around. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5025.0s)]
*  I saw the skateboard tricks in the movie and I was like dude I got a, every kid thought, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5026.0s)]
*  I got a fucking truck. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5030.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5031.0s)]
*  There was a fucking skateboard underneath every goddamn Christmas tree that year and [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5032.0s)]
*  like every kid had a skateboard. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5038.0s)]
*  It was the wildest fad ever. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5040.0s)]
*  And in short order every kid found out how fucking hard it was to ride this goddamn [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5042.0s)]
*  thing. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5048.0s)]
*  Every kid trying to ride it fell down and hurt themselves. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5049.0s)]
*  Like at least 90% of these kids fucking, like these skateboards went totally unused. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5052.0s)]
*  And the kids that didn't like put it away, the kids that stuck with it, I mean right [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5059.0s)]
*  there dude that is a white hot core of just the fucking persistence, dedication, like [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5065.0s)]
*  fucking sacrifice. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5074.0s)]
*  Like skateboarding weeds out pussies and quitters and just isolates kids who will... [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5077.0s)]
*  Figure it out. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5086.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5088.0s)]
*  Just put effort and fucking tenacity. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5089.0s)]
*  And on top of that, like with the getting hurt and the fucking doing the sacrifice, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5093.0s)]
*  and then on top of that everything that you're riding your skateboard on you're effectively [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5101.0s)]
*  fucking vandalizing. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5106.0s)]
*  So like you know it's like... [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5107.0s)]
*  Rebellion. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5109.0s)]
*  There's like a criminal fucking like piece to it, this like anti-authority piece to it. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5110.0s)]
*  There's just this like... [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5115.0s)]
*  And even further, there's no other activity in the world that lent itself to documenting [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5118.0s)]
*  what you're doing with a video camera. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5126.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5128.0s)]
*  So like skateboarders got a super leg up on video production. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5129.0s)]
*  Like Spike Jonze's very first video project was a skateboard video. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5134.0s)]
*  No kidding. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5140.0s)]
*  He started out as a photographer for a skateboard company. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5141.0s)]
*  And the guy in charge of that skateboard company decided that he wanted to make a video [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5145.0s)]
*  because that was like in the 80s. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5149.0s)]
*  Like this was like what was putting companies in front of other companies. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5151.0s)]
*  It's like, man, I want to make a video. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5154.0s)]
*  He didn't have anybody to make the video. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5156.0s)]
*  He just had Spike Jonze who was a photographer. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5158.0s)]
*  And Spike got that job by default. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5160.0s)]
*  And that was the 1980s. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5163.0s)]
*  It was his first video project. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5166.0s)]
*  And then boom, look at him. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5168.0s)]
*  He's fucking got Oscars and shit. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5169.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5171.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5172.0s)]
*  I support people doing things that are difficult because I think through doing things that are difficult, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5173.0s)]
*  you learn about yourself. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5177.0s)]
*  You know, there's this my right arm. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5179.0s)]
*  I have a tattoo of Miyamoto Musashi because I read a quote when I was 16 years old when I was doing martial arts. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5181.0s)]
*  I read the Book of Five Rings. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5190.0s)]
*  And this is that that's Miyamoto Musashi on my right arm. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5192.0s)]
*  And he wrote this book, the Book of Five Rings, which was a book on strategy. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5197.0s)]
*  And Miyamoto Musashi was a samurai who killed 62 men in one on one combat. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5202.0s)]
*  And he wrote this quote, wrote this incredible book about it. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5209.0s)]
*  But one of the one of the things he wrote in the book was once you understand the way broadly, you can see it in all things. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5213.0s)]
*  And I think that all difficult things are development. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5220.0s)]
*  They aid you in developing your human potential. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5224.0s)]
*  And you find a way to get out of your own way by getting good at all kinds of things. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5227.0s)]
*  You cut through the bullshit. You think you're great at skateboarding. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5232.0s)]
*  No, you're not. You suck at it. You got to get better at it. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5235.0s)]
*  And the only way to get better at it is to practice it until you get better at it. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5237.0s)]
*  And then you find that way. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5240.0s)]
*  And in that way of getting better at that, you could apply that to playing the piano. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5242.0s)]
*  You could apply that to playing chess. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5246.0s)]
*  Everything you could apply it to everything. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5248.0s)]
*  And that that's why I have this tattoo. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5249.0s)]
*  That's what it means to me. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5251.0s)]
*  It's like this this idea is that difficult things are tools. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5252.0s)]
*  They're tools to maximize the way your mind interacts with life. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5259.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5263.0s)]
*  Yes, whether it's stand up or learning how to play guitar or whatever it is, you can get better at things. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5266.0s)]
*  And when I see a guy who's a comic and they're an open mic'er and they they get a couple of laughs on stage, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5272.0s)]
*  I treat them the same way I treat a headliner or the same way I treat someone who I work with on the road. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5279.0s)]
*  That's a comic. I don't say you're not a comic yet. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5285.0s)]
*  You're not a comic yet. You're certainly not good yet. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5288.0s)]
*  But that's OK. That's the same as a white belt. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5291.0s)]
*  If I see someone who's a white belt in Jiu Jitsu, I don't say, oh, you fucking suck. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5293.0s)]
*  You're not even good yet. You don't even black belt. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5297.0s)]
*  Right. It takes a while to get good. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5299.0s)]
*  But if you keep going, you'll get good. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5301.0s)]
*  I try to encourage people. It's fucking getting good at stand up takes a long time. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5303.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah it does. It keeps going to you keep getting better. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5307.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, 100 percent. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5310.0s)]
*  The for me when I first started, it felt like such a departure from, you know, like, like, you know, I've been doing this this jackass shit. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5312.0s)]
*  Now I'm going to do stand up and it's going to be separate, you know, and I'm just going to devote myself to it. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5324.0s)]
*  I'm going to work to establish myself in it. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5329.0s)]
*  And it was just me in the microphone. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5332.0s)]
*  And I would do like, you know, I would have like a set of stand up and then I would do like a set of like silly circus tricks, you know, like whatever. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5334.0s)]
*  And like have that be part of my show. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5343.0s)]
*  And I did my first special. It came out in 2016. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5345.0s)]
*  And I can't watch that shit. It's course. It's so gnarly. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5351.0s)]
*  Like this whole like I had this thing like with fucking. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5356.0s)]
*  Is that when Tim Kennedy choked you unconscious? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5360.0s)]
*  I told you not to do that, too. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5363.0s)]
*  Well, it would have been fine, except I told him to drop me. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5365.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not good. You get a head injury. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5368.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5370.0s)]
*  But but then what happened was really interesting. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5372.0s)]
*  After after I taped that special, then I went to go put together my next hour. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5377.0s)]
*  And as I was putting together that that second hour, it occurred to me one night that the stories that I was telling comprising this new act of were things that largely happened on video camera. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5383.0s)]
*  So then I thought that I thought, oh, my God, what if my what if my next special in post production? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5396.0s)]
*  I interstitially edit in the footage of the stories unfolding. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5404.0s)]
*  So then like it's got a multimedia quality. Yeah, that's great. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5409.0s)]
*  Dude, my head exploded. I got so fucking excited about it. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5413.0s)]
*  And then what what what happened next was I had to see it to see if it worked. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5416.0s)]
*  So I started recording my my sets and then editing the footage into it. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5422.0s)]
*  And this was like the biggest thing for me, because prior to that, I just resisted studying footage of my standup. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5429.0s)]
*  Like a lot of a lot of comics have a lot of trouble watching footage of their performance. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5439.0s)]
*  It just makes you want to come makes you cringe. Yeah. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5444.0s)]
*  And and and and that all went away because I had this idea. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5447.0s)]
*  Like I got to see what what editing the foot. So it forced me to to study my my standup. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5453.0s)]
*  You know, like I record my sense. I put it in the computer and I like bring in the footage and do it. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5461.0s)]
*  I saw it right away. I'm like, this fucking works. This is epic. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5467.0s)]
*  And and and the way that that forced me to study footage of my standup, like the craziest thing, the things that made me cringe. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5471.0s)]
*  I addressed them. It's better. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5480.0s)]
*  It sped up the progression of my standup so, so much by studying it. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5485.0s)]
*  And and the best thing, too, was that for the next couple of years that, you know, that I toured with that hour, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5491.0s)]
*  I did not have the footage with me on the road as like a crutch to lean on. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5500.0s)]
*  Like it like for that whole tour, it was just me in the microphone and the shows were like successful in their own right. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5505.0s)]
*  You know, like I got through it just me in the microphone. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5512.0s)]
*  No benefit. And the footage came in and post production. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5515.0s)]
*  And so then I I put out that that special. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5519.0s)]
*  And like as as far as I know, that was the world's first fucking multimedia standup comedy special. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5523.0s)]
*  I put it out on my own website and I fucking killed it. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5531.0s)]
*  That was when I duct taped myself to the billboard. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5534.0s)]
*  You ever see that? Yeah, I did. Yeah. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5536.0s)]
*  That was to promote that, you know, me putting out my own special. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5538.0s)]
*  And I was fucking super successful with it. That's awesome. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5542.0s)]
*  But when I but by the time I put that out, then I had like two like really big things that that were kind of irking me was that like up to that point, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5546.0s)]
*  my standup had been an exercise in living in the past. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5558.0s)]
*  It's just like, oh, you know, old footage, like old fucking memory lane shit. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5562.0s)]
*  I felt like I was turning into a schmuck like who won't shut up about what he could bench press in high school. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5567.0s)]
*  Oh, right. Al Bundy talking about the high school football days. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5572.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. So I saw what I wanted to do next for the third hour. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5576.0s)]
*  What was to like create all new content, new material that's current. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5581.0s)]
*  And I wanted to bring footage with me on the road. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5590.0s)]
*  So I said about I said about like taping like new high level ass shit. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5593.0s)]
*  And what was so what's so rad about is that over the last 12 years, like my various worlds have all just converged into one. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5600.0s)]
*  So now when you go see me on tour, you're seeing me perform standup. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5609.0s)]
*  I tell a story. And then after I get done telling that story, then I screen the footage. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5614.0s)]
*  Oh, so you're added in the actual audience. The audience sees it, too. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5621.0s)]
*  Now the footage comes with me. That's a great idea. It's a great idea. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5626.0s)]
*  Look, the idea that you should only do stand up one way is also stupid. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5629.0s)]
*  It works so fucking well for me. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5633.0s)]
*  You have so many different fucking things you've done. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5636.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, so few people have that many extreme experience. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5639.0s)]
*  You almost got killed by lions. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5642.0s)]
*  You know, who fucking say that? There's so many experiences that you have like that. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5645.0s)]
*  Yeah. So, dude, I'm just really, really excited about this. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5650.0s)]
*  My new tour is called The Bucket List. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5654.0s)]
*  And like the bucket list is just these the most preposterous fucking ideas that I ever came up with. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5657.0s)]
*  And I never expected that I would do any of them. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5665.0s)]
*  And then at a certain point, I was just like, fuck it, dude. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5668.0s)]
*  That's like the shit that hasn't been done. I'm going to do it. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5670.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, man, like I've got I've got to let people know. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5673.0s)]
*  I graduated from comedy clubs after 11 years and comedy clubs made it to theaters. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5678.0s)]
*  Now I'm traveling on a tour bus and like the whole deal. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5685.0s)]
*  It's just fucking it's exploded. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5690.0s)]
*  And I've got I've got a bunch of dates in December starting November 29th in Philly. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5692.0s)]
*  I got in New York like all around. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5700.0s)]
*  I'm doing a run of the US in December. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5702.0s)]
*  So when you do stand up, are you doing mostly talking about stories or do you just make observations to do you talk about different things about life? [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5706.0s)]
*  It's absolutely storytelling. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5716.0s)]
*  But but I'm going for like maximum last per minute. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5719.0s)]
*  You know, like it's it's all about building jokes into the stories. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5723.0s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5727.0s)]
*  So when you write, are you do you sit down physically and write or do you like say I have this story? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5729.0s)]
*  Let me figure out how to make this story better on stage. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5736.0s)]
*  Like, how are you doing? It'll work different ways. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5739.0s)]
*  Sometimes I'll write it. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5742.0s)]
*  Sometimes I'll just go out and have the experience, you know, like I'll have like the crazy idea for for whatever the stunt is and I'll go and film it. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5743.0s)]
*  And then have having filmed it, then I'll go to the comedy store and just take 10 minutes to just work on that chunk. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5757.0s)]
*  And so when you go on the road, are you bringing traditional standups to open for you or are you just going out by yourself? [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5765.0s)]
*  How are you doing that? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5771.0s)]
*  I've done it all different ways. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5772.0s)]
*  I've had I've like I bring the guys from Jackass. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5775.0s)]
*  Some of them just had we man with me in Canada. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5781.0s)]
*  And that's that's a hoot. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5784.0s)]
*  You know, I'll cycle in like like dudes from Jackass for a while. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5787.0s)]
*  I had my tour manager like who's just terrified of public speaking. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5793.0s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, I'm going to make you do it. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5797.0s)]
*  And he did stand up. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5800.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5801.0s)]
*  He would tell the audience. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5802.0s)]
*  But he only did like five minutes. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5806.0s)]
*  The thing was that at that point, at that point, we still had like we were in comedy clubs still. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5810.0s)]
*  And the comedy club would like bring in someone like to be a feature. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5819.0s)]
*  And like there was like no pertinence to it. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5826.0s)]
*  You know, it was like you've got this random guy doing like random material about it. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5830.0s)]
*  And I thought like, man, why why why not fucking have my guy do it? [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5834.0s)]
*  Make him and plus the other thing, too, was that he started out my tour managers and now my business partner started out as my professional cock blocker. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5840.0s)]
*  Because, you know, I I had some serious. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5854.0s)]
*  Yeah, we talked about this the last time you were here. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5859.0s)]
*  Yeah, you needed someone to keep you from going on a rampage. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5861.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5865.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's the same mindset that would make you a drug addict. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5866.0s)]
*  It's the same thing for sure. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5870.0s)]
*  For sure. So the fact that he could go out on stage and be like, oh, well, we met in sex addict rehab. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5871.0s)]
*  Like, it's like pretty pretty fucking funny. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5878.0s)]
*  There there there was a lot built into it that made that make sense. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5881.0s)]
*  Isn't it interesting how the mind works, how the same thing that would make you a sex addict would also make you get really good at comedy? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5885.0s)]
*  Because you obsess on things and then you just try to get more of it. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5893.0s)]
*  Like, what is it? How do I how do I get those laughs? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5898.0s)]
*  How do I figure it out? How I present it to people that it's funnier and get that get those pops? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5900.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's crazy. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5905.0s)]
*  It's crazy. Some things you think are going to work so well don't work. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5907.0s)]
*  And then other things that like. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5910.0s)]
*  But you figured it out. Some people never figured out. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5912.0s)]
*  That's the saddest shit. The saddest shit is that people there's comics that look, I'm all for everyone trying comedy. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5915.0s)]
*  But some people don't ever get it. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5922.0s)]
*  They never get it. And I don't know why. I don't know what it is. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5925.0s)]
*  Some people get it. Like I saw guys that used to struggle like Sebastian used to struggle. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5929.0s)]
*  He's a struggle. And then one day I was I hadn't seen him in a while because, you know, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5934.0s)]
*  I got kicked out of the comedy store in 2007 and I was on the road and I was in Vegas. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5939.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I was in Vegas for a UFC. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5943.0s)]
*  I was alone in my hotel room watching TV just flipping through the channels and Showtime came on and Sebastian was on. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5945.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, look at Sebastian's got a special and it was fucking great. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5951.0s)]
*  It was really funny. And I remember tweeting it saying how fucking funny it is. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5955.0s)]
*  And I got a hold of him. I said, dude, that was awesome. I just loved it. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5959.0s)]
*  I loved it. He found his confidence. He found that thing, whatever it is, that swagger. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5963.0s)]
*  He figured it out. Dude, how good is fucking Ari's Jews special? It's amazing. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5969.0s)]
*  It's amazing. I'm so fucking impressed by that. I'm so happy for him. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5975.0s)]
*  I'm so happy for him because that was something that he worked on for a long time. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5979.0s)]
*  Evidently. I mean, dude, it's like really good. Fucking really good. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5983.0s)]
*  And it's getting really, really well received. And he's at like more than three million downloads now. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5988.0s)]
*  It's three million, two hundred twenty seven thousand nine hundred ninety six. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5995.0s)]
*  Amazing. And that's only in two weeks. It's incredible. Not even two weeks. Thirteen days. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=5999.0s)]
*  Every day more and more people are watching it. It's really fucking good. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6004.0s)]
*  And he worked really hard on it. And that's a thing, man. You can fucking get better at stuff if you can do it. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6008.0s)]
*  But the thing is like comedy is with it's a weird thing. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6013.0s)]
*  You know, I encourage like I encourage everyone to get try martial arts. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6016.0s)]
*  The difference is with martial arts, you might always suck and you're going to try to get better. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6020.0s)]
*  But at least there's like techniques that you can use that everybody uses with comedy. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6026.0s)]
*  It's your own mind. Yeah. It's like you seeing the world. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6032.0s)]
*  It's like you can't really mean you really shouldn't use other people's premises and try to copy their shit. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6035.0s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. It's a fucking problem with people. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6040.0s)]
*  We've had problems with people where, like, you know, they'll like guys opening for guys will start doing bits on the same subject these people cover after they even setting them up the same way. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6043.0s)]
*  Like I had to talk to a guy about it recently. My came motherfucker. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6054.0s)]
*  You got to stop doing that. Like you're you're literally you're you're this is like a name. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6057.0s)]
*  You're in the neighborhood of stealing because you're working for a guy and you're doing his premises before he does them. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6061.0s)]
*  Yes. It's called stepping on premises. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6067.0s)]
*  I'm I'm happy to report that that is not a concern. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6070.0s)]
*  But my point is it like for some people, they just can't do it for whatever reason. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6075.0s)]
*  I don't know why. That's the bummer. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6081.0s)]
*  Because like even though I'm encouraging people to stand up, there's like certain people that like want to do sets on my shows. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6083.0s)]
*  I'm like, no, I can't have you on. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6089.0s)]
*  Like you're just not good. Like how do you say that to someone? [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6092.0s)]
*  You put me in a position where you're asking me to perform on my show, but I can't have you on or I'll have you on once or twice. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6095.0s)]
*  And then I'm like, this is not right. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6101.0s)]
*  You can't do this. It's the worst. It's horrible. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6103.0s)]
*  When you've got someone opening for you that's not doing a good job. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6106.0s)]
*  It's the bummer. So uncomfortable. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6110.0s)]
*  And it's another thing that people who suck do. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6112.0s)]
*  They like to take people on the road with them who suck because they want they want to come in and rescue them. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6114.0s)]
*  People that are like mildly competent, they want to bring like the worst opening acts so that this audience has to suffer through 20 minutes of nonsense. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6120.0s)]
*  Well, right. A lot of people are threatened by someone getting on there and killing it. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6128.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's another famine mentality thing. I try to bring the best fucking people I can find. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6134.0s)]
*  I try to bring just straight up killers, headliners. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6139.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's that's it. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6142.0s)]
*  Ian Edwards. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6144.0s)]
*  Yeah, everybody. All this Joey Diaz. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6145.0s)]
*  I brought Ari on the road to me for years. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6147.0s)]
*  Tom Segura. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6149.0s)]
*  Doing stand up with other people that are really funny makes you better. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6150.0s)]
*  It's like iron sharpens iron. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6154.0s)]
*  You can go over jokes together. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6156.0s)]
*  You can talk about approaches like, hey, you know, that first set, I did it this way, but I think I'm going to do it that way. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6159.0s)]
*  And they're like, oh, I have a bit where I did it fucked up for a while, but then I figured this out. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6165.0s)]
*  And that's the beauty of the art form is that this is weird puzzle that you're trying to put together. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6169.0s)]
*  And you're trying to like work it all out in front of live audience members. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6175.0s)]
*  Like I'm in this weird place right now where I'm writing all this new shit because I've just filmed a special. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6179.0s)]
*  So now I'm trying to piece together a whole new hour. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6184.0s)]
*  And like I have these premises that are like infants. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6186.0s)]
*  They can barely walk toddler premises and trying to find like where the beats are. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6189.0s)]
*  And you've got to let them grow just like a toddler. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6194.0s)]
*  You've got to let them fucking develop muscles and figure out coordination. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6197.0s)]
*  You've got to put together these things. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6202.0s)]
*  And it's a challenge. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6204.0s)]
*  One of the unique things about stand up is every time you release a special or you record a special, then you have to start from scratch. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6206.0s)]
*  You know, like my manager was talking to me about doing new tour dates. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6213.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not doing shit for a long time. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6217.0s)]
*  Like I'm not doing shit for months. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6219.0s)]
*  I'm doing local shows where I can do old shit and then fuck around with new shit. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6220.0s)]
*  And then once I release my special, then there's no more of that old stuff that's dead to me. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6224.0s)]
*  For sure. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6228.0s)]
*  You've got to write and you've got to figure it out. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6229.0s)]
*  And you know, it's hard. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6232.0s)]
*  But that challenge makes you new. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6234.0s)]
*  You have the benefit of being almost like a beginner. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6238.0s)]
*  You have an understanding of how to make things funny. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6242.0s)]
*  But you're a beginner in the sense that you don't have formed bits anymore. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6244.0s)]
*  You don't have any weapons. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6247.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6249.0s)]
*  I took eight months off chunking together my new hour. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6250.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6255.0s)]
*  And it's almost time to do that again. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6256.0s)]
*  It's a lot of work. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6259.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6260.0s)]
*  But it's exciting. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6261.0s)]
*  And it's also humbling. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6262.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6263.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing about comedy that doesn't exist in music. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6264.0s)]
*  If you are a band that had some big hits, you could tour forever with those hits. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6267.0s)]
*  People get excited. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6272.0s)]
*  If you try to tour forever with some old stand up, unless you're Dice Clay. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6273.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6277.0s)]
*  Because those rhymes. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6278.0s)]
*  He would just do that at the end. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6279.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6281.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6282.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6283.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6284.0s)]
*  The fact is when everyone knew his material, they still wanted to come see him in arenas. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6285.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6290.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6291.0s)]
*  I mean, that is a ... But that's just a completely different form of comedy that he was doing. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6292.0s)]
*  He figured this new thing out. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6297.0s)]
*  Like the nursery rhyme thing was a crazy thing where the audience knew the punch line and [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6299.0s)]
*  they would chant it out with him and they were excited to do that. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6304.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6308.0s)]
*  What's in the bowl, bitch? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6309.0s)]
*  Oh! [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6310.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6311.0s)]
*  And everybody would go crazy. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6312.0s)]
*  I bet there's not another example of that. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6313.0s)]
*  I don't know of another example. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6316.0s)]
*  There's a few guys that have bits like with Burt Kreischer, he has to tell that machine [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6317.0s)]
*  story where people blow a gasket. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6321.0s)]
*  With Jim Gaffigan, it's like the Hot Pockets thing. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6323.0s)]
*  Oh, Jim Brewer's got the thing with the alcohol. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6326.0s)]
*  The thing with the alcohol? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6332.0s)]
*  Yeah, the thing with the ... Fuck, what is it? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6333.0s)]
*  Where it's like he's got different types of alcohol. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6335.0s)]
*  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6339.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6340.0s)]
*  And then you're like, everybody out. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6341.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a great bit. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6342.0s)]
*  But Jim is a rare talent, man. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6346.0s)]
*  He's one of the most underappreciated stand-up comics alive because Jim can take a premise [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6348.0s)]
*  about things that just happened and he's so naturally funny. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6354.0s)]
*  It's not natural in that sense that he hasn't worked at it because he most certainly has, [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6358.0s)]
*  but he has this ability to like a thing goes on in the news and then he'll just go on stage [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6363.0s)]
*  and he'll have fucking 10 minutes on it and it'll be hilarious because he just has a hilarious [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6370.0s)]
*  way of looking at life. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6375.0s)]
*  He's a guy that like ... And he's also ... He doesn't have an ego. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6377.0s)]
*  He's not a guy that looks at himself like he's a special person in any way. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6382.0s)]
*  He just does ... He gets out of his own way and just finds the funny and shit. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6388.0s)]
*  People that can't get out of their own way that are always concerned about their image, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6393.0s)]
*  always concerned about how other people see them, like, boy, that's a fucking weight you're carrying around. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6397.0s)]
*  It's such a handicap. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6401.0s)]
*  It's so bad. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6403.0s)]
*  It just gets in your way and comedy is all about getting out of your own way. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6405.0s)]
*  It's all about being funny, but it's also about finding the funny without you being in the way of it. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6411.0s)]
*  And that's one of the things where getting good at things teaches you. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6419.0s)]
*  Getting good at things teaches you the path to getting good at things. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6423.0s)]
*  And if you're a person that's all you've done is stand up or all you've done is whatever the art form is. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6427.0s)]
*  And your whole self-identity is based on you being good at this thing. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6432.0s)]
*  You can't wait to show everybody how good you are at this thing. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6439.0s)]
*  Like, ugh, God. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6442.0s)]
*  It's so exhausting and so unnecessary. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6445.0s)]
*  It's such a burden to carry around. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6447.0s)]
*  Jim Brewer doesn't have any of that. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6449.0s)]
*  He just goes on stage and just fucking, gah, fucking, gah, and just has fun. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6451.0s)]
*  And with the heavy metal shit so fucking funny. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6456.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6459.0s)]
*  He's just a funny dude, man. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6460.0s)]
*  I ate it going on after him once more than I've ever eaten it going on after anybody in my whole life. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6461.0s)]
*  I was like three years into comedy. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6466.0s)]
*  We were working together. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6467.0s)]
*  And he was middling and I was headlining and I really shouldn't have been headlining. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6468.0s)]
*  It was just like one of those days where, you know, you'd just get gigs back then. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6472.0s)]
*  And we were doing this weekend together. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6476.0s)]
*  And I did OK every show except the last one Saturday night. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6478.0s)]
*  I hate shit. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6482.0s)]
*  But that eating shit made me go, I'm like, OK, can't do that. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6484.0s)]
*  Like, what was I doing wrong? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6489.0s)]
*  What are these bits? [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6491.0s)]
*  Where's the fat in these bits? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6492.0s)]
*  Let me cut that out. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6494.0s)]
*  Let me tighten these up. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6495.0s)]
*  That's where writing. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6496.0s)]
*  Make them better. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6497.0s)]
*  I think that actually like typing up material comes after working on it. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6498.0s)]
*  For me, I think it's most effective. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6507.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a bunch of different ways. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6510.0s)]
*  The whole idea is just ideas, right? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6511.0s)]
*  The whole idea is like finding these premises and these thoughts and then just molding them into something that's really good. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6513.0s)]
*  And people do it different ways. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6521.0s)]
*  I know a lot of really good comics who never write anything down. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6523.0s)]
*  They just keep it in their head and they fuck with it in their head and they go on stage and they keep going on stage and they do a lot of sets. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6526.0s)]
*  Like Ari, most of the stuff he does, he doesn't write. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6532.0s)]
*  Like he just has these premises and he works them out in front of crowds and he just continues to improve on those premises until it becomes a functional bit. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6535.0s)]
*  But then there's other people that where everything they do, they write out almost like a monologue and then they kind of tighten it out with tighten it up with the audience. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6544.0s)]
*  Like Chris Rock will have a record a set, then send it to someone who types it up and then sends back the word document and then he'll go through the word document. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6553.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, Chris has always like he also has famously employed other comics like Rich Genny was one of the best ones that he brought on the road with him. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6569.0s)]
*  And he would have Rich watch his set and then afterwards they would talk about it. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6579.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6583.0s)]
*  You know, Rich would give him his advice or his opinion. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6584.0s)]
*  So when you have someone who's a peer, who's also like a top level comic and they actually have a job and their job is to sit down and watch you and then you brainstorm afterwards. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6587.0s)]
*  That's a great benefit, too. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6597.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people that don't do that. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6599.0s)]
*  I think Chris is brilliant in that regard that he did that. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6601.0s)]
*  It's like a good it's a sign of a healthy ego, too, because he's willing to bring people in to say like you would hire like two or three guys like Rich Voss. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6604.0s)]
*  I think he did it with Nick DiPaolo and he had these guys and they would go and sit and watch him and then, you know, they would sit down and talk about it afterwards. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6612.0s)]
*  They'd have dinner or something like that and they'd go over the set and then Chris would make notes and think about what they said and think about the way he felt. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6621.0s)]
*  You know, then he rewrite things and reformulate things and Chris would go on stage and not try not to kill, too. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6630.0s)]
*  He would go on stage purposely to try to find those uncomfortable moments where you like had to find the funny like he put himself out there. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6638.0s)]
*  You know, where he was like out on a limb and like you're fucked. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6647.0s)]
*  The audience is waiting for you to say something. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6651.0s)]
*  And then something would eventually come and maybe it wouldn't. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6653.0s)]
*  And maybe it would. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6656.0s)]
*  And but the ones that did. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6657.0s)]
*  Then he kept that. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6658.0s)]
*  OK, I got something now. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6659.0s)]
*  And then but you have to be willing to try new things to do that. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6660.0s)]
*  And one of the things that happens to comics, once they start doing well, this is a real danger for young comics. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6664.0s)]
*  They'll put together like 15 minutes. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6671.0s)]
*  That's good. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6673.0s)]
*  And then they go up at the store and they'll have a really solid 15 minutes that they never develop another. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6674.0s)]
*  They never expand. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6679.0s)]
*  They know they don't ever try new stuff in there because they only have 15 minutes. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6681.0s)]
*  They want to kill their sandwiched in between Jeff Ross and Anthony Jessel neck. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6684.0s)]
*  And they don't want a bomb. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6688.0s)]
*  So they don't try new stuff. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6689.0s)]
*  I mean, dude, for the longest time, I was terrified of doing stand up in L.A. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6691.0s)]
*  Because the same thing. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6698.0s)]
*  You know, I want I want I want to kill. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6702.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, if I want to fucking, you know, work on material, I'll be doing that when I'm in fucking the funny bone in fucking Oklahoma. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6704.0s)]
*  You can do that, too. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6713.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6715.0s)]
*  But I think you got to figure out a way to work it in. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6716.0s)]
*  Well, right. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6719.0s)]
*  I mean, I I think thankfully left that behind, you know, some time ago. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6720.0s)]
*  But but yeah, it was just really it used to be really uncomfortable for me to go do local sets in L.A. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6725.0s)]
*  Because Steve-O doing stand up, you know, a lot of people look kind of sideways at that. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6732.0s)]
*  And then there's the the fact that that the people aren't there to see me. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6738.0s)]
*  They're there. You know, it's like, you know, which is actually a benefit. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6744.0s)]
*  But and then there's the the level that in the crowd are going to be like people who are like, you know, agents, you know, industry professionals. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6749.0s)]
*  Like it just felt like a lot of pressure. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6759.0s)]
*  And it used to scare the shit out of me. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6761.0s)]
*  It should. Yeah. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6763.0s)]
*  But, you know, you're in the big leagues. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6764.0s)]
*  You're doing stand up at the Comedy Store. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6766.0s)]
*  You're in the fucking big leagues. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6767.0s)]
*  You're at the improv. That's the big leagues. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6768.0s)]
*  But that's also how you get better. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6770.0s)]
*  You know, you gotta be you gotta be scared. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6772.0s)]
*  You can't just be the fucking hero every time you go. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6773.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6775.0s)]
*  And like I said, when I took the when I took that eight months off to put together the bucket list, it was all the Comedy Store. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6776.0s)]
*  It was all the improv, the Laugh Factory. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6784.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6787.0s)]
*  And the key is also doing different places, too, right? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6788.0s)]
*  Like going to the ice house, going to the ha ha, going to these different places, get a different feel, these different neighborhoods, these different clubs you're working at. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6791.0s)]
*  There's a lot going on, man, when you're piecing together material. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6800.0s)]
*  But, you know, I think it's it's unfortunate that you had to like, oh, Steve, I was doing comedy like I don't get that at all. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6804.0s)]
*  Even actors like actors go up. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6813.0s)]
*  I give him a chance. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6815.0s)]
*  Like if you really want to do it like good luck. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6816.0s)]
*  I hope you do well. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6819.0s)]
*  I would love to see some person who's an actor. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6821.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden there's there are killer stand up comic. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6823.0s)]
*  Look, that's fucking Neil Brennan, who's a great stand up comic, was a producer of The Chappelle Show. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6826.0s)]
*  He was the co-creator. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6832.0s)]
*  Didn't do stand up when I met Neil. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6833.0s)]
*  Neil was a doorman at Boston Comedy, the club in New York City in the village. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6835.0s)]
*  And I knew him from then. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6840.0s)]
*  And then when he started doing stand up, I'm like, good for you. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6841.0s)]
*  That's fucking awesome. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6844.0s)]
*  And so many people were hating on him even back then. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6845.0s)]
*  They just people are weird, man. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6848.0s)]
*  They just get scared and they don't want you to do the thing that they do. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6851.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6855.0s)]
*  I think a lot of it, too, was just me putting that on myself. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6856.0s)]
*  Me just assuming that people are looking at me that way. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6859.0s)]
*  Oh, they definitely were looking at you like that. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6862.0s)]
*  It's not putting on yourself. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6863.0s)]
*  It's just I'm saying those people who are doing it were cunts. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6865.0s)]
*  Right, right, right, right. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6868.0s)]
*  It's insecurity. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6870.0s)]
*  It's all it is. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6871.0s)]
*  Like if someone's a fucking housewife and they're 45 years old, they just decide to go on stage for the first time. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6872.0s)]
*  I'm rooting for them. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6879.0s)]
*  I want them to do well. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6880.0s)]
*  I want everybody to do well. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6881.0s)]
*  It's a possibility. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6883.0s)]
*  You can do well. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6884.0s)]
*  And the more people that do like if I watch some woman who's 35 years old or 45 years old, has never done stand up ever, and she goes up and kills, that's exciting to me. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6885.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, she's got talent. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6894.0s)]
*  Probably maybe made her friends laugh and thought she could do it and spent the time or wrote some stuff out. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6896.0s)]
*  That's great. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6901.0s)]
*  It's great for the art form. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6902.0s)]
*  It's great for everybody. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6903.0s)]
*  Your boy Curtis from the Comedy Store last night was saying that in Texas, that's like the sensibility of the crowd, like more so than anywhere else, that they really are rooting for the comic to have success on stage. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6905.0s)]
*  Well, we have a really good environment here, you know, and it's essentially there was always a kind of there was a scene, a small scene. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6919.0s)]
*  But now, like 12 world class comics have moved here during the pandemic. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6926.0s)]
*  So it's fucking amazing. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6931.0s)]
*  Like the show tonight. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6932.0s)]
*  It's Duncan Trussell and Tony Hinchcliffe, William Montgomery and fucking great. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6933.0s)]
*  I love Duncan Trussell so much. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6940.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6943.0s)]
*  I love him to death. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6944.0s)]
*  Like of my podcasts that I've recorded, my two favorite ones are Duncan Trussell and Kevin Smith. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6945.0s)]
*  Oh, well, two great, great people to talk to. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6952.0s)]
*  But yeah, interesting people. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6955.0s)]
*  Just getting into like weird, like spiritual, fucking like philosophical. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6956.0s)]
*  What's the universe about? [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6963.0s)]
*  Like those conversations were so fucking great, man. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6965.0s)]
*  Well, Duncan, he brings out a special quality in people, too. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6968.0s)]
*  There's something about his inquisitiveness and his mind that excites a part of your mind makes you think that way. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6971.0s)]
*  Dude, when I was talking to Duncan Trussell on my podcast, I told him we were talking about consciousness. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6978.0s)]
*  I said, I have a theory that people are making a mistake in assuming that the human brain is a generator of consciousness, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6986.0s)]
*  that that's where the word consciousness originates. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=6999.0s)]
*  You know, so the like the that it's a transmitter. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7004.0s)]
*  And I said, I believe that the brain is a receiver of consciousness. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7009.0s)]
*  So like, say, for example, if you've got a radio, you know, you can fucking take a sledgehammer. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7017.0s)]
*  You can smash that that that radio to oblivion. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7024.0s)]
*  You've killed the radio, but you've done nothing to kill the signal. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7027.0s)]
*  Right. Like the signal is still is still out there. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7031.0s)]
*  We're just a radio picking up a signal, you know, and that's kind of how I look at it. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7035.0s)]
*  And Duncan Trussell, without skipping a beat, he goes, Yep. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7040.0s)]
*  And there's some people walking around thinking, I'm the fucking Beatles. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7043.0s)]
*  Well, it's an interesting theory. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7052.0s)]
*  It might be all those things. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7055.0s)]
*  It might be all those things. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7057.0s)]
*  It might be you are conscious and consciousness does emanate in you. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7059.0s)]
*  And the whole universe is conscious as well. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7063.0s)]
*  Right. It might be your consciousness communicates with all of consciousness. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7065.0s)]
*  It might be, you know, we're limited in that term. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7072.0s)]
*  Like, what is that term? It means you're aware. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7075.0s)]
*  It means you're a lot. So is my dog. Right. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7077.0s)]
*  I talk to him. He's obviously conscious. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7079.0s)]
*  You know, he knows what I'm saying. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7081.0s)]
*  You know, he knows I love him. Yeah. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7083.0s)]
*  It's like he's conscious. I see him in the morning. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7085.0s)]
*  We have this thing we do in the morning. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7088.0s)]
*  I always go up to my good morning, sir. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7090.0s)]
*  My wife is funny because she like she doesn't like when he whines. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7092.0s)]
*  But I think it's awesome. It's hilarious because he wants he's so happy. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7095.0s)]
*  He always has to get a toy. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7098.0s)]
*  Whenever I like he's so funny, like whenever he gets pet, he wants to go get a toy first because he's a retriever. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7100.0s)]
*  So he goes and gets a toy and he brings it over. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7105.0s)]
*  And then he wants to have the toy in his mouth while he's getting pet. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7107.0s)]
*  And he's saying, oh, oh, oh, oh. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7110.0s)]
*  And so we do this now. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7112.0s)]
*  Good morning. I give him all this love and he gets so fucking happy. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7116.0s)]
*  It's so obvious he's conscious. So what is that consciousness? [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7119.0s)]
*  Like, what is that? Is he getting it from the universe? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7123.0s)]
*  It's obviously in him, too. Right. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7125.0s)]
*  It's you are conscious and consciousness exists. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7127.0s)]
*  There's something that exists outside of us. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7131.0s)]
*  And I think that's where you pull ideas from. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7134.0s)]
*  They come from the ether, but they also come from your mind. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7137.0s)]
*  They come from, you know, states of consciousness, whether it's psychedelics or meditation or yoga or there's there's different ways you feel different times, depending on how life is going. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7140.0s)]
*  And all that is a factor. It is something is in you. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7152.0s)]
*  But what is that? And how much of that is innate to you? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7157.0s)]
*  And how much of that is just in the universe itself? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7162.0s)]
*  It's a massive mystery. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7165.0s)]
*  And I think to isolate it to your own individual mind and to live and dwell inside your own ego and consciousness, I think it's a bit of a trap. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7167.0s)]
*  You know, and even to just say it's not you, it's everything. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7178.0s)]
*  It's you're an antenna like maybe, maybe you're an antenna. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7182.0s)]
*  Maybe. I mean, I mean, it's kind of like it's a very limiting to define it in a way because we experience it. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7185.0s)]
*  But to try to box it in is almost to try to understand this thing that's unknowable. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7193.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7197.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a weird thing to be a person and thinking. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7199.0s)]
*  And there's so and also to be a person that has thousands of years of human instincts that were ingrained in us through genes and evolution for survival and for social interaction. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7202.0s)]
*  And in order to be able to keep the species moving, like there's all these things that are in us that maybe aren't even very self-serving. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7215.0s)]
*  And you have to kind of navigate those and figure out the best way that you can manage them personally. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7223.0s)]
*  And some people are terrible at it. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7229.0s)]
*  And some people, they push it on everyone else and they fuck everybody else's life around them in order for them to have some sort of sense of control. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7231.0s)]
*  They keep everybody on edge and everybody's upset. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7238.0s)]
*  And then and then they get this high out of like like having disputes with people and then making up, you know, like there's a lot of people out there. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7241.0s)]
*  They have these like these little bitter battles with people and they really just want love. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7250.0s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7255.0s)]
*  But they don't know how to get love in any way other than like being shitty to people and controlling and then apologizing and then, you know, and then making up. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7257.0s)]
*  It's like those roller coaster type relationships that some people get trapped in. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7267.0s)]
*  Yeah, those super highs and super lows and fuck you. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7272.0s)]
*  I fucking hate you. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7275.0s)]
*  And then you're fucking and having the best time ever. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7276.0s)]
*  It's like nuts. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7278.0s)]
*  But it's just it's this management of this thing we call consciousness. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7280.0s)]
*  And there's, you know, there's not a lot of fucking really good guidebooks on how to do it and not specifically to you either. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7285.0s)]
*  We're all this very complex individual machine that has all these stored emotions and life experiences and and genes and family and loved ones. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7293.0s)]
*  And there's no fucking guidebook for your individual journey. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7304.0s)]
*  And you can kind of like pull abstract thoughts from Alan Watts and Terrence McKenna and all these different people that kind of give you like a framework to think about individual experience. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7308.0s)]
*  Yeah, Jordan Peterson is great. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7321.0s)]
*  Yeah, Jordan Peterson is great for that, too. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7322.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking bad ass. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7324.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7325.0s)]
*  And but then also you see flaws in each of these individual people that are giving you great advice. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7326.0s)]
*  Well, and then you see them fuck their life up and like, wow, everybody is really on their own little strange journey trying to navigate this. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7331.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7340.0s)]
*  Like Jordan, particularly was on Benzos, right, which is anti anxiety medication. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7341.0s)]
*  Xanax. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7346.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he got fucking horribly addicted to it and destroyed his life for a few years. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7347.0s)]
*  Like, and getting off it was horrendous. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7352.0s)]
*  When was that? [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7354.0s)]
*  Recently. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7355.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7356.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he just recently coming out of the fog of it all, you know, and he was he was on those things for quite a while. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7357.0s)]
*  And it really fucked him up, like to the point where he didn't know if he was going to make it. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7364.0s)]
*  Benzos are one of those things where them and alcohol, if you quit cold turkey, you'll die. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7368.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7374.0s)]
*  I mean, even heroin, you can survive quitting cold turkey as addictive as that is. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7375.0s)]
*  People survived that. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7381.0s)]
*  But Benzos apparently are a fucking nightmare, horrible nightmare. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7383.0s)]
*  Try to get over. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7387.0s)]
*  I love those things, man. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7389.0s)]
*  I bet I'm scared of those. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7391.0s)]
*  I don't even want to know what that feels like. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7393.0s)]
*  Those and coke. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7394.0s)]
*  I'm like, you can keep it. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7395.0s)]
*  I don't want to know. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7396.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7397.0s)]
*  I don't want to know. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7398.0s)]
*  We were talking about the deviated septum and it's weird that for you, a deviated septum meant one thing. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7400.0s)]
*  But like for me, deviated septum means I've got like the whole that's a perforated septum. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7410.0s)]
*  I prefer there you go. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7415.0s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7417.0s)]
*  I think that's different. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7418.0s)]
*  That's correct. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7419.0s)]
*  I think that's when people rot out the inside of their nose and blow. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7420.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did that. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7423.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7424.0s)]
*  I think Artie Lang did that, too. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7425.0s)]
*  When I was in rehab, Knoxville came and visited me and we took the shoelace out of Knoxville's Chuck Taylor and I put it up one nostril through the fucking hole and just straight threaded my nose. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7427.0s)]
*  How big was that hole? [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7447.0s)]
*  Enough to get the shoelace through. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7450.0s)]
*  Did you get it fixed? [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7452.0s)]
*  No, no. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7453.0s)]
*  Did they like sew it up or is there still a hole in there? [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7454.0s)]
*  Still a hole in there. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7455.0s)]
*  So you can do that shoelace trick right now? [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7456.0s)]
*  I've tried it, but yeah, I could do it, man. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7458.0s)]
*  Should we try it? [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7462.0s)]
*  No, you don't need to do that. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7463.0s)]
*  What is that? [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7465.0s)]
*  I'm shining a light. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7466.0s)]
*  Oh, so the flashlight goes through one hole. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7467.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7469.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7470.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7471.0s)]
*  So that hole is you could put the flashlight in one nostril and it shines through to the other. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7472.0s)]
*  Holy shit, man. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7477.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7478.0s)]
*  Bring up the shoelace. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7479.0s)]
*  I'm sure that's on there. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7483.0s)]
*  Yuck. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7485.0s)]
*  Yuck. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7486.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7487.0s)]
*  Well, it's, you know, getting punched in this thing, it's like, God, this thing's so delicate. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7488.0s)]
*  Your nose is such a delicate little instrument. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7493.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7495.0s)]
*  Dude, the fucking, like on my second hour, I had a... [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7496.0s)]
*  There it is. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7502.0s)]
*  That's actually in the... [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7503.0s)]
*  You're putting it through. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7504.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7505.0s)]
*  Through the hole. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7508.0s)]
*  So the Coke just burned a hole through the center of your nostril. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7509.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7514.0s)]
*  Oh God, that's so awful. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7515.0s)]
*  That's Knoxville filming. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7517.0s)]
*  So that was before I had ever... [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7521.0s)]
*  Ah. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7524.0s)]
*  That was before I had ever broken my nose, right? [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7525.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7528.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7529.0s)]
*  All the shit you did, you never broke your nose? [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7530.0s)]
*  I never... [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7533.0s)]
*  The first time I broke my nose was when we were filming Jackass 3D, right? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7535.0s)]
*  And in that movie, like Bam had this trick. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7542.0s)]
*  He'd sneak up behind you, and with one hand he would throw a cup of water in your face, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7546.0s)]
*  and with the other hand he would like punch you with that. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7551.0s)]
*  What a great trick. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7556.0s)]
*  It was called the Rocky. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7559.0s)]
*  He's a regular David Blaine. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7560.0s)]
*  It was called the Rocky, and the purpose of it was to... [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7563.0s)]
*  Punch you. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7567.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7568.0s)]
*  Well, it was to take advantage of what at the time was super new technology with the [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7569.0s)]
*  Phantom camera, shooting like 1,500 frames per second. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7575.0s)]
*  Oh. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7579.0s)]
*  It was like... [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7580.0s)]
*  We were like, I think, the first movie to really, really take advantage of that. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7581.0s)]
*  So you would see in that super slow motion the water, and you'd see the face jiggling. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7586.0s)]
*  It was pretty rad. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7591.0s)]
*  They actually played the Rocky music. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7593.0s)]
*  Well, so Bam... [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7596.0s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7599.0s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't even look like that big of a deal now, but... [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7607.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7610.0s)]
*  That looks like brain damage. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7611.0s)]
*  That looks terrible. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7613.0s)]
*  That looks like someone could get knocked unconscious. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7614.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's such a cheap shot. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7617.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7620.0s)]
*  It's just straight sucker punching. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7621.0s)]
*  It's totally sucker punching. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7623.0s)]
*  Jesus, you guys did some ridiculous shit to each other. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7625.0s)]
*  Right, and so when Bam did that to me, he broke my nose. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7628.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7633.0s)]
*  Shocker. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7634.0s)]
*  And I was like... [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7635.0s)]
*  I didn't do anything about it for like two months, and I was just kind of like stewing [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7637.0s)]
*  about it. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7642.0s)]
*  And then finally, I didn't like the way it looked, and I was like, you know what? [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7643.0s)]
*  I'm going to go get my fucking nose fixed, and I'm going to make the fucking movie pay [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7647.0s)]
*  for it. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7650.0s)]
*  So I go to this fancy Beverly Hills nose doctor, and he says, yeah, I could fix it, but it's [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7651.0s)]
*  been two months. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7659.0s)]
*  It's healed this way. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7660.0s)]
*  So now, at this point... [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7661.0s)]
*  You have to re-break it. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7664.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, you were twisted. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7665.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7666.0s)]
*  Yeah, so now we've got to re-break it. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7667.0s)]
*  And I heard that, and I'm like, oh, no big deal. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7671.0s)]
*  I'll live with it. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7674.0s)]
*  Then I go to the fucking Charlie Sheen roast. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7675.0s)]
*  I talked Mike Tyson into holding out his fist, just letting me run into it. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7679.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7684.0s)]
*  I was trying to get myself a black eye, and what happened was I just landed with my nose [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7685.0s)]
*  on Mike Tyson's fist, and fucking super broke it. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7690.0s)]
*  And then, that was the last thing that happened on stage at the Charlie Sheen roast. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7695.0s)]
*  So now everybody's like, I'm like just mangled. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7700.0s)]
*  My fucking nose was so broken. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7704.0s)]
*  But the show's over. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7706.0s)]
*  This guy comes up... [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7707.0s)]
*  So you threw yourself in his fist. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7708.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, I don't. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7711.0s)]
*  I don't. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7712.0s)]
*  Oh my god, dude. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7713.0s)]
*  That's horrific. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7714.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then this guy comes out of the audience. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7715.0s)]
*  He comes up to me and he says, dude, Steve-O, your nose needs to be set right now. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7717.0s)]
*  And that made perfect sense to me because of what the doctor had told me. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7721.0s)]
*  So the guy says, I'm a kung fu instructor. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7727.0s)]
*  I got you. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7732.0s)]
*  And I'm thinking, well, that doesn't sound great, but he's not going to make it look [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7734.0s)]
*  any worse. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7744.0s)]
*  I've got very little to lose in this situation. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7745.0s)]
*  So I sit down on the stage and he just fucking wrenches my nose into position. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7747.0s)]
*  And go back to that before and after. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7753.0s)]
*  And he fixed it? [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7755.0s)]
*  So that's how he fixed it? [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7756.0s)]
*  Oh, so you didn't go to a doctor? [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7757.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got a Mike Tyson nose job, dude. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7758.0s)]
*  It looks great. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7761.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7765.0s)]
*  It looks great. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7766.0s)]
*  Do you go back to where I started before that? [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7767.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was definitely twisted to the side. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7769.0s)]
*  So once he snapped it, then you pushed it back into place. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7771.0s)]
*  There's a video of Josh Barnett doing that to someone. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7775.0s)]
*  The guy got his nose broken in training and Josh Barnett sticks a pencil up his nose and [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7778.0s)]
*  corrects it and pushes it to the side. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7784.0s)]
*  It doesn't feel good. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7786.0s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7787.0s)]
*  This dude's in agony. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7788.0s)]
*  And you know, Josh is not the most sensitive to someone in pain. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7789.0s)]
*  So is a pen. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7795.0s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7796.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7797.0s)]
*  That's really clever, though. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7798.0s)]
*  Well, he knows how to do it. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7800.0s)]
*  I mean, Josh has been around combat sports his whole life. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7801.0s)]
*  This side's closed up. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7804.0s)]
*  The other side's not so bad. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7805.0s)]
*  So he's shoving it in there. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7806.0s)]
*  And he just, that guy's got to be in agony right there. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7811.0s)]
*  I remember that. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7817.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7818.0s)]
*  Dr. Josh. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7820.0s)]
*  Yeah, so he fixed it with two pens. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7822.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7825.0s)]
*  Try not to f*** with it. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7826.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7828.0s)]
*  Well, because it's going to itch, it's going to swell, it's going to a lot of things. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7829.0s)]
*  And you're going to want to mess with it and it's going to knock it out. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7833.0s)]
*  See, it's straight right now. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7837.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7838.0s)]
*  For the most part. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7839.0s)]
*  It's pretty swollen, though. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7840.0s)]
*  Is there ice next door, Josh? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7841.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7843.0s)]
*  Everybody needs to have a friend like that. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7844.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7846.0s)]
*  Well, if you're going to have someone do it, have someone like Josh who really knows the [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7847.0s)]
*  f*** he's doing. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7850.0s)]
*  He's probably done that to many people. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7851.0s)]
*  Evidently, my homie knew what was up. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7853.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7856.0s)]
*  What? [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7857.0s)]
*  He killed it. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7858.0s)]
*  Fixed it. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7859.0s)]
*  And you can breathe out of your nose, no problem. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7860.0s)]
*  Pretty good. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7863.0s)]
*  What happens is, because I've got the perforation, like I'll wake up in the morning a lot of [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7864.0s)]
*  the time and I've got just this booger cork. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7870.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7874.0s)]
*  And I'll like, you know. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7875.0s)]
*  Is it to push and try to blow it out? [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7877.0s)]
*  I can blow it out, but I'll blow out and it'll look like an hourglass sometimes, like, because [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7880.0s)]
*  it's just a straight cork. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7885.0s)]
*  It's funny. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7888.0s)]
*  After I got my nose fixed, I would for like weeks have these horrendous bloody boogers. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7890.0s)]
*  I mean, they were giant, like the size of a thumb. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7900.0s)]
*  I would blow them out. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7903.0s)]
*  I remember I showed it to Tom Segura. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7904.0s)]
*  I blew it. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7906.0s)]
*  I go, look at that. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7907.0s)]
*  He would, he almost threw up just looking at it. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7908.0s)]
*  These things were giant. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7910.0s)]
*  I think I documented it on my Instagram. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7912.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7914.0s)]
*  I think I've got these giant bloody boogers. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7915.0s)]
*  No, it was a long time ago. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7917.0s)]
*  Might not have even been Instagram because this is like more than 10 years ago. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7918.0s)]
*  Like when did Instagram start? [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7923.0s)]
*  I got it in 2012. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7925.0s)]
*  So I got my nose fixed in 2000 and it's 2022. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7927.0s)]
*  I think I probably got it fixed 15 years ago. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7934.0s)]
*  Does a nine sound right? [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7938.0s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds about right. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7941.0s)]
*  It sounds about right. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7943.0s)]
*  Does this 14 years ago? [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7944.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a twit pic. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7946.0s)]
*  Oh, never mind. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7947.0s)]
*  There it is. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7948.0s)]
*  You found it? [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7949.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7950.0s)]
*  So it wasn't, it was before Instagram, right? [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7951.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7952.0s)]
*  So here's the tweet. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7953.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7954.0s)]
*  And then I think someone found the picture. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7955.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7956.0s)]
*  Look at the size of that thing. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7957.0s)]
*  Look at the size of that fucking thing. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7958.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7961.0s)]
*  And that was a small one. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7962.0s)]
*  I had blown some giant ones out that I didn't document right after I first got it done because [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7963.0s)]
*  it was just like the boogers were just like, I don't know. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7969.0s)]
*  I don't know why it was like so susceptible to boogers. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7971.0s)]
*  Like my nose is probably freaked out. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7974.0s)]
*  Like what did you do? [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7975.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7976.0s)]
*  And there was like a, they had to put plastic splints up in there. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7977.0s)]
*  So they stitched a plastic splint into place and they shoved these tubes, these foam tubes [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7980.0s)]
*  and the foam tubes had like little tubes at the end to drain shit out of it. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7987.0s)]
*  And I had to have like a gauze mustache that I wore around for the first day or so after [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7993.0s)]
*  the operation. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=7999.0s)]
*  But I highly recommend it to people that, there it is. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8001.0s)]
*  See? [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8004.0s)]
*  So there's like foam things with these holes. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8005.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8007.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8008.0s)]
*  But man, they fixed it. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8009.0s)]
*  That's good, man. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8011.0s)]
*  It's like if you can't breathe out of your nose, there's so many fighters that I talk [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8012.0s)]
*  to. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8015.0s)]
*  And when you talk to them, they talk like this. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8016.0s)]
*  Like you could tell as they're talking that there's no, you know, it sounds like they [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8017.0s)]
*  have a stuffy nose because their nose is useless. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8022.0s)]
*  Like Justin Gagey, when you listen to Justin talk, like for sure his nose is fucked. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8024.0s)]
*  There's no way that guy's breathing out of that nose at all. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8029.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8031.0s)]
*  Like play a clip of Justin Gagey talking. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8032.0s)]
*  Try to find a clip. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8035.0s)]
*  When you hear, you can hear in his voice the nasal sound. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8036.0s)]
*  It's super common. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8041.0s)]
*  Like I hear it in D.C. sometimes when we do commentary together. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8042.0s)]
*  Like I'm sure his nose is fucked. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8045.0s)]
*  Oh, he had surgery recently? [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8047.0s)]
*  Oh, good for him. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8049.0s)]
*  I think I've heard about that. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8051.0s)]
*  So how's life been without a fight books for you so far? [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8052.0s)]
*  You know, there's a really fast and then really slow. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8055.0s)]
*  I really enjoy both parts of this game. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8058.0s)]
*  I got my nose fixed about five weeks ago. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8062.0s)]
*  OK, so he's still swollen. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8064.0s)]
*  So, you know, anticipating my food is something I've been really enjoying. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8066.0s)]
*  Well, given that I'm sure you haven't been in camp or anything or training given you fixed your nose. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8071.0s)]
*  Have you had time to let the rest of your body heal up too from just constantly being in camp over the last? [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8076.0s)]
*  Yeah. So that's a nose surgery that he waited for years. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8081.0s)]
*  If you find videos before that, like it sounded a little stuffy there. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8083.0s)]
*  But if you listen to it before that, it was like probably completely closed off. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8087.0s)]
*  But you know, Justin has that wild style of fighting where he gets hit. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8091.0s)]
*  He'll put people into the fire. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8095.0s)]
*  He'll like grab people and jump into a volcano with them. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8097.0s)]
*  Like that's yeah. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8101.0s)]
*  See, that's how I had to have that bandage thing. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8102.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8104.0s)]
*  Bandage mustache. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8105.0s)]
*  I love Justin Gage. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8106.0s)]
*  He's great. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8107.0s)]
*  He's also got no ACL. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8108.0s)]
*  One of his knees has no ACL. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8110.0s)]
*  I don't know if he bothered getting that fixed or he's going to wait until after he's done fighting. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8112.0s)]
*  But yeah, he blew his ACL out and decided to just keep fighting with no ACL. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8116.0s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8120.0s)]
*  But that fucking the world that those guys live in is just a different world. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8122.0s)]
*  Like the world of what kind of pain you can tolerate and what kind of discomfort you can tolerate. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8128.0s)]
*  That's a different world. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8133.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8135.0s)]
*  Wild fucking humans. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8136.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8137.0s)]
*  May I want to tell you about my Tesla? [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8139.0s)]
*  Well, I saw the video. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8143.0s)]
*  So send Jamie the video so we can play it. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8145.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8148.0s)]
*  If you get AirDrop it to Jamie. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8149.0s)]
*  This is that. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8150.0s)]
*  It did so much fun. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8153.0s)]
*  So I ordered a Tesla. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8155.0s)]
*  You got to wait for it for quite some time. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8157.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8162.0s)]
*  This is the first thing I did with a drive to Vegas. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8163.0s)]
*  And I find a crane operator who's willing to hoist up my Tesla over 100 feet in the air so that I can sleep in it overnight. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8167.0s)]
*  So you slept in it up there? [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8177.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8179.0s)]
*  Why? [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8180.0s)]
*  Just because. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8181.0s)]
*  Why? [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8182.0s)]
*  I thought it. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8183.0s)]
*  Why, Steve? [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8184.0s)]
*  Why? [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8185.0s)]
*  And here's the craziest part is I didn't have a location. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8186.0s)]
*  I go over to the UFC and I'm hanging out with Dana. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8190.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, damn, what do you think if I do this here? [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8193.0s)]
*  And Dana's like, yeah, let's do it. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8197.0s)]
*  Who else would let you do that? [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8201.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8202.0s)]
*  Because if you open up the door, we're sleepwalking and fell out to your death. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8203.0s)]
*  I mean, the fucking, the, to do that, like, to permit that would take weeks. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8206.0s)]
*  Permits and insurance. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8218.0s)]
*  And like that happened within like 24 fucking hours because Dana said it's cool. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8219.0s)]
*  That's so ridiculous. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8224.0s)]
*  Send Jamie the video. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8227.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8228.0s)]
*  And so then I left for my Canada tour, like, you know, a couple days after that. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8229.0s)]
*  And literally the fucking day after I get home, I've got my buddies have built a ramp over my Tesla. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8235.0s)]
*  Just like mounted a crazy ramp and a track over the whole fucking roof is made out of glass. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8246.0s)]
*  Like the windshield goes from the hood all the way to the truck. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8252.0s)]
*  I'm just it's like skating over glass. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8257.0s)]
*  And I got Tony Hawk driving my Tesla and I fucking jump my skateboard onto it and skate over the whole thing while it's moving. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8260.0s)]
*  With leopard tights on. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8268.0s)]
*  Pretty ridiculous. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8276.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8277.0s)]
*  And I just like I'm so dying for Elon to see that. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8278.0s)]
*  Well, I'll make sure he sees it. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8284.0s)]
*  Dude, I love it. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8286.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8287.0s)]
*  He's a little busy right now. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8288.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't doubt it. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8289.0s)]
*  I don't understand why. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8290.0s)]
*  I mean, the fucking the fact that that guy can do Twitter while he's doing SpaceX and running time. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8291.0s)]
*  I mean, how? [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8298.0s)]
*  How? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8299.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8300.0s)]
*  Weird. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8301.0s)]
*  I read some articles. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8302.0s)]
*  I saw I didn't read the article. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8303.0s)]
*  I read the headline. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8304.0s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8305.0s)]
*  I have too much on my plate right now. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8306.0s)]
*  Like, duh. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8307.0s)]
*  You think? [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8308.0s)]
*  Fucking duh. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8309.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, it's it's it's a mark. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8310.0s)]
*  But, dude, how about that? [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8315.0s)]
*  Are you still driving a Tesla? [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8316.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8318.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8324.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8325.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8326.0s)]
*  The ludicrous mode. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8327.0s)]
*  It's ludicrous all the time. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8328.0s)]
*  I never take it off. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8329.0s)]
*  Well, I had the regular Model S. I never took it off a ludicrous. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8330.0s)]
*  And this one, I don't even know if it has a mode. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8331.0s)]
*  I think you just drive it that way. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8333.0s)]
*  I mean, I never even checked. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8335.0s)]
*  It's so fast. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8337.0s)]
*  The idea that you would make it faster. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8338.0s)]
*  It's I don't think I don't even I don't even I honestly don't know what I don't like about [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8341.0s)]
*  the Tesla is that everything is on the screen now. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8346.0s)]
*  Like you want to adjust the mirrors. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8349.0s)]
*  You want to change the temperature. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8350.0s)]
*  I like physical knobs and stuff and buttons, stuff that you could see easily while you're [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8352.0s)]
*  driving. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8358.0s)]
*  There's a little bit of that that annoys me that there's so much of the stuff that's on [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8359.0s)]
*  the screen. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8363.0s)]
*  Wow, dude. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8364.0s)]
*  What's up with that? [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8365.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's no buttons. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8366.0s)]
*  That's my car. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8368.0s)]
*  That's the same kind of car that I have. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8369.0s)]
*  That's not my personal car. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8371.0s)]
*  But it's amazing car, though. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8372.0s)]
*  It's fucking incredible. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8374.0s)]
*  The way it drives is just amazing. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8375.0s)]
*  I just would prefer tangible. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8378.0s)]
*  I don't like the fact that the horn is not the center of the steering wheel either. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8380.0s)]
*  It's a button on the steering wheel, which I think sucks. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8384.0s)]
*  And I don't like the fact that they took away the blinker stock. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8387.0s)]
*  And instead now you have to press the buttons on the steering wheel for left and right. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8390.0s)]
*  I've kind of gotten used to that. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8397.0s)]
*  But the horn thing is annoying because it's like that. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8399.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8403.0s)]
*  But you can do a lot of the stuff with voice. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8404.0s)]
*  You could say, you know, lower the temperature beyond ludicrous. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8406.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8410.0s)]
*  What is it beyond ludicrous? [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8411.0s)]
*  It's beyond ludicrous. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8414.0s)]
*  Oh, I think they're just saying that it's so fast. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8417.0s)]
*  It's beyond ludicrous mode in the regular Model S. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8420.0s)]
*  It's a thousand horsepower, a thousand twenty real horsepower. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8424.0s)]
*  That's peak power. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8429.0s)]
*  That's real. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8430.0s)]
*  It's so fast. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8431.0s)]
*  I have a lot of fast cars. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8433.0s)]
*  That is without a doubt the fastest car I have. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8434.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8436.0s)]
*  And it's so silent that when you hit the gas and you take off, it's like. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8437.0s)]
*  It doesn't even feel real. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8443.0s)]
*  It just it feels like you're time traveling. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8445.0s)]
*  Like you're just like you punch a hole through space time to move to a place quicker because you have this sense of what a car is capable of doing. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8447.0s)]
*  And then you get in that thing and just goes. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8454.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8456.0s)]
*  You feel like you're on a fucking roller coaster. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8457.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8459.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8460.0s)]
*  Literally like it slams people to the backseat. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8461.0s)]
*  I took Tim Dillon in my old one, which is not as fast as this new one. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8463.0s)]
*  I want to feel something crazy. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8466.0s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I'm just on the gas like Jesus. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8467.0s)]
*  You can't believe it because you have a sense of like what a fast car feels like. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8471.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8475.0s)]
*  And you get in that thing, which it's really good for merging on the highway. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8476.0s)]
*  If you want to merge on the highway and you got an opening, you look. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8479.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8481.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden you're going 70 miles an hour like that. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8482.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8484.0s)]
*  Like have you ever thought about like when you're approaching a light and it's like it's yellow, you know you can make it, you know, because you've got the Tesla. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8485.0s)]
*  But what if the person on the other side of the light also has a Tesla and you're both punching it? [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8496.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8502.0s)]
*  You know, you got to be aware. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8503.0s)]
*  Well, you got to be aware whenever you're in a fucking intersection. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8505.0s)]
*  I saw some dude the other day just blow through a red light, just wasn't even paying attention. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8508.0s)]
*  I see these cars just slam on their brakes. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8513.0s)]
*  This dude just whether he's on his phone or what he is blue through a red light. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8515.0s)]
*  Is it just got to be statistics like since cell phones became like a real thing that like car accidents have they just spiked because people are fucking around with their phone? [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8520.0s)]
*  It must. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8531.0s)]
*  There's a lot of deaths that are related to people being distracted by electronics, whether you're fucking with your navigation screen or you're fucking with your right on your music on your your screen or whether you're actually looking physically at a phone physically at a phone and texting is probably the worst because you're moving your thumb around. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8532.0s)]
*  There's no way you can concentrate. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8549.0s)]
*  Is that is there data on that? [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8551.0s)]
*  I mean, it's got to be off the charts. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8553.0s)]
*  It's got to be off the charts. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8555.0s)]
*  The amount of people that die from distracted driving. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8557.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8560.0s)]
*  It's got to be crazy. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8561.0s)]
*  Yeah, like way more than aspirin. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8562.0s)]
*  It's not the death. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8565.0s)]
*  So I just definitely went up, but it then goes down to around the time. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8566.0s)]
*  It's 2010, which is when iPhones came out. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8572.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8575.0s)]
*  Not what I thought I would see. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8576.0s)]
*  That's weird. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8577.0s)]
*  Maybe it's just cars get better. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8578.0s)]
*  Could be that too. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8580.0s)]
*  A lot of things are going to have to go into account on this. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8581.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8583.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8584.0s)]
*  Number of deaths per population of 100,000 people. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8585.0s)]
*  Back up now. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8587.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8588.0s)]
*  Well, it's social media, distracted driving, all that. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8589.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8593.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8594.0s)]
*  Not good. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8595.0s)]
*  And then there's also like how many people are suffering from depression and anxiety because of phones because they're addicted to social media and they're just constantly comparing themselves to other people. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8596.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8607.0s)]
*  And reading comments about how bad they suck. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8608.0s)]
*  Comments are rough, man. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8611.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8612.0s)]
*  I think no matter who you are. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8613.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8614.0s)]
*  I got to be a little bit careful about like spending time reading comments, man. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8615.0s)]
*  I don't read shit. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8621.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8622.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8623.0s)]
*  I don't think it's good for you to even read the good stuff. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8624.0s)]
*  I concur. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8625.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8627.0s)]
*  I think you could get lost in other people's opinions and just kind of forget who you are and not be sure who you are. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8628.0s)]
*  I mean, dude, I feel like I had an experience going through an airport where like one person comes up to me and they're like, dude, I fucking watch everything. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8636.0s)]
*  I fucking love it, man. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8654.0s)]
*  And like, you know, and then like I'll go to, you know, walk a little further. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8656.0s)]
*  And now I'm at the security checkpoint. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8661.0s)]
*  And then the guy's like, hey, man, what happened to you? [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8664.0s)]
*  I haven't seen you in anything forever. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8667.0s)]
*  You know, and it's like, like, it's such jarring. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8669.0s)]
*  That's regular real life interaction. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8674.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8677.0s)]
*  Like regular real life shit. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8678.0s)]
*  Well, some people just try to make you feel bad. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8679.0s)]
*  Oh, you ain't doing shit. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8681.0s)]
*  I remember I was at a fucking CVS once. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8683.0s)]
*  I'll never forget this CVS in Woodland Hills. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8686.0s)]
*  And I go into this thing and there's this guy behind the corner. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8689.0s)]
*  He's like real shitty. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8693.0s)]
*  And he goes, you used to be on TV, huh? [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8694.0s)]
*  Used to be on Fear Factor. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8698.0s)]
*  What happened? [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8699.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8700.0s)]
*  I'm like, what happened? [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8701.0s)]
*  I got canceled. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8702.0s)]
*  He's got canceled. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8703.0s)]
*  Huh? [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8705.0s)]
*  I go, hey, man, you're working at CVS. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8706.0s)]
*  The fuck are you doing? [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8707.0s)]
*  Like, are you trying to make me feel bad? [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8709.0s)]
*  You're behind the counter at CVS. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8711.0s)]
*  You think you're going to make me feel bad? [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8713.0s)]
*  Like, I'm like, I'm not going to tell you my resume and all the things I'm doing now. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8715.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8719.0s)]
*  But this is a weird interaction. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8720.0s)]
*  Like you, sir, lack self-awareness. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8722.0s)]
*  You're literally working a minimum wage job and you're getting shitty with me because I used to be on Fear Factor. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8725.0s)]
*  And you're trying to, it was like really clear. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8731.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8733.0s)]
*  He had some foreign accent, but he was like, like fucking with me. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8734.0s)]
*  Like, what happened? [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8737.0s)]
*  What happened to your show? [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8738.0s)]
*  I was like, what did I do to you, man? [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8739.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8741.0s)]
*  And also, I don't want to say, hey, you fucking loser, you're working at CVS. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8743.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8747.0s)]
*  You know, you're 50 years old and you're working at CVS and you're trying to make me feel bad. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8748.0s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8751.0s)]
*  But some people will do that. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8752.0s)]
*  They'll just, and that's the type of people that leave comments. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8754.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8757.0s)]
*  I can't read those things. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8758.0s)]
*  It's so gnarly. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8759.0s)]
*  On the distracted driving, and this is something that I super wanted to talk to you about because you were interested in, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8760.0s)]
*  podcasting in a van. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8768.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8770.0s)]
*  Like, I was very, very reluctant to jump on the podcast bandwagon. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8771.0s)]
*  I just thought, fuck everybody and their mom has a fucking podcast. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8777.0s)]
*  You know, and it's been, like over the years, one of the more annoying questions, like, will you do my podcast? [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8783.0s)]
*  You know, like, for God's sakes, like, I don't want to spend a whole. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8790.0s)]
*  You think that's annoying? [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8795.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, like, in the case where people don't have an audience, I'm going to spend a whole. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8796.0s)]
*  It's so much better than you wanting to do their podcast and them not wanting you to be on. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8801.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8806.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8807.0s)]
*  That, that, that. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8808.0s)]
*  Because once you have a podcast and everybody wants to be on your podcast, and if you don't want them on and they keep pestering you, that's more annoying. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8809.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8815.0s)]
*  I get that. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8816.0s)]
*  I get that. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8817.0s)]
*  But I just, like, for me to make the leap to all of a sudden being the guy asking, will you do my podcast, [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8818.0s)]
*  was a struggle for me. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8825.0s)]
*  And I thought, OK, well, at the very least, let me set it up in a, in a fucking van so I can say, so I can say, dude, wherever and whenever is most convenient, let me bring it to you. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8826.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8838.0s)]
*  And so like that, like, and I could totally wrap my head around that. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8839.0s)]
*  Well, when I first gave a crack at it, I had suction cups on the windows, like, and I'm fucking. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8843.0s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8852.0s)]
*  But yeah, but I'm driving around. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8853.0s)]
*  You're doing it while driving. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8855.0s)]
*  I'm not a very good driver to begin with. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8858.0s)]
*  Yeah, you shouldn't be driving. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8860.0s)]
*  You should be a passenger. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8861.0s)]
*  Have someone drive and sit in the back seat. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8862.0s)]
*  I know, but, but in, in, it was a misfire. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8864.0s)]
*  It was a misfire at that point. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8868.0s)]
*  And then I realized, OK, set it up in the back, you know, park it. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8870.0s)]
*  Tim Poole has a dope setup. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8876.0s)]
*  And I did his setup when he was in town. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8878.0s)]
*  He has a trailer and the trailer is like a full studio with like a large screen television so they could pull up videos. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8880.0s)]
*  It's got Internet, the whole deal. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8889.0s)]
*  And he's got cameras set up and desks. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8891.0s)]
*  It's like really, really well done. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8893.0s)]
*  I was like, ooh, this is good. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8895.0s)]
*  But then I thought about it. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8897.0s)]
*  I do too many podcasts as it is. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8898.0s)]
*  I don't need a fucking mobile podcast studio on top of what I'm already doing. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8899.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8903.0s)]
*  I have to like say I have to get my brain sometimes and corner it and go, hey, stupid. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8904.0s)]
*  You don't have enough time to do what you do. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8909.0s)]
*  Like, why are you trying to do other things? [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8911.0s)]
*  Don't do that. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8913.0s)]
*  Like that to me is a big thing. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8914.0s)]
*  Like, don't do too much. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8915.0s)]
*  Are you still selling fanny packs? [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8917.0s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8920.0s)]
*  Do you have any that aren't leather? [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8921.0s)]
*  No. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8923.0s)]
*  Are you vegan? [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8924.0s)]
*  I'm not vegan. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8925.0s)]
*  I just like I feel weird about about leather. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8926.0s)]
*  Well, if you get leather from a company like White Oaks Pastures, well, they use everything. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8929.0s)]
*  They use chew toys, leather. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8937.0s)]
*  They tan the leather from all their animals. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8941.0s)]
*  You know, I had this guy, Will Harris, who's a regenerative farmer on. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8943.0s)]
*  And he told me they use everything on that animal. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8946.0s)]
*  I could back that. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8950.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8951.0s)]
*  It's very good. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8952.0s)]
*  And that that is the really the best way to get everything. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8953.0s)]
*  But you can't expect that from like I would assume that a cow is very valuable, like as a commodity. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8956.0s)]
*  You know, the meat is valuable. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8965.0s)]
*  There's no way they're going to just shoot a cow for their leather. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8967.0s)]
*  I don't think I think that they do, though. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8970.0s)]
*  I think I think in the factory farming where like they they process the meat to eat, I think they're just fucking throwing away the leather. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8972.0s)]
*  So they're probably throwing away what I'm saying is they're not killing a cow just for the leather. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8983.0s)]
*  I don't think that the factory farming slaughtering cows for beef. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8989.0s)]
*  I think they are throwing away. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8993.0s)]
*  But you know, we're saying the opposite. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8995.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8996.0s)]
*  And then the people who are making it for the leather maybe are throwing away the beef. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=8997.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9000.0s)]
*  Why would they do that, though? [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9001.0s)]
*  It's so valuable. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9002.0s)]
*  Like cows. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9003.0s)]
*  It's thousands of dollars of beef. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9004.0s)]
*  Why would you just throw it away? [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9005.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know about the other way. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9006.0s)]
*  I think that just the fact factory farming so gnarly. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9008.0s)]
*  It's so it's horrible. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9011.0s)]
*  Well, the thing that gets me is like. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9013.0s)]
*  At this point, with the amount of fast food that people desire, and this is the conversation that I had with Will Harris, I said, Is it possible to feed people the way we're doing it now with regenerative farming? [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9018.0s)]
*  And he said, No, he said, not because. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9030.0s)]
*  But should we be feeding people the way we're feeding them now? [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9034.0s)]
*  The question is like, if you have a place like Los Angeles where you have 18,000 people, or probably 18 million people rather, that are living this one spot and no one's growing anything, how are you going to get those people enough food? [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9039.0s)]
*  And his thing was like, maybe we shouldn't be living like that, because that is an unsustainable way to live. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9053.0s)]
*  But that's a giant conversation. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9059.0s)]
*  Like, what are you going to do? [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9061.0s)]
*  Make people move out of the cities? [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9062.0s)]
*  And people like living in cities. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9063.0s)]
*  But can you feed them in a way without factory farming? [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9065.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem like you can. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9069.0s)]
*  It seems like we made those places because we had those other things and they grew because of those other things. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9071.0s)]
*  And now we're kind of stuck in this gross system. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9080.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9084.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's horrifying. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9085.0s)]
*  Those videos. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9088.0s)]
*  I mean, that's how I became a hunter watching PETA videos. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9089.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm either going to be a vegetarian or I'm going to be a hunter because I don't want to participate in that anymore. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9093.0s)]
*  I was trying to figure out like what is... [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9099.0s)]
*  I saw that shit and had the same thought that if you're going to eat meat, you should have to become licensed to do so. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9101.0s)]
*  You know, you should have to kill an animal if you're going to be allowed to eat meat. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9110.0s)]
*  Well, there is definitely a disconnect when people eat meat. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9115.0s)]
*  They think that somehow or another, you know, they're not doing anything bad. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9119.0s)]
*  But those same people sometimes will be upset at hunters. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9125.0s)]
*  They don't like it. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9130.0s)]
*  It's very weird because like if you're hunting, like that animal has the best life possible. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9131.0s)]
*  Sure. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9138.0s)]
*  And honestly, the best death possible is from a hunter. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9139.0s)]
*  If I shoot an elk with a bow and arrow and I hit it in the vitals and that elk dies in seconds, that is the absolute best death that thing is ever going to experience. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9143.0s)]
*  Because if that doesn't happen, they're going to get torn apart by wolves. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9152.0s)]
*  They're going to get eaten by a mountain lion. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9156.0s)]
*  They're going to get ripped apart by a bear. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9158.0s)]
*  Like that is a way worse and way more horrific and freeze to death. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9160.0s)]
*  And, you know, Mount Everest. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9165.0s)]
*  Animals freeze to death every year. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9167.0s)]
*  There's like die-offs like mule deer die-offs every hard winter. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9169.0s)]
*  You'll lose like thousands of mule deer that die off just freeze to death. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9173.0s)]
*  It happens. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9178.0s)]
*  You know, it's like there's trade-offs, right? [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9180.0s)]
*  It's not it's not good in any way. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9182.0s)]
*  And if you want to eat meat, you know, if you want to buy it in a way that you feel good about it, like a regenerative farm is without a doubt the best place to get it from. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9186.0s)]
*  Like a place like White Oak Pastures where they're just they're they're living in these giant fields of grass and they're just roaming around. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9196.0s)]
*  They're 100 percent grass fed. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9204.0s)]
*  They just live like they normally live. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9205.0s)]
*  And then one day they have one bad moment. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9207.0s)]
*  So regenerative farming, regenerative farming means like one ecosystem. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9210.0s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9216.0s)]
*  They they they essentially mimic nature in a controlled space like that documentary. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9218.0s)]
*  The biggest little farmer. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9224.0s)]
*  I don't know about that one. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9228.0s)]
*  But it's probably the same sort of a situation. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9230.0s)]
*  There's a guy named Joel Salatin. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9232.0s)]
*  I've had him on the podcast a couple of times as well. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9234.0s)]
*  And he has a place called Polyface Farms. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9236.0s)]
*  And it's the same sort of a situation where they use the manure to fertilize the land. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9239.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9244.0s)]
*  And then and then they also move the animals around. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9245.0s)]
*  So they're going to new places and and by chewing up the grass the way the cows do, it actually benefits the land. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9248.0s)]
*  And the way Joel Salatin and Will Harris have it with White Oak Pastures, it's actually carbon negative. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9255.0s)]
*  Like they don't produce more carbon. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9262.0s)]
*  They actually sequester more carbon into the earth. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9265.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9267.0s)]
*  You think that more people would do that shit. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9268.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9271.0s)]
*  He lives in this place where he's surrounded by people who do industrialized farming and he does regenerative farming. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9272.0s)]
*  And the stark contrast between the runoff like he showed us a video and there's a river that runs through his area. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9280.0s)]
*  And there is where his farm is. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9288.0s)]
*  And then there's the property line where his neighbor who has an industrialized farm and the industrialized farm, all the topsoil is gone. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9290.0s)]
*  So they're using this all this fucking artificial fertilizer. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9298.0s)]
*  And look at the difference. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9302.0s)]
*  There's a clear line. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9303.0s)]
*  Look at the line. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9305.0s)]
*  So his his river is normal. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9306.0s)]
*  And then if you see that line in the river where to the right of that gentleman is all dark and muddy and fucked up, that's all toxic shit that's getting washed out of the industrialized farm into that river and poisoning the river. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9309.0s)]
*  And people that eat just vegetables and think that they're doing a great thing for the environment, they don't take into account how those vegetables are grown. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9325.0s)]
*  Monocrop agriculture in an industrial setting is devastating to the environment. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9334.0s)]
*  It's devastating to wildlife. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9339.0s)]
*  It's devastating to all the insects and all the different animals that live in those farms. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9341.0s)]
*  And not to mention that all the fucking processed soy and wheat is devastating to your body. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9347.0s)]
*  Oh, sure. And also glyphosate, like the roundup stuff, the fucking fake vegan meat. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9355.0s)]
*  It's horrible. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9363.0s)]
*  I was vegan for a while there. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9364.0s)]
*  And I went to a colon colon colonic hydrotherapy. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9366.0s)]
*  Oh, you got your butt flushed out. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9376.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got my butt flushed out. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9377.0s)]
*  And the person was that it was cool. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9379.0s)]
*  I mean, I was just trying it out. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9382.0s)]
*  But you're the only person who ever said it was cool. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9384.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the person said, oh, man, what are you eating? [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9389.0s)]
*  You know, like you got all this yeasty, you know, like, like, you know, and I was a shit experts. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9393.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm like, I told them I'm vegan. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9401.0s)]
*  And they were like, oh, that's the problem is that like you're eating this highly processed fucking soy and wheat that your body does not recognize as food. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9404.0s)]
*  And clearly, your body is struggling to break it down. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9414.0s)]
*  It's like it's like it's an absurd substance posing as food. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9418.0s)]
*  Well, those impossible burgers we showed a study the other day that was showing that it's toxic for rats. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9423.0s)]
*  And they fed rats the impossible burger and the rats are getting sick. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9429.0s)]
*  Yeah. And if there's many, many healthy vegetarian choices, especially like some Indian cuisine that's vegetarian, it tastes great. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9435.0s)]
*  Good for you. But it's just vegetables. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9443.0s)]
*  It's not that shit. That shit. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9445.0s)]
*  That's a mimicking meat like, oh, yeah. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9447.0s)]
*  And seed oils and all the fucking horrible things that people eat that are supposed to be used as industrial lubricants and they've converted to food for people. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9451.0s)]
*  That's really what seed oils are. Yeah. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9461.0s)]
*  And in the high concentrations and high levels of it, it's very inflammatory. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9464.0s)]
*  Is all these studies done? It causes macular degeneration. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9469.0s)]
*  Like Paul Saladino sent me all these studies that are showing that high levels of seed oils is actually contributing to eyesight diminishing people. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9472.0s)]
*  I bet. Yeah. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9482.0s)]
*  Yeah. What's the really dangerous? [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9484.0s)]
*  Is it unsaturated, polyunsaturated? [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9490.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's fats that the problem with them is when people cook in them, particularly. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9496.0s)]
*  They're not so good for salad dressings either. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9502.0s)]
*  But when people cook in them, they break down under heat. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9504.0s)]
*  And that causes a lot of inflammation in people's bodies when people cook with those seed oils. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9510.0s)]
*  Like, again, they were originally created because like grape seed oil, it was created because they were trying to figure out what to do with these grape seeds. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9517.0s)]
*  Like, oh, maybe we can get oil out of them and process it. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9524.0s)]
*  But it's like highly processed and they have to do something to take the smell out of it and the taste out of it and like really process shit. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9527.0s)]
*  And then when you cook with it, it breaks it down and oxidizes and it's just terrible for you. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9535.0s)]
*  You're supposed to like cook with like beef tallow is really good to cook with. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9540.0s)]
*  But there's some saturated fats and there's some natural fats that are good for like avocado oil is good for you. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9544.0s)]
*  There's oils that are good for you. But those oils are coming from. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9549.0s)]
*  I mean, avocado is essentially a fruit. Right. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9552.0s)]
*  All of us. All of us. Fantastic. Yeah. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9555.0s)]
*  It's like super Italy live forever. Yeah. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9557.0s)]
*  Well, they also have different weed over there, too. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9560.0s)]
*  They go over there and eat pasta and they deal. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9562.0s)]
*  They're dealing with heirloom wheat. Right. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9564.0s)]
*  So our wheat has more complex gluten's in it and it's highly processed to to develop more yield per acre. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9566.0s)]
*  I remember in it was like fucking 2011 or something. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9575.0s)]
*  I'm having dinner with Big Jay O'Curson. I love Big Jay. He's the best. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9580.0s)]
*  He says, What's up? What's up with gluten, man? [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9585.0s)]
*  Five years ago, nobody ever heard of it. Now it's killing everybody. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9589.0s)]
*  It's true. And it's true. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9593.0s)]
*  And I wonder if if if like the process that maybe it's the what do you call it? [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9595.0s)]
*  M.G.O. or whatever modified the modified organism. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9605.0s)]
*  What do you call it? Yeah. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9611.0s)]
*  GMO GMO. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9613.0s)]
*  Genetically modified organisms. Yeah. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9615.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what we're talking about. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9617.0s)]
*  It's like they've what they've essentially done is taking a normal wheat plant [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9618.0s)]
*  and they've engineered it to create a higher yield. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9622.0s)]
*  And because of that, there's more complex gluten's in it. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9626.0s)]
*  And that has it gives your body it's more difficult to break down. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9629.0s)]
*  And is that a newer thing? Yeah. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9633.0s)]
*  So now you've got recent. But, you know, and they don't do it in Italy. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9635.0s)]
*  And they also in Italy, they don't use glyphosate. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9640.0s)]
*  They don't use Roundup like these herbicides. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9643.0s)]
*  Like there was a study recently that showed there was something was like 80 percent, [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9646.0s)]
*  80 percent of the people they tested, they found glyphosate in their blood. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9650.0s)]
*  So you're eating all these plants that have been sprayed with herbicides. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9654.0s)]
*  And that herbicide shows up in your body. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9658.0s)]
*  And all these people, these shells, would be like, oh, well, it's just a small amount. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9661.0s)]
*  It's a small amount of the poison. Don't worry about it. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9665.0s)]
*  It's fine. You should keep using it. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9667.0s)]
*  That's how we're feeding it for blood. It's only one way. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9669.0s)]
*  You got to take the poison. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9672.0s)]
*  And the Monsanto people have at the Monsanto headquarters, they serve organic food. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9674.0s)]
*  Do they really? Yeah. It's like. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9683.0s)]
*  You sure? I think so. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9685.0s)]
*  Is that true? Google that. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9687.0s)]
*  That seems like bad PR. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9689.0s)]
*  Seems like that's going to get out. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9692.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. What? That's hilarious, though. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9694.0s)]
*  It's true. Yeah, they don't fucking fuck with their own shit. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9697.0s)]
*  Well, you know, we're supposed to be eating organisms in the way that they form in nature. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9701.0s)]
*  You know, the healthy things in nature, healthy fruits, healthy vegetables, healthy animals and eggs. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9706.0s)]
*  That's how you're supposed to eat it. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9712.0s)]
*  That's what we know in factory farming, whether it's both monocrop agriculture in terms of growing food and even growing animals. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9714.0s)]
*  Like we're fucking with things. We're fucking with nature. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9722.0s)]
*  And there's there's tradeoffs and consequences when you do that. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9724.0s)]
*  And I don't I think there's definitely people that are just allergic to gluten. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9728.0s)]
*  But, man, I know that when I eat wheat and I eat bread and pasta when I'm in Italy, my body has a different reaction to it. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9732.0s)]
*  You don't feel as like weighed down. You know, you don't feel as like bloated. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9741.0s)]
*  Yeah. But then again, bread's delicious. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9747.0s)]
*  Fucking good, man. Nice piece of bread with some butter on it. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9751.0s)]
*  Oh, so good. Nice fucking slice of lasagna. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9755.0s)]
*  I think it's one of those every now and then things like I was in New York City this past weekend. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9759.0s)]
*  I ate at this great Italian place called Carbone. I saw that. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9765.0s)]
*  Oh, it's amazing. So good. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9768.0s)]
*  If you go there, try the spicy rigatoni. It's fantastic. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9771.0s)]
*  But it's like don't do it every day. But I got to tell you, the next day I felt a little fat, felt a little bloated. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9773.0s)]
*  Yeah, I went for a while there and I was avoiding flour and sugar. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9779.0s)]
*  And my buddy says, man, whatever cookies you're eating must suck. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9785.0s)]
*  Well, they make cookies with like almond flour that are pretty good. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9791.0s)]
*  You can buy gluten free cookies that aren't bad. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9795.0s)]
*  So one of my kids has an legit allergy to gluten. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9798.0s)]
*  Celiac disease. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9801.0s)]
*  No, it's not that. It's not that bad. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9803.0s)]
*  I have a friend who has celiac disease though, and he didn't find out about it until he was like 30. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9805.0s)]
*  Like he just was trying to figure out what was going on. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9809.0s)]
*  That's the best answer I could find on the Monsanto thing. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9811.0s)]
*  I haven't asked you, Grant, Monsanto CEO, this question directly, but I'll say he doesn't care. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9813.0s)]
*  Here's why I feel like I can say that. I work in the same building, just a floor away. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9818.0s)]
*  We both regularly eat in our campus cafeteria. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9822.0s)]
*  And our cafeteria is just regular food. Most of us prioritize nutrition, freshness, taste, et cetera. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9825.0s)]
*  We also like to purchase products that we have a connection to. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9831.0s)]
*  We always get great turnout when we have products that come in directly from customers. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9834.0s)]
*  That's true whether they're conventional, GMO, or organic. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9839.0s)]
*  That's like a non-answer. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9843.0s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds like... [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9845.0s)]
*  Yeah. I can say he doesn't care. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9847.0s)]
*  I haven't asked the CEO this question directly, but I'd say he doesn't care. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9850.0s)]
*  Well, if you're asking them, like, if he doesn't care, right, [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9855.0s)]
*  do you think Monsanto CEO eats organic or doesn't really care? [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9859.0s)]
*  That's just the CEO. Say he doesn't care. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9862.0s)]
*  They have some information like that on their website, too. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9865.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, who knows if he cares? [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9868.0s)]
*  Maybe he's just greedy. He just wants that cheddar. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9871.0s)]
*  You know, he just wants to keep making that cash. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9874.0s)]
*  A lot of money in Monsanto. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9877.0s)]
*  Dude, let me tell you about what I'm selling for cheddar. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9879.0s)]
*  You're selling things? What are you selling? [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9883.0s)]
*  You got a bag of stuff you're selling? [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9886.0s)]
*  Stevo's butt wipes for your butthole. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9889.0s)]
*  Well, that's where generally you'd use a butt wipe. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9892.0s)]
*  Yeah, flushable butt wipes. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9895.0s)]
*  You wouldn't use it for your cheeks. They're flushable? Not really. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9897.0s)]
*  Let me tell you something about those flushable butt wipes. Don't flush them. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9900.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah? [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9903.0s)]
*  No. They all fucking clog. Talk to a plumber. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9904.0s)]
*  Those fucking things all clog up. They don't break down. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9906.0s)]
*  They all get stuck. They get stuck in pipes. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9910.0s)]
*  I picked the wrong place to fucking... [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9913.0s)]
*  Google are butt wipes flushable? Flushable butt wipes. Are they flushable? [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9916.0s)]
*  They're not. They tell you don't flush them. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9921.0s)]
*  If you flush... Talk to a plumber. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9924.0s)]
*  They fucking have people's pipes clogged up all the time with those things. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9926.0s)]
*  It's like essentially a cloth. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9930.0s)]
*  You're fucking... You're flushing a rag down the toilet. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9933.0s)]
*  You're not even supposed to flush paper towels. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9937.0s)]
*  Paper towels break down in your hand when you get them wet. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9940.0s)]
*  Those things don't break down. Don't tell those. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9942.0s)]
*  I love that. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9945.0s)]
*  Find out, though. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9946.0s)]
*  Two answers come up. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9947.0s)]
*  One, a company selling it says theirs are flushable, showing a video of it. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9949.0s)]
*  You can flush them. That's not the point. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9954.0s)]
*  The point is they're not going to break down. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9957.0s)]
*  They're going to make their way out into wherever the fuck that water goes. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9959.0s)]
*  This is what their video shows are breaking down. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9962.0s)]
*  But again, this is theirs, and I don't know that all of them are made this way. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9965.0s)]
*  That's toilet paper, buddy. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9969.0s)]
*  No, no. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9971.0s)]
*  Hold on. Go back. Go back to that video. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9972.0s)]
*  One of them was toilet paper. The other was the flushable wipe. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9974.0s)]
*  Right, but the flushable wipe wasn't breaking down. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9976.0s)]
*  The toilet paper was breaking down. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9978.0s)]
*  The flushable wipe on the right is breaking down slower. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9981.0s)]
*  I guess so. Cottonel. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9986.0s)]
*  Break down like toilet paper. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9988.0s)]
*  All right. Maybe they're making it different. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9990.0s)]
*  Yep. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9992.0s)]
*  But I know there's flushable wipes that my plumber told me don't fucking flush these things. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9993.0s)]
*  This one says... [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9998.0s)]
*  So this one says don't do it. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=9999.0s)]
*  Dangers of flushing those flushable wipes. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10001.0s)]
*  People aren't flushing wipes down the toilet. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10003.0s)]
*  Oh, people are flushing flushable wipes down the toilet. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10006.0s)]
*  This is causing dangerous problems. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10010.0s)]
*  Toilet paper is designed to disintegrate in our pipes and sewage system, but flushable wipes are not. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10012.0s)]
*  They're typically made with synthetic materials, plastics, or polyester that won't break down. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10017.0s)]
*  So even if they flush down your toilet, they end up clogging our sewers. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10021.0s)]
*  So maybe that other stuff that Cottonel sends, the cells, does break down. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10024.0s)]
*  Hold on. Go back. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10029.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10030.0s)]
*  It says as wipes meet cooking fat in the sewage system, it builds up into a monstrous obstacle, aka a fat burg. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10031.0s)]
*  I've seen that. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10041.0s)]
*  A mass of solid waste consisting of cooking fats, disposable wipes, tampons, and other sanitary items that get flushed down the commode. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10042.0s)]
*  They're unhygienic, expensive to fix, and incredibly gross. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10052.0s)]
*  If you're curious, just check out the Museum of London's fat burg autopsy. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10056.0s)]
*  Clogs and fat burgs make jobs that are already hazardous and very difficult, even more so. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10062.0s)]
*  So whatever that Cottonel stuff that breaks down, maybe that's better. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10068.0s)]
*  Or maybe whatever it breaks down to is toxic. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10072.0s)]
*  I don't know what it's made out of. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10076.0s)]
*  Look into this. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10078.0s)]
*  But now, regardless of what happens after you flush it, the experience of using a butt wipe is way better than toilet paper. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10079.0s)]
*  It is way better than toilet paper. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10087.0s)]
*  I fucking love it, man. I couldn't wipe my butt with dry toilet paper ever again. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10088.0s)]
*  Do you use one of those toilets that squirts water in your butt? [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10092.0s)]
*  Ah, did Tushy? Love it. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10097.0s)]
*  Those are the best. We have them here. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10098.0s)]
*  Love that shit. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10100.0s)]
*  Game changer. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10101.0s)]
*  Big time. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10102.0s)]
*  You're supposed to wash your butt off. You're not supposed to smear shit over it with paper. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10103.0s)]
*  On my podcast, of all the sponsors that I do ad reads for, I always say my favorite sponsor of the podcast is Tushy. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10108.0s)]
*  It's a legit product. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10120.0s)]
*  It's the best. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10121.0s)]
*  And the Tushy one, you can connect to a regular toilet. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10122.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10124.0s)]
*  You don't even need to buy a whole new toilet. It's a pretty simple setup. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10125.0s)]
*  And then they came out with the new one that's a whole toilet seat that comes with it. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10129.0s)]
*  And the toilet seat's heated. It's got a remote control. You control the temperature of the water you're blasting your butthole with. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10135.0s)]
*  Yes. So much better. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10143.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10146.0s)]
*  Yeah, once you do that, the first time I experienced that was in Japan. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0AgO0yASo&t=10147.0s)]
