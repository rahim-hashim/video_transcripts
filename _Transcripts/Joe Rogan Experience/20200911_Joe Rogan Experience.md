# Joe Rogan Experience #1535 - Tim Kennedy
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 11, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDKYSLDq6es)
*  Joe Rogan podcast, check it out!
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Train my day, Joe Rogan podcast, my night, all day!
*  What's going on?
*  Well, I've, of course, come bearing gifts to two new Texans, so that's a separate thing.
*  But I did, I was at the range, working, and I was wearing a Hawaiian shirt.
*  It wasn't even a Hawaiian shirt. I had bought it in Czech Republic.
*  But it looked like a Hawaiian shirt.
*  And in the comments section, I was in body armor, I had my gun, I was literally working.
*  Everybody was like, oh my gosh, you're wearing a Hawaiian shirt.
*  You're part of this super extremist, like white supremist group.
*  And I was like, what? I'm wearing a Hawaiian shirt.
*  And they start freaking out, like cancer culture.
*  And I was like, I bought that. It doesn't matter where I bought it.
*  But now, because you're telling me I'm not supposed to wear it,
*  because I guess Hawaiian shirts are a uniform for white supremists.
*  Oh, God, please Google this. This is a new thing.
*  What? Hawaiian shirts are white supremists?
*  So, of course, the first thing I did was like, buy every Hawaiian shirt I can possibly find,
*  just because I'm not supposed to.
*  Who the fuck is saying this? I need to see this.
*  That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
*  How can a Hawaiian shirt be white supremacist?
*  I don't think there's any logic ever attached to any of these things.
*  But I think the Boogaloo bros...
*  Yeah, so that's what the Wall Street Journal says.
*  Why do the extremist Boogaloo boys wear Hawaiian shirts?
*  Please put that up on the screen.
*  I need to see this fucking nonsense.
*  What? Oh, my God, this is real.
*  Why the extremist Boogaloo boys wear Hawaiian...
*  I'm not joking.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Aloha shirts have become a disconcerting signature
*  for members of a gun-toting anti-government...
*  What does it say? You made it a little too big.
*  I work for the government.
*  So, does that cancel this?
*  Oh, my God.
*  In the past couple weeks, following the killing of George Floyd,
*  curiously dressed counter-protesters have attended scattered demonstrations
*  across the US armed and disconcertingly garbed
*  in Magnum P.I. style floral Hawaiian shirts.
*  Magnum P.I. is pretty fucking American.
*  Yeah, it's pretty epic. Three things here.
*  They're really comfortable.
*  Floral is a great pattern.
*  And they're very breathable.
*  And on the range, I like to do the top button thing
*  and pop a collar so you don't get hot brass down your neck
*  because we're shooting a ton.
*  So it's like, don't get burned.
*  Don't want to be a redneck.
*  You know, like I hate white supremacists, but...
*  What's wrong with Hawaiian shirts?
*  We can't let them take away Hawaiian shirts.
*  No, that's the exact point that I'm trying to...
*  I was like, you tell me the things that I'm not supposed to do.
*  And I'm going to do those things because I'm not going to let you take those things from me.
*  There they are.
*  Far right Boogaloo movement is using Hawaiian shirts.
*  Oh, that's a chubby shirt.
*  The dude right there on the far right, I have that shirt.
*  I have that shirt.
*  Oh, they're wearing the shirts to hide their intentions.
*  What?
*  No, they wear them because they're comfortable and they're breathable.
*  And this one's stretchy.
*  They're taking away everything fun.
*  You can't even do OK anymore.
*  Remember? OK is now a white...
*  I still do that.
*  I do too.
*  It's been around way too long.
*  You can't steal OK.
*  Scuba diving, skydiving, military.
*  Like I can't...
*  I don't know what the other symbol is for not OK.
*  There's some things that it's like gay people took over the rainbow.
*  OK, you can have the rainbow.
*  I don't know.
*  I like my son really likes the rainbow.
*  I like rainbows too.
*  He's five.
*  I don't.
*  I'll still wear a rainbow.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  For sure.
*  But I do recognize that it's...
*  I mean, at least they have partial ownership of it.
*  Yeah.
*  But like the OK sign, you know, you can use the emojis to text people.
*  Yeah.
*  And I cannot help but use the OK sign.
*  It's still on the emojis?
*  Yeah, it is.
*  For any positive response.
*  Controversial.
*  It's not.
*  What about thumbs up?
*  When's that going to be bad?
*  Yeah, pretty soon.
*  It has to be.
*  It's so fucking stupid.
*  It is in some other country, correct?
*  Thumbs up is?
*  Yeah, when I was young, they always taught us like middle finger means something in America,
*  but in like some other country it doesn't.
*  But like thumbs up in some countries real bad.
*  Sort of like cunt in English?
*  Like the Italians do the chin thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck you.
*  Different countries mean different things.
*  Oh, OK.
*  I don't know how bad it really means.
*  I don't know if they're really going to get pissed, but I've heard that.
*  I've heard always.
*  I want to find out where the thumbs up is bad.
*  I'm never going there.
*  Can't do thumbs up.
*  I want to find out where saying OK is bad and then, oh, dang it, we're already here.
*  Most of those started off with 4chan, just fucking around.
*  4chan was just pretending.
*  In Iran, Greece, Russia, Sardinia, and parts of West Africa, the thumbs up is as rude as
*  the middle finger is in the UK.
*  So no posing in front of the Parthenon, making the thumbs up gesture like a nerdy tourist.
*  Oh, God.
*  I'm doing it.
*  If I go there, I'm going to do that for sure.
*  I'm in West Africa a bunch.
*  This is OK.
*  OK.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's only black people there.
*  So nobody's getting mad at my OK symbol.
*  They probably do it too.
*  I've got a picture of Beyonce doing it.
*  I saved a bunch of pictures of black folks doing the OK symbol.
*  I was sending it to my friends.
*  People were saying that there's something wrong with the OK.
*  You can't take away something that's been around forever that just means OK.
*  And the thing about there were some people that were doing it upside down.
*  So that's a military thing.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Explain that.
*  It's an asshole.
*  This is an asshole.
*  So the game is at any moment, we're talking over here, you're like, oh, man, I hurt my
*  leg down here.
*  And if you look at it, I got you.
*  And I get to flick you in the dick.
*  Really?
*  So like, pop.
*  Wait a minute.
*  But you can cancel it if you can get your finger in there.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  So it's a game that has existed in every single basic training.
*  You have to remember that the audience that we're talking about here, like these are guys
*  that are volunteering to go to war.
*  So they're not right.
*  But I mean, this for as long as I've been in the military for 16 years, this is an asshole.
*  And the game has always been like, gotcha.
*  And it's a gotcha moment if they look down at it.
*  So if you do that, that that thing, and then someone sees it, they have to stick their
*  finger in it or you hit them in the dick.
*  Yep.
*  OK.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the game.
*  To the game.
*  I was trying to tell you like two years ago, I still would play this with my friends, but
*  it became this whole thing.
*  But I never heard of this.
*  It could also be Internet fortune meme shit where they're taking it to another level and
*  giving.
*  But do you remember when those cops, that's what they all got in trouble because they
*  were taking a picture and everyone saying these cops are doing the white power thing.
*  But you're saying that's not what that is now.
*  So West Point at one of the recent graduations, I think Trump spoke there.
*  A bunch of the West Point graduates were doing that symbol because of the WNP.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's what the article was like.
*  Oh, no.
*  A bunch of white supremacists are graduating from West Point.
*  And so there's a huge military investigation.
*  I mean, Pentagon sending people out to research this.
*  And they're like, oh, shoot.
*  It's them playing an asshole game.
*  This is this is actually not better because now our West Point, the most prestigious
*  military academy, our graduates are playing their senior year at a Trump graduation.
*  The asshole game and the asshole game has consequences.
*  And those are dick slaps.
*  That's right.
*  Unless you get your finger in there and then you're safe.
*  That's so fucking ridiculous.
*  We have to we have to like amuse ourselves.
*  Well, the problem is with someone to be able to write an article like that and say this
*  is a white power symbol.
*  And then all of a sudden these people get labeled as white supremacists.
*  And then there's no repercussion because once the article is out there, even if you have
*  a retraction, the original article is still out and the damage is done.
*  Done.
*  And those guys are labeled as white supremacists when they're really just dorks.
*  Have you ever read a retraction?
*  Not one.
*  No, no, I don't believe I have.
*  I mean, maybe someone showed me one a couple of times.
*  But when someone gets accused of something like that, that's a pretty heinous thing.
*  Like your retractions not going to reach the same amount of people.
*  No, I would be enraged if somebody was like, hey, you're a white supremacist because you
*  did this thing.
*  And I was like, I'm not a white supremacist.
*  And that thing is an asshole.
*  Like, how are we going to equal this out here?
*  That's not forgivable.
*  They should be sued.
*  It's like you're doing some irreparable damage to someone.
*  It's just so weird today.
*  Everyone is just like I can't imagine a time where people are more outraged about more
*  things.
*  Yeah, I really think it's just you see more people, but I really just think it's a small
*  percentage of people that are always outraged on both sides all the time.
*  But they have an opportunity to talk about it more now.
*  Yeah, we're all connected and they can piss other people off.
*  I just want to go both sides and like give people big hairy ogre troll hugs and be like,
*  it's all going to be OK.
*  You know, like we love you.
*  It's fine.
*  Yeah.
*  Please stop tweeting like Trump.
*  Just give me your phone.
*  You're not allowed to tweet anymore.
*  At least he's funny sometimes.
*  Sometimes.
*  Sometimes he's fucking funny, man.
*  He makes me laugh like one out of ten times.
*  I will laugh out loud at his tweets.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, yeah.
*  First of all, sometimes I laugh out loud because I can't believe he's the fucking president.
*  I can't believe that guy's the president.
*  And then he'll say some ridiculous shit and I'll just go, oh, my God.
*  When he called the girl that he fucked that porn star, when he called her horse face on Twitter,
*  I was like, this is amazing.
*  This is so crazy.
*  I'm amazed that that man's president.
*  Right now.
*  President, acting president, calling a woman he fucked horse face.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, my God.
*  It's just the weirdest.
*  2020.
*  What a time.
*  Oh, it's amazing.
*  But I mean, you know, there's some I wish I could be doing stand up right now.
*  You know, if I could do stand up, it would be more fun.
*  Because it'd be stuff.
*  I mean, so much material here.
*  But yeah.
*  But actual material that you could work out about today.
*  Holy shit.
*  There's never been a bigger gold mine that we hit.
*  Everybody's like, get the pans out of the river.
*  I don't think you're allowed to talk about it, though.
*  Oh, yeah, you are.
*  I mean, yeah, I know you think that comedians should be allowed as I do.
*  I think comedy is the best way to address socially sensitive issues.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if you can't.
*  One of the things about the military is there's a lot of dark humor and people kind of look at us as these scarred, damaged people because of that humor.
*  But the truth is, like, we're able to talk about those things through this humor and whether it's like a release for post-traumatic stress or just how we're able to get to the next day, how we're able to go and do some of the things that we do.
*  It's because we're allowed to joke and laugh and burn that stuff off these sensitive times.
*  And I think that's what comedy does to these socially charged issues.
*  Yes.
*  And, you know, JP Sears, long haired, kind of hippie YouTuber, he has been recently kind of attacking how comedians can't make jokes right now and how everything has been charged.
*  And there's not a way like you can't make racist, sexist jokes or political jokes whatsoever without being canceled.
*  And I was like, that's the best time to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Ari Shafir had the best quote about that.
*  He said, this is a great time for comedy because comedy is actually dangerous again.
*  It's cool.
*  It's actually dangerous.
*  Yeah.
*  Whereas like five years ago, you would say something people didn't like it.
*  They didn't come see you.
*  Now they'll attack.
*  Yeah.
*  And you have consequences.
*  But I think you just have to structure your bits better.
*  You have to you have to treat them like Doug Stanhope has a great quote that he was talking to me about.
*  He said, I go over my bits like I'm a defense attorney.
*  Like I like I'm going over my bits like I'm being prosecuted with, you know, someone's using the bit against me.
*  And so I have to figure it out like a defense attorney.
*  I'm like, that's a great way of looking at it.
*  Yeah. But what a horrible approach in the process to it isn't it isn't because he writes the joke first and then he figures out how to make it bulletproof.
*  You know, I have my method is usually I shit on myself so hard that by the time I get to shitting on someone else, like I've already figured out like most of my bits that are controversial.
*  They start out with me belittling myself like in the most vicious way I can like explaining what a fucking idiot I am.
*  And then all the dumb shit that I've done that's related to this thing.
*  And they're like when I wanted to make a joke about Caitlyn Jenner, what I talked about was the first thing I talked about is how living with all women, I have three daughters and my wife like I described it was it's like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles every day they take two.
*  Like you have so many marbles.
*  God is every day snatch a marble snatch a marble.
*  And my whole bit was getting to I was one.
*  I wanted to get to people are saying he was born a woman.
*  He's always been a woman.
*  I was like maybe or maybe if you live with crazy bitches long enough all the time they fucking turn you into one.
*  Maybe you go crazy.
*  Maybe that too, especially those ones, especially those ones.
*  And so I had to figure out a way to do it.
*  And so I came up with this thing where they're demons and they whisper in his ear in the middle of the night and they talk him into being a woman.
*  But it took forever to figure out a way.
*  But I have but it worked like it worked and people didn't get mad at me for it.
*  I just had to figure out a way to do it where first of all, I belittle myself and then I explain it in a way where it's not it's not dehumanizing trans people.
*  It's just it's like saying, are we sure?
*  Yeah, are we sure?
*  We lost a fucking Olympic gold medalist.
*  God damn it.
*  We lost one of our greatest athletes ever.
*  You look in the record book.
*  What is it saying now under Bruce Jenner?
*  What does it say?
*  I don't.
*  Is he even allowed to say that anymore?
*  I don't think you can.
*  Wikipedia is going to put up whatever they want, which won't be factual.
*  But how would the record books portray how they handle it?
*  If you say that on Twitter, you'll get banned for life.
*  If you call him Bruce Jenner on Twitter, it's dead naming.
*  They'll ban you for life.
*  Good to know.
*  It's hilarious.
*  Yeah, that that vexes me in a different way.
*  Yeah.
*  The fact that you have to think about a joke and its political or cancel culture
*  amications to make sure it's politically correct enough for it to be bulletproof,
*  whether you're like your defense attorney.
*  That sucks to me.
*  It doesn't.
*  It doesn't.
*  Because it is.
*  It's an opportunity to make your jokes better.
*  You could just make them.
*  And again, if you can get away with it, it's more sweet.
*  It's more juicy.
*  Yeah.
*  I've really like that First Amendment thing.
*  I really like being people being able to say things that make my blood boil.
*  And I don't want them to say things that are like, I don't want to drink this coffee when
*  it's lukewarm.
*  Right.
*  And I think that's what conversation is when you're when you're everything politically
*  correct is just this disgusting, gross version.
*  If I'm gonna have champagne, I want to be freaking cold.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I know what you're saying.
*  Perfect.
*  Thirty six degrees.
*  I don't want lukewarm coffee.
*  I don't lukewarm champagne.
*  I want perfect.
*  I want perfect.
*  And that's what that's what communication is.
*  And when you start neutering how someone can talk, like that's not being able to express
*  an idea.
*  You're limiting the counter that those that when you do get away with it, it makes it
*  even more powerful.
*  A joke.
*  Like I'm telling you, man, the jokes that I've said on stage that are against political
*  correctness that are good, like the way I've figured out a way to weave some of them when
*  they hit, man, they hit like a bomb.
*  Like the whole room was like, like they know I go, you know, I'm right.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like I'm not a bad person.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  No.
*  Like I have this this whole chunk that I do on on banning words and the whole chunk is
*  like it took forever to figure out how to manipulate it and get it to this place where
*  it's you could sneak it in on people and sneak it in on people that would ordinarily say
*  those words in polite company and people would their assholes would tense up.
*  But you can get it in.
*  And when you get it in, whoo, it's a BAM.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm with you, man.
*  You know, I want whiskey to get me drunk.
*  I don't want fake whiskey.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not interested.
*  I think there should be consequences.
*  I think I think the best way to combat things that you disagree with is to say how you feel
*  that not to say that person shouldn't be able to say that.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  That's dumb.
*  I watched this video yesterday and these guys are just saying dumb shit.
*  We were talking about people getting cloned in China and this lady goes deep platform
*  that shit seriously.
*  She's like, like what?
*  No, I want dumb people to say dumb things.
*  Yes, especially our politicians like the I think the art of listening has been lost.
*  One of the best things about I think this podcast is that you're a good listener, right?
*  It takes it takes a decently smart human that has a self confidence and developed interpersonal
*  skills to listen.
*  That's lost in current culture where I am going to get so this this this really outraged
*  at something that somebody's saying.
*  I can't even hear their point of view.
*  Even if that point of view is wrong, you want that person to say that.
*  Yeah.
*  And the dumber it is, the more I want them to say it because the dumber they sound and
*  the more we collective logical reasonable person people are like, well, that person's
*  really dumb and his ideas are not going to work.
*  So let's not follow him anymore.
*  And then we're able to to have a counter.
*  This is what's wrong with what that person said.
*  But the idea you're supposed to deep platform them.
*  It's so bad.
*  It's so stupid because then what if someone thinks that they should deep platform you?
*  And I think you probably should be deep platform for telling people they should be deep platformed.
*  How about that?
*  If you're the person that if that's more dangerous than some dummy thinking that they're cloning
*  people in China.
*  And by the way, they might be cloning people.
*  I just don't know.
*  I mean, who the fuck?
*  Look, they can clone people.
*  We know that we know anybody's going to do it.
*  Yeah, they're going to do it.
*  They're probably doing it.
*  They're probably doing it.
*  Look, I mean, it's probably the least of our concerns.
*  You know, I mean, as far as overpopulation goes, I mean, China's trying not to have as
*  many people.
*  They mean they had a one child policy forever.
*  It turned out to be disastrous and tilted everything extraordinarily male.
*  I mean, I would not want to be a man in China trying to find a woman.
*  No.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I don't know if that balance that out yet, but that was a real issue for a long
*  time.
*  I wouldn't want to be in China at all because I'm a big fan of freedom.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Freedom's nice.
*  Pretty, pretty, pretty powerful.
*  It's goddamn important.
*  When you say deep platforming people, you don't think you're taking away freedom, but
*  you are.
*  You're taking away a little bit of freedom.
*  And I think it's extra important right now where people have been isolated for this,
*  whatever, six, five months now from COVID, where they're creating echo chambers when
*  they're when they curate their own information access.
*  We're like, I'm not going to listen to this guy or I want this guy to be platformed or
*  any of the social media is obviously are limiting what kind of voices are being heard.
*  While you're sitting there at home for the past four months and you're just in this echo
*  chamber of your own ideas and people that agree with you, it magnifies and radicalizes
*  what you believe.
*  And there's no logical sound soundboard.
*  There's no bounce off.
*  There's no pressure check.
*  There's no refiner's fire to those ideas because it's an echo chamber.
*  And like you're reading the exact same things on Twitter.
*  You're seeing the same things on Facebook.
*  You're looking at the same things on Instagram.
*  Then you turn on the TV.
*  And of course they're saying all the same things that you already agree with.
*  They're just these ideas continue and gain momentum.
*  And they're not real because I've never been tested against anything that disagrees with
*  them or that that contradicts them.
*  And all I think all ideas have to go through that process for them to be real.
*  Is that that that refiner's fire of is this really going to work?
*  Well, let's apply pressure and find out.
*  Yeah, there's this is defund the police thing that's going on right now.
*  My friend Matt had this funny thing that happened.
*  He has a son.
*  His son's about 25, I think he said.
*  And his son was talking about defunding the police and he's arguing with him.
*  His son's, you know, real liberal and the whole deal.
*  Then his son was staying at the beach house.
*  It's an old house.
*  The house was making like some crazy noises.
*  He ran outside and called his dad and he said, there's something going on in the house.
*  I'm going to call the police.
*  He goes, I thought you wanted to defund the police.
*  He goes, now the fucking house is haunted and you're calling the police?
*  What you went from defund the police to the house is making noise.
*  Let me call the cops.
*  That's a pretty fast jump.
*  I mean, that's not only idiotic, it's dangerous.
*  It's dangerous and stupid.
*  And it's everything.
*  It's everything wrong with these ideas that just get propagated online with that no one
*  really thinks through. But then they get they become a thing that you if you're cool, you
*  say it. If you're in the right group, you say it.
*  And that's what defund the police is.
*  And even fighting against those ideas for some reason, you like if I I believe defunding
*  the police is the dumbest thing you could possibly do.
*  Do I think there might be problems within law enforcement that should be addressed for
*  sure? For sure.
*  Like how do you fix those?
*  You need funding. You need funding, right?
*  Like I have a school that's underperforming.
*  Kids are not graduating from high school.
*  Do we should do we should take money from the school and we should give them fewer teachers?
*  And let's see if that's going to help.
*  No, that's not going to help.
*  You have to give them more teachers.
*  You have to give them more funding.
*  You have to give them more access to information.
*  And then maybe that school starts performing a little better.
*  But a police department is known there's just humans.
*  All right. They're imperfect.
*  They need training. They need funding.
*  They need support. Right now, they need morale and they need people.
*  And they need to get rid of the people that suck.
*  Yeah, they need those things, too.
*  And one of the best ways to do that is through training.
*  You weed people out. You find out who can't cut it.
*  That's what that's what it's supposed to be for.
*  Yeah. The one of the best things about special operations is that there's so much.
*  Training and process the refiner's fire, the chaff in the wind, like you throw that stuff
*  up and the crap blows away and the good stuff comes back down.
*  Then you take that stuff and you go and carry it into a fire and then you heat it
*  and then you pull it out and you pound it.
*  Then you hit it again. You pound it and you hit it and pound it.
*  And what you're left with at the end is this pretty cool thing.
*  If any of that is with law enforcement, all of those things can only occur through
*  training. And if you want to test somebody, if you want to check, if you want to find
*  racism, like having them show up to work for eight hours and letting them hop in a car
*  and run out, you're never going to know what's inside of there.
*  The only time you get access, you get peaks of that is at these stressful, emotionally
*  drained moments. Yes.
*  And the only time that you can create those is through training.
*  I've been arguing that we should have that for all of our leaders.
*  Like when we were talking about the mayor of California or the mayor of Los Angeles
*  and the governor of California and the people that are deciding you can't trick or treat
*  this year. This is the new thing.
*  The one fucking holiday where you have to wear a mask.
*  You're supposed to wear a mask.
*  And they for whatever reason, they've decided they're going to save people by stopping
*  little kids, the ones who have the least problem with this disease from trick or
*  treating. It's fucking asinine.
*  It's so dumb. And I think part of it is because the people that are in that position,
*  the people that are in the position of control, they don't have to be tested.
*  They don't have to show their character.
*  They just have to win a popularity contest that no one wants to enter.
*  No one wants to be the fucking mayor of L.A.
*  Who's who's entering?
*  No one wants to be the governor of California.
*  How many people self-serving people are entering?
*  You know, Mayor Adler here in Austin.
*  You know, like, yeah, same shit.
*  Yeah. Just get out of here.
*  Yeah. Is is there a public servant that wants to step up?
*  You know, I want Eminem to sing that song with a real public servant step up.
*  There's nobody. They get so scrutinized and it's such a ruthless business.
*  Yeah. That the only people that you get left are these wishy washy milky people.
*  And I do wish that, you know, political parties were afraid of the people again.
*  Yeah. That that created a really healthy balance where
*  they understand that they represent that they represent their constituents.
*  And their job is to do what their people want.
*  Once they get into this certain level of political power,
*  they kind of just do whatever they want.
*  And they forget that they're supposed to be representing the people.
*  I've never seen California so charged right now against California.
*  Like people are mad.
*  You know, the protests in Long Beach and San Diego and Mar-a-Lago.
*  Like, it's crazy the number of people that are coming out and being like,
*  I'm not OK with what's happening right now.
*  And they shouldn't be. It's insane.
*  Well, they've given dorks the ability to tell people they can't work.
*  That's what it is. Yeah.
*  And that's Governor Newsom and Mayor Garcetti.
*  Those guys are dorks.
*  And they're in control of whether or not people can take risks and work.
*  How can somebody tell you not to work?
*  It's not scientific. It's not politically correct.
*  It's even if it were scientific.
*  How can you tell me not to work? Right.
*  Well, you can't. Well, the idea is that you're putting other people at risk
*  by working because if you get infected, other people are going to get infected, too.
*  This is this the idea behind, but it's a super flawed idea.
*  I'll super one.
*  I'll volunteer to inject my neck with a hypodermic needle full of covid
*  compared to my children starving to death because I don't work. Yeah.
*  And some like the salon owners are like, if I don't open up,
*  I'm already four months behind on my on my mortgage or my rent
*  to include this building.
*  I'm going to be homeless, as are my kids.
*  And you're going to be dealing with that next month.
*  If I don't open right now, these are people who are just leaving the state.
*  They're like, well, I'm going to go somewhere where I have freedom.
*  And that's why so many people are coming here to Texas.
*  Yeah. Well, they better remember why they left. Exactly.
*  That's important. I wanted to talk to you about that.
*  And I want to have Texas politicians on to try to explain
*  what the checks and balances are in the state that have kept it from being fucked up
*  and given it the freedom that it enjoys right now.
*  And one of the reasons why people are coming here in the first place in droves.
*  Yeah. I mean, from New York and California, I've
*  I argue if you walk downtown Austin, if you walked even up north like
*  Lamar, Palmer and you usually hey, where you from?
*  Four out of five people are going to be from California and New York.
*  And like you're not you're not from Texas to include myself and you
*  and you like all of us from originally California, Central California.
*  How did you get out here?
*  After.
*  Nine eleven happened, I enlisted and, you know, Georgia, Fort Bragg deployments,
*  Georgia, Fort Bragg deployments that cycle
*  and when I was fighting, I.
*  I like Texas and I could kind of live anywhere
*  if I was going to go to New Mexico and do my training camps.
*  My wife is from the south, so she wanted to live in the south.
*  She's from Louisiana.
*  She took a dog. She was a government contractor, so she took a government
*  contracting job here and, you know, it was we knew we were going to be in Texas.
*  We didn't know where and Austin felt like California.
*  So that's really how we ended up here is they had to go
*  they have a special operative, a huge outside of Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
*  This has the largest group of special operations
*  in the entire country. Really? Yeah. Interesting. Yeah.
*  How did that happen?
*  Texas has the ideals that we kind of stand for.
*  I actually have a present for you from the Texas Special Operations Community.
*  They're like, wait a second.
*  So they when I say they come here in droves,
*  we have hundreds of green berets in the state of Texas
*  in from their border patrol workers that are still serving as green berets.
*  Their police officers, firefighters work for FBI,
*  but they live in Texas so they can be Texans
*  that are green berets that then have their their other shenanigan.
*  Awesome jobs. Huge. Wow. Yeah.
*  You're surrounded by them. I didn't know.
*  Well, they figured out it's awesome here. It is awesome.
*  It's very unusual.
*  I almost feel uncomfortable talking about how great it is here.
*  Yeah. I want to make you uncomfortable in a little bit.
*  Let me give you a present. OK. Give it to me now.
*  All right. So we can do this in Texas.
*  Oh, it's gone.
*  Well, these are cigars.
*  I know they're important.
*  It just says from the special operations forces,
*  the oppressor, the bear and range lead the way.
*  It's our motto. All right.
*  Thank you. Liberators of the oppressed.
*  Damn, that smells good.
*  All right.
*  One of these is yours and one of these is yours.
*  Oh, Jamie. I have to see which one's.
*  All right. So this one's yours.
*  There's a pocket constitution.
*  So any time you're like, man,
*  what are we supposed to do in this instance?
*  You can just pocket constitution. I love it.
*  Yeah. You just reference real fast.
*  Damn, this smells great.
*  You know, we're talking about the First Amendment.
*  Congress will make no law respecting any establishment
*  or religion prohibiting the free exercise thereof,
*  abridging the freedom of speech,
*  press the right of people to peacefully assemble
*  petition of the government to make sure
*  government for redress of grievances.
*  So this has all of them in here.
*  So this gun, I took it has been shot.
*  So I zeroed it for you. Beautiful.
*  Got you a whole third.
*  They bring you guns.
*  Now it's got a little bit loophole Delta Point red dot on there.
*  I love loophole.
*  So this is like ready to ready to go.
*  It's zeroed. It's.
*  Fn five oh nine compact.
*  Paula, hello, Jamie, you got a gun now.
*  Yeah, I did.
*  Jamie, so that is no longer my gun.
*  That is your gun. Thank you very much.
*  Jamie, have you ever shot a gun?
*  I've shot your gun.
*  Oh, Jamie, can you come over here?
*  I shot it. I haven't shot it. Yeah.
*  So I did. On rifles, right?
*  Yeah. That cannon.
*  I didn't know this is a dope what kind of shooter you were.
*  So this adjusts to I can put this on anything
*  in like your bag or a fanny pack.
*  If not, I'll get you a concealed carry holster like that.
*  I love this holster. Thanks.
*  Yeah, it's pretty handmade.
*  So this is an Fn five oh three single stack nine millimeter.
*  So this is like what you could carry here around Austin.
*  And but this is very nice compact gun.
*  A lot of people right now uncomfortable.
*  They've got guys. Are you uncomfortable?
*  Nope. This is your first gun.
*  Come here. Come here. Come here. Give me a hug.
*  Come here.
*  Here we go.
*  Listen, welcome to Texas.
*  You can say I got my first gun from Tim Motherfucking Kennedy.
*  Yeah. How about that?
*  And you never forget that that was because you came to Texas.
*  We're going to go to the range with Tim and Alex Jones.
*  How about that?
*  Oh, Texas only.
*  I think it's a Halloween thing. You can shoot zombies.
*  You can get in a group and shoot zombies, not with real guns, obviously,
*  but like some zombie kill it like real people probably dressed up
*  like zombies that don't take paintball hits. Really?
*  Yeah. And somebody said it to me like, let's go.
*  We have like responsive targets that are built like zombies.
*  So you shoot them and like blood comes out and you can.
*  And we have they call them heavy metal zombie competitions.
*  So it's like a three gun competition.
*  So you have to shoot forty five, three, oh eight and twelve gauge.
*  And you only had shots count.
*  So as you say, so far.
*  That's like fun, right?
*  Oh, I wish I came here years ago.
*  Zombie Safari Dallas is open every Friday and Saturday in October.
*  Well, we're going.
*  Yeah, we have to go to that.
*  Weather's cooling off, so we're going to do a lot more helicopter pig hunts.
*  2400 rounds kill zombies.
*  Now, when you do the helicopter pig hunts, how do you guys gather up the meat?
*  Do you have someone that drives after the helicopter?
*  It drives after the helicopter.
*  It depends on where we're going and what we're doing.
*  So some some branches we're exterminating.
*  So you don't even gather up the meat? No.
*  And some of them are disgusting.
*  Yeah, but the meat's still good. No, it's not gross. Really?
*  No. Why?
*  They're like like you get an old male like maggoty,
*  rancid, gross, tough meat.
*  I don't want that. You get like a young sow.
*  Yeah, but those old ones, though, seriously,
*  if you put them on a smoker and you do it right, you brine them.
*  They still taste good.
*  OK, why would you have five billion pigs in Texas?
*  Why would you cook a nasty one?
*  Would you just go get a nice sweet one over there?
*  And there's so many of them.
*  Like if we go next week, I take you.
*  You would shoot 50 pigs.
*  Why from a helicopter?
*  From a helicopter, why would you pick a gross one?
*  I see what you're saying, but it just seems like you don't want to waste the meat, though.
*  There are people that would like that.
*  Well, let's talk about. No, no, no.
*  Food wise, we're going to compare food meat to.
*  So on a on a farm, 25 percent of your crop is destroyed by feral pigs.
*  Yes. Every year. So if you're if you're
*  if you had a million dollars,
*  you're automatically off the top.
*  Two hundred fifty thousand dollars of your crop is gone to feral pigs.
*  So you as a rancher, you're like seen
*  heavy handed, hairy ogre like me.
*  They're like, wait, you'll come and kill pigs on my property.
*  And you know, I don't have to do anything.
*  They'll welcome you.
*  How many times have you done this?
*  I don't know. Thousand.
*  I don't know.
*  I have no idea.
*  A thousand times from helicopters.
*  Oh, what a great place to be.
*  Yeah. But it's different shooting, though, because instead of a pot.
*  So if something's moving fast,
*  like a vehicle, if I was going to be engaging something moving,
*  let's say from the right to the left.
*  I'm going to. Yeah, you have to lead it.
*  Well, when you're in a helicopter, you actually have to give a negative lead.
*  So you're going to shoot behind it. You're going too fast.
*  Yeah. So whatever speed, if you're going, let's say 80 knots,
*  you're going to have to be behind it about about the tail.
*  And the speed of that helicopter is going to make up the difference
*  to give you a middle impact. Oh, interesting.
*  How fast is the helicopter going when you're shooting?
*  Depends on the pilot.
*  And sometimes that's you as a shooter.
*  You're just kind of having to judge how fast you're going.
*  And, you know, Shane, who will fly with he's a great pilot.
*  And so he'll like can't the helicopter like a 45 degree angle
*  and open up the shooter door towards.
*  So we're only probably going like 30 knots.
*  So you can't.
*  I'm not in miles an hour like one and a half.
*  Why do they use not? I don't know.
*  It's naval and aviation use it just to confuse people. Yeah.
*  Yeah. But at that speed, you can aim point, aim point, impact.
*  Right. Just rack them up.
*  Yeah. Wow. You shot an FN 509 before? No.
*  They're really good. Yeah. Yeah. Strike a fire.
*  You shoot Glock. Yeah.
*  It's real similar trigger. A little bit more combat feely.
*  That's the compact.
*  So you can I don't know, do you carry it?
*  No, I haven't concealed carry.
*  We're going to fix that. OK.
*  Like super fast. All right. Excellent.
*  Good to hear. Yeah. You can't be here.
*  I can't you can see the whole carry state. Right.
*  Open carries dumb. Please don't do that.
*  Yeah. It's like very antagonistic almost.
*  Yeah. But like that's
*  why I believe you have the right to do that.
*  It's also one of those things that's like it's also dumb to do it
*  from a tactical perspective. Right.
*  Why would you be sitting here with the thing that you want? Right.
*  To protect you exposed to the whole entire world and telegraph
*  like if I walk into a room, that's like the first guy I'm like.
*  One, you're probably useless.
*  Two is I'm concerned about you, not as an asset, but rather as a threat.
*  Right. Like there's I don't there's not if you went out to any of the guys
*  out here, any of my friends, you're like, do you open carry the big?
*  No, that's dumb.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  Well, that's that thing that like I was getting into about the protest
*  when people were showing up at these Black Lives Matter protests
*  with AKs around their neck.
*  What are you doing?
*  Do you have any times they have accidentally discharged
*  their weapon into the crowd?
*  Oh, I'm sure it's it's happened like a dozen times.
*  I'm sure it's heartbreaking because like I respect that they're trying to like
*  I fully believe in protesting, love peaceful protests.
*  I even like that that kind of bravado of open carry
*  in that sense where they're like really I think a freedom not exercised
*  is a freedom that's going to atrophy and die.
*  One of the reasons why I love comedy is because you are pushing the limit
*  of what people are comfortable with, especially with the First Amendment.
*  So you're kind of torn on open carry in that sense.
*  I think it's super dumb, but I like people exercising their freedoms.
*  Interesting. Yeah.
*  I see what you're saying, though.
*  The right person like I one, I would never be at a protest of
*  while I support it, I would.
*  It's dangerous to be there right now.
*  So I wouldn't the cost versus gain of
*  what happens at those peaceful protests.
*  And then the thought of even open carrying is is idiotic.
*  I agree with that.
*  I feel like showing up at one of those protests with a gun, like
*  unless they're coming to you and trying to take your house or break down your door.
*  Why do you have it? Why are you walking around with a gun? Just
*  you're supposed to if it's supposed to be a peaceful protest.
*  And the idea is like, what if someone comes to try to disrupt that peaceful protest?
*  Like you're inviting them almost with that gun.
*  Yeah. I mean, we had a poor kid killed here in Austin.
*  He had a K and poor Uber driver
*  got in the middle of a protest and he's like, holy crap.
*  His his, you know, when he dropped, he had a drop off
*  and he went to go do another pickup and Uber like automatically routes
*  the way to go.
*  So he's following his little Uber route and he turns and he's like,
*  oh, man, I'm in the middle of a protest.
*  He's a soldier from Fort Hood right here.
*  And he's concealed carrying in in his Uber vehicle.
*  And he gets stuck in the protest and the protesters just swarm his car.
*  And this this this kid that died,
*  he's actually a really neat kid because, you know, his his girlfriend
*  was black. He's there to support her.
*  She had a bunch of physical physical impairments and she's in a wheelchair.
*  Yeah. So he's like a neat kid.
*  You're like, not smart.
*  He's open caring at a protest.
*  You know, and you're seeing kind of some inflammatory things beforehand.
*  But like I think his point and his purpose was really good and pure
*  and like trying to do the right thing. Right.
*  But then he runs up to the side of a car and points a gun at an Uber driver
*  that is scared and confused and he gets shot.
*  Yeah. Like that's the recipe for disaster.
*  I saw so many different versions of that story, too,
*  where people had twisted the facts.
*  People had said he was unarmed.
*  The guy who got shot.
*  People were saying that the guy who did it was a white supremacist
*  who drove into the protest on purpose.
*  There was so many. The video was edited where it looked like
*  the guy was making a right hand turn and he like sped up
*  because he was trying to get around a person.
*  And they cut right there because it looks like the guy speeding up
*  to go into the crowd.
*  But super when you watch the whole video,
*  it's really obvious what that poor kid was trying to do with the driver.
*  I saw a fascinating this PhD
*  on communication broke down from the initial release
*  of the information of the story, how it immediately started being
*  distorted. Yeah.
*  For two different sides.
*  Like I'm going to leave out this detail.
*  I'm going to include this detail.
*  And by the time you got, you know, the game telephone, we're like, hey,
*  here's this catchphrase.
*  And by the time it gets all the way around the room,
*  it doesn't sound like any semblance of what it did when it started.
*  When you got to the final version,
*  I'm super enraged at one version and I'm super enraged at another version,
*  but neither of them are true.
*  And like that, that's what every single issue is happening
*  from Defunding the Police to Black Lives Matter to Antifa.
*  It's like, can we just be reasonable and talk about what's really happening?
*  And we have some real good examples of what the worst case scenarios
*  are in this country right now.
*  And one of them is Portland.
*  Like Portland is one of the best case scenarios of
*  completely unreasonable, ridiculous shit that's going on every single day.
*  A hundred and one days approach that that fucking mayor up there
*  is the most progressive mayor in the country.
*  And they're like, fuck you, resign.
*  We're going to burn your house down.
*  He had to move out because they're going to burn his place down.
*  They tried to burn down his lobby.
*  They were throwing fiery things into his lobby.
*  They were lighting fires in front of the street, in front of his house,
*  having dance parties in front of his apartment building.
*  So I was just coming back from Africa on an SFA mission,
*  a security forces assistance like a.
*  We the military go to places that have insurgents
*  and we try to legitimize the process of government.
*  So in counterinsurgency, there's like all of these different missions from
*  joint combined exercises for training to foreign internal defense to SFA
*  security forces assistance.
*  And I'm over there doing a counterinsurgency mission and I'm coming back
*  and I'm seeing the same kind of horrible, dangerous recipe in Portland.
*  You know, the same types of.
*  Organization structure and and it's an insurgency
*  is a charged idea
*  that, you know, insurgency as the D.O.D. defines it is
*  an organized group trying to delegitimize or overthrow a constitutional government.
*  Like that's how the D.O.D. defines it.
*  And I think if you went to almost anyone in Portland,
*  they're like, what are you trying to do right now?
*  Like, that's what they're trying to do.
*  Yeah. Right. Like that's what they believe.
*  They're open about it. Yeah.
*  Which is all right.
*  And that creates a really hard.
*  Yeah. How do you combat that?
*  Because you have to combat the grievances and the ideas you have to in as dangerous
*  as it is, those ideas are like a cancer
*  because when truth and information is being adjusted,
*  just like we talked about with the shooting here in Austin,
*  where you have two different versions and some people are in the echo
*  chamber of only hearing one side of it, it just keeps radicalizing
*  more and more and catching more momentum.
*  And then the reason that they're there is is so convoluted with,
*  you know, fear. Are you there for Black Lives Matter?
*  Or are you there to, you know, to to fight systemic racism?
*  Are you here to like, what are you protesting about?
*  Like, I think you'd get a lot of different answers.
*  Yeah. That's dangerous.
*  Like now, now, now you're just there to do damage.
*  Like you're not really trying to do anything that's good.
*  Well, it's also exciting.
*  This is the other thing about it.
*  When when you're allowed to throw fire into the lobby
*  of the apartment building where the mayor lives and no one stops you
*  and you're out in front and people are playing music and dancing
*  and everyone's going, Black Lives Matter.
*  There's excitement to that. Right. Something's happening.
*  And then when you're talking about people that are out of work,
*  the economy is fucked.
*  No one knows what to do.
*  Everyone's scared.
*  COVID's killing a certain percentage of people.
*  You can't do anything about it.
*  There's no vaccines.
*  There's all this tension in the air.
*  And then you have this movement.
*  And then this is the most exciting thing that's happening.
*  And then for people that don't have jobs and can't go anywhere,
*  what the fuck do you want them to do?
*  They're going to get sucked up into that, especially if it aligns
*  with their political ideologies, if they're a left leaning person.
*  And they're like, look, we have a real chance for a real revolution here.
*  And this is but what they don't understand.
*  I was talking about Seattle.
*  You're doing the same thing that you would hate for people to do.
*  You're taking over businesses with force.
*  You're you're occupying land that you don't deserve.
*  You're stealing buildings.
*  You're literally occupying buildings that other people built.
*  And then once you get there, you're establishing boundaries.
*  You're putting up barriers.
*  You have a police force that will attack and brutally beat people up
*  for just filming what they perceive as injustices
*  or what they're going to put on the Internet.
*  And then people get shot and you're calling the fucking cops.
*  You call the police and ambulances when people get shot there.
*  You know how goddamn crazy this is.
*  It's so poorly thought out across the board.
*  And if you do that, if you take over an area,
*  what's to stop people from doing that to you?
*  You've already set a precedent.
*  You've already said we could do this with force.
*  We're going to move in with no law behind us, with no court ruling,
*  with no reasonable discourse.
*  We're going to move in with force and we're going to take over an air
*  with numbers and threats.
*  And then what's going to stop someone from doing that to you?
*  Nothing, you fuck.
*  You've already set a precedent.
*  You've already said this is how it's done.
*  And then it's just chaos and anarchy.
*  It just gets worse. Exactly.
*  And the more violent and larger group will win.
*  So from a the mission of counterinsurgency,
*  like how do you fight those ideas is stability and security. Right.
*  If we want to see positive change and, you know, kind of destitute
*  poverty stricken areas of the country, urban areas where like really
*  you want to talk about systemic racism, you start looking at like Detroit
*  and Baltimore and Chicago.
*  How do you fix that?
*  It's not fewer police officers, it's more police officers.
*  The way that you fix it is providing providing stability and security
*  in an area so that then businesses can flourish.
*  Capitalism arrives.
*  More job opportunities, more wealth, more education, more.
*  Like immediately in 10 years, you'll see the the transformation
*  of a block when a when a good business comes in and good things start happening.
*  That business can't go there if it's dangerous,
*  if it's writing and it's looting.
*  So if you look at every one of the cities that had serious riots
*  and, you know, from like Rodney King, how bad those areas still are.
*  It takes like 50, 60 years if they ever bounce back to come back from that.
*  So if you're like, you know, go black lives matter,
*  but then you're going in rioting, you are absolutely condemning yourself
*  to more poverty and then you go and defund the police and you remove
*  the one thing that's going to provide stability and security out in that area
*  that will bring in commerce, that will bring in business and jobs.
*  Like you're screwing yourself.
*  It's just so hard for people to see that because it's a long game.
*  And in the short term, they want justice and they're like, no justice, no peace.
*  And they just want to light shit on fire.
*  And I understand that they're angry and I understand that sentiment.
*  But no one's explaining that this is this is how this plays out.
*  You're literally going to fuck that area for a long time.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It takes a long and a lot of money is going to be
*  have to be spent in order to bring it back.
*  So the money is a hard thing.
*  Insurgencies are really cheap.
*  You know, if. If I want to ruin something,
*  you know, it doesn't take a lot of effort for me to destroy it,
*  for me to build and protect something that takes a lot of manpower
*  and manpower and hours.
*  Insurgencies are also way more successful than, you know, conventional type war,
*  even if it's just war of ideas that were in a civil war.
*  Thank God we don't have like geographic lines that these radical groups
*  could align themselves with, because then we'd be in a different problem.
*  It takes not just manpower funding,
*  you know, like if you're going to flood, say, Baltimore with police officers,
*  that's a lot of money.
*  And it would take a long time for a business to feel like it's safe
*  and secure for them to go in there and start affecting positive change,
*  opening more stores, more jobs, more jobs, more wealth, more wealth,
*  more education, more education, better schools.
*  And then, boom, we have a flourishing community where people can prosper.
*  But it takes, you know, one idiot with a Molotov cocktail
*  to bring that all crumbling down again.
*  Yeah. And you start from scratch or below scratch. Yeah.
*  Yeah. And that's where we are. Yeah.
*  I mean, this is a trying time for us in the weirdest of ways,
*  because I don't think anybody anticipated everything going this far south so quickly.
*  It's not done. Oh, this is yours.
*  What's that? Oh, my constitution. Mm hmm.
*  Back up, fuckers. Yeah.
*  I got the papers. Yeah.
*  Just how it is. It's not for interpretation.
*  It's just as it is. Just read the words.
*  Just amazing that these guys saw human nature
*  and how it could be fucked up and how they could ruin everything.
*  So far in advance.
*  Do you smoke cigars? I don't.
*  You don't at all.
*  No, I'm a pretty straight edge ish person.
*  Don't drink at all.
*  I'll have like a glass of wine every other night.
*  It's good for your blood. It's good for your heart.
*  Allegedly. That's what they say.
*  Yeah, that's the extent of it.
*  Yeah, but you know, those are like epidemiology studies.
*  Yeah, it's like how many people have a glass of wine every other night?
*  How are they doing? Yeah.
*  Look at them. It's not like they've proven a glass of wine does X or Y.
*  It also tastes really good with elk. Tastes good.
*  Yeah, I like it with steak.
*  Yeah, I'm a big fan of red meat and red wine.
*  It's a good combination.
*  That's the I have a big pretty liquor cabinet of nothing
*  that I ever drink that people just give me.
*  So when people come over, I'm like, yeah, you can.
*  No mushrooms, no psychedelics.
*  No, I've never done anything ever.
*  What? Nope.
*  That might be part of your problem.
*  I have lots of problems.
*  There's no doubt that that is on the long, dignified list of thought about it.
*  Thought about diving in.
*  And I have I have teenage daughters that, you know, ones of freshman in college,
*  ones of senior in high school.
*  And, you know, if I ever thought about it, it's good.
*  And then I have an 11 month old and a five year old.
*  So, dude, you do a lot of fucking. Yeah.
*  All of them will be through school before I ever thought about it.
*  I get it. My dad was a narcotics officer.
*  Oh, that's what it is.
*  And which was funny because I had like intentionally just to make him mad.
*  I had friends that were drug dealers, but I would never I would never use,
*  but I would be around it all the time.
*  That's interesting. How do you avoid it?
*  I've been an athlete, being a martial artist, being a fighter.
*  I was more into, you know, being able to beat somebody up than not.
*  What was your first martial art that you got into?
*  Karate. What kind? Shodokan.
*  And then I went to the Japanese Jiu Jitsu after that.
*  And Taika Ryo, Kya Jiu Jitsu.
*  And I did that for a while. And then I ended up at the pit.
*  Hawaiian Kempo with John Hacklman and Chuck.
*  San Luis Obispo. Yep.
*  Rory Grandi and San Luis Obispo.
*  Yeah. And then that's that my was actually Jake Shields.
*  That brought me to the pit. Really? Yeah.
*  He showed up. So I was like.
*  The big guy at the gym and grappling, right.
*  I wrestled and so I could go in and kind of smash a lot of the people.
*  And then this kind of awkward, weird white kid comes in and just like map
*  and like mops the floor with my soul.
*  And I was like, who are you?
*  Where did you come from?
*  And what did you do? Like, what is this?
*  He's like, well, it's it's like catch wrestling.
*  You know, it's kind of like Jiu Jitsu and wrestling kind of put together.
*  You know, and but you know, then we fight.
*  And I think I was 16 at this 15, 15, 16 at this time.
*  He's like, and we in San Luis Obispo, there's these other guys that do it.
*  This Gan McGee and Scott Adams and Chuck Liddell
*  and Antonio Banuelis, Cruz Gomez.
*  And I was like, cool, I want to go there.
*  So I went there and got my brains bashed in for forever.
*  Yeah, Hapkerman is an interesting character himself.
*  He is. He's quite a character.
*  Yeah, he's a great coach, though, especially back then.
*  He invested a lot and he was old school.
*  And I guys like Chuck and myself and we needed old school.
*  Now that coaches can't do or say the things that John would say back then.
*  And I love John now, but, you know, he was not a kind coach.
*  He's still training Glover, right?
*  Yeah. He's got glow.
*  And then Alex Pereira is with them now as well, which I thought was very interesting.
*  And Court McGee is still in and out.
*  Oh, is he? Yeah.
*  Court's had some injuries, right? Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I think his whole career has kind of been like that.
*  Yeah. That was a guy that was always on my radar.
*  Like, I thought I might fight because when I went to Jackson's,
*  you know, his clear break separation and then he's in the pit in Utah.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  He's got to stay healthy.
*  He's a he's one of those guys that almost died and came back because of drugs.
*  And there's a few of those guys that are almost unbreakable.
*  They like they they almost die and come back.
*  And then they become these insanely disciplined people.
*  And he's one of those. Yeah.
*  Is that good, though, to almost die from drugs?
*  I don't think it's good.
*  I think whatever led him to drugs, he probably could have squashed
*  those demons with training. Yeah.
*  But the problem with there's many obsessions
*  and addictions that come from almost the same energy
*  that could be applied to something that makes you incredibly successful.
*  It's these the way your brain is fixated,
*  whether it's on gambling or whatever it is, whatever these addictions are.
*  They could ruin your life or you could decide
*  you're going to be the baddest motherfucker that ever lived.
*  And it's the same kind of addictions.
*  You know, I've talked to Tyson about this.
*  I've talked to a bunch of fighters about this that have these addictive tendencies.
*  But those tendencies are also obsessive tendencies,
*  which can be applied to something that is ultimately positive like training.
*  That's what I do. Yeah.
*  I have a huge I've never had any addiction to negative stuff.
*  But I think if you looked at my life from how I train,
*  how I shoot, how I work, how I run my companies, you're like,
*  this this guy's a psychopath with the the disciplined regiment of
*  of literal pain and suffering that I intentionally put my body through.
*  And that's to stay productive.
*  And so it's all constructive. Yeah.
*  Like I always joke that if I didn't do martial arts and fight
*  and go to the military where all of those things were encouraged,
*  like, yeah, we want you to fight.
*  You know, we want you to kind of be a violent badass.
*  I would be in prison, you know, like for sure.
*  Probably a lot of people like that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  A lot of people, a lot of people that are in prison that I, to this day,
*  feel like we could have got them when they were young and said, hey, listen, listen,
*  this is the path you're on. Yeah.
*  But this is this is a way better path you can get on.
*  It's fucking exciting. Yeah. And it's going to feel good. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's painful. It's hard. So rewarding.
*  Yeah, so rewarding trying to talk, convince somebody like to buy into this way of life.
*  You know, and I think like, you know, hard work,
*  all the things that you want on the far side of hard work and.
*  Getting somebody to believe that where they have to make all these
*  kind of small decisions where am I waking up early?
*  Am I not going to be drinking? Am I not going to be doing drugs?
*  Am I going to be training?
*  Am I going to all of these tiny little decisions start adding up and
*  like the Titanic slowly turning the boat, you know,
*  but had they started turning the boat earlier, they wouldn't have struck an iceberg
*  and they all want to have died. Right.
*  But so you have to start making all these incremental adjustments.
*  And like, imagine what the Titanic would have been had it not struck the iceberg,
*  like a connection between two worlds, you know, the poverty,
*  being able to move to a new world and the rich elite being commingling.
*  And like, who knows what the world would have been like had that boat not sunk.
*  And it would have only taken these small early adjustments
*  to see the whole entire change of its course.
*  But the belief, right, you're at the helm and you're telling me
*  that to start moving to moving the boat.
*  And I'm like, I don't I don't want to be like, I don't need to.
*  All the excuses are there.
*  But it is so rewarding to be on the far side of all of that.
*  It's just people need to they need to know about these
*  procrastination demons that haunt your mind,
*  and they will rob you of all possible success of everything.
*  They'll steal everything from you. Yeah.
*  And when people come to our courses,
*  the biggest thing that we're trying to impart that like,
*  I'm not going in in two and a half days, I'm not going to turn somebody
*  into a great fighter.
*  I'm not going to turn somebody into a great shooter in two and a half days.
*  But what they're going to learn is they're going to learn their assets
*  and their liabilities, and they're going to learn about themselves about
*  what do they need to do that we're going to put them on a course,
*  a direction, a path, all the things they need to do to positively change their life.
*  And it becomes this this I'll use addictive like this all consuming passion
*  to want to know that your family safe to not live in fear,
*  to know that you're healthy.
*  You're like I have less body fat.
*  I'm feeling kind of like a badass.
*  I want to flirt with my wife a little bit more.
*  Now I'm having more sex. Now my energy is going up.
*  Now I'm sleeping better and the next day is even better.
*  So I can train a little bit more. I can work a little bit more.
*  I can shoot a little bit more.
*  And then like the next day I'm even better.
*  And like just 1% incremental changes.
*  Now two months removed.
*  You're like, who is this person?
*  You just lost 20 pounds of fat.
*  Like you've got calluses on your hands.
*  You don't have that fat baby chub on your face anymore.
*  And more importantly, I see life in your eyes
*  where you showed up two months ago and there's like this ghost skeleton of a human.
*  Now I see a person.
*  It's rad.
*  And I get to see this transformation of people.
*  It's one of the favorite things about what I do.
*  Yeah, it's so hard for people that don't do it to understand that
*  if you do push your body, it gets stronger and you grow.
*  And then you literally feel better.
*  I tried to explain it to a friend of mine.
*  I said, imagine if you have a race car
*  and the race car is 400 horsepower and a certain width tire
*  and a certain kind of suspension.
*  But literally you can make it have more horsepower and handle better.
*  And while all you have to do is work, you just have to push it.
*  And the tires will widen and the suspension will toughen
*  and it'll be more pliable around corners.
*  The engine will get stronger.
*  The exhaust will sound better.
*  It'll be more rewarding to drive.
*  You can do this. You can do with your body.
*  Like your body literally is like a race car.
*  Yes. And your mind. Your mind goes along with it,
*  which is another thing that bums me out.
*  We're really smart.
*  People don't want to work out because they think it's like
*  they think it's for meatheads or they think it's a stupid egotistical pursuit.
*  I'm like, no, you literally are all connected.
*  Your brain and your body are one total human condition.
*  Yes. Just because you look, if you're an awesome pianist, right,
*  and you're really good at playing the piano,
*  you have to understand that that's not just your fingers, right?
*  That's your mind.
*  Your mind is also making you play the piano.
*  Well, guess what? If you were in better cardiovascular shape,
*  you probably could do that even better because then the whole system would work better.
*  Everything would work better.
*  And this is the same with everything else is firing.
*  Yes, everything. Everything is going quicker.
*  You know, and guys like Rachmaninoff, big, huge, powerful hands
*  that could play these big, huge chords like his body conditioned to be able to do those things.
*  It wasn't like immediately he had this one and a half octave reach, right?
*  He learned and his hands literally grew to be able to play chords
*  that if you and I go and play them right now, we have carpals tunnel in six months.
*  You know, like his body adapted evolved to be able to play like this.
*  Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
*  Like that's so freaking cool.
*  I love humans. I love humans, too.
*  My friend Cam Haynes does a bunch of ultra marathon.
*  I love that guy. He's an awesome dude.
*  Yeah. And he started out like it's funny when I talk to him,
*  like when I started running, I could say, I better run a mile.
*  And that's so someone's saying, like, how the fuck does someone run 240 miles?
*  I go, we start by running a mile.
*  Yeah. How do you start eating an elephant?
*  Yeah. You start and you just you keep in the next thing, you know,
*  you can run three miles and you can do it at a comfortable pace.
*  And then six months later, you can run six miles at a comfortable pace.
*  And then six months after that, you can run a marathon at a comfortable pace.
*  And then six months after that, you can run an ultra marathon.
*  You've got to keep you said six months, though.
*  Like people want immediate early gratification, right?
*  Like how can I just hit a button or just watch an app
*  or pull up a YouTube video and teach me how to do that?
*  Yeah, because it takes work.
*  Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, it's a thing.
*  So how do you convince somebody to do it?
*  Because the this idea, this constitutional republic that we're in,
*  like it was possible because the individuals were strong, self-sufficient,
*  and they believed in individual responsibility.
*  Right. And they have fucking balls.
*  Yeah. To come to another huge, powerful.
*  I mean, I'm a fight a bear.
*  I start a republic, start a whole new thing.
*  Yeah, that's not possible.
*  No, without that individual being a freaking stud.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  And not this fat,
*  flagellant, gelatin human sitting on the couch playing video games.
*  And none of these ideas are possible
*  if we continue down the soft trajectory of wanting instant gratification
*  and believing that we're entitled to anything.
*  We have to we have to believe that you got to be a badass for this to work.
*  There's so many people that are conditioned to instant gratification,
*  and there's so many people that just want to take a pill.
*  That's that's that's another problem with today.
*  You know, you feel bad. You feel bad.
*  We need to take a pill or or go run four miles.
*  Yeah. Do what your brain does.
*  The same freaking thing that your pill just made you do,
*  but it happened naturally and you'll be healthier
*  and you're going to produce more of it tomorrow. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You know, like I don't know a lot of really depressed, frustrated,
*  sad, healthy, smart people who exercise a lot.
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, it's not.
*  I mean, I'm sure there's some I'm sure there are absolutely some mental imbalances,
*  just like some people have liver disease, right?
*  And they don't even drink.
*  Some people they get cancer and they didn't do anything wrong
*  because the body fucks up sometimes.
*  That also happens with your brain.
*  It happens with hormones.
*  It happens with your brain's ability to produce dopamine and serotonin.
*  Sometimes it just doesn't work right now.
*  And that is that is a real thing.
*  But more often than not, that's not what's going on.
*  Nope. Just go do the work. Just go do the work.
*  Yeah. It feels so good.
*  And everything like how much do you love eating your elk?
*  I love it. It's not only does it taste fantastic, right?
*  Not only do you look at it and remember every time I'm cooking,
*  whether like I had lasagna the other night, I took some
*  and the elk made Italian sausage, a little bit of pork fat.
*  A bunch of Italian oregano and thyme that were mixed into the meat.
*  So I made a lasagna with ground
*  backstrap and Italian sausage two nights ago.
*  But the like as I'm cooking and I'm remembering walking up this mountain
*  and seeing it two ridges away and be like, OK, where's the wind coming from?
*  How am I going to button hook around this thing so that I can stay up
*  wind of it and catch it in this next ravine?
*  You know, and like every single moment, the smells
*  and it's all coming back to you.
*  And I sit down at the table, got my family with me
*  and we're going to eat this together.
*  It's amazing. It's like magical.
*  It's hard for people to understand that I've never done it before.
*  But it is eating something that you have hunted and killed yourself
*  is a different thing.
*  It's a different thing. Really is.
*  Yeah. So fun, though.
*  In Texas, boy, what a good place to do it.
*  You can fucking do it anywhere here.
*  There's so many ranches here. It's so much like there's not a public land.
*  No. So it's going to be a little bit different.
*  Only two percent.
*  Yeah. Which is the whole state, which is kind of bonkers.
*  Yeah. But I mean, is the government really supposed to be owning our land?
*  Well, you just got all Texas on me. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Listen, I'm not opposed to owning property
*  and you can pay to hunt all these places.
*  And most of these places are a lot of them, I should say,
*  are commercial hunting ranches and they're not unreasonable.
*  And you can go and for a small amount of money
*  when you think about the amount of animal that you get.
*  I mean, if you hundreds of pounds.
*  Yeah. And especially pigs like you get some wild.
*  First of all, wild pigs. You've eaten wild pigs.
*  Yeah, I fucking love them.
*  I think they're goddamn delicious.
*  I love them. You got to get the right one.
*  You got to cut the right way.
*  Well, I've got I got lucky.
*  And the ones that I've hunted have been at Tajon Ranch in California
*  and they eat a lot of acorns.
*  Oh, wow. They were real thick with fat.
*  Oh, my God. So good.
*  I shot one with John Dudley and we brined it and slow cooked it on the Traeger.
*  It was incredible.
*  I love the Traeger. Oh, love it. So easy.
*  That's the thing. Yeah.
*  I had this walk in. I mean, it's
*  half the size of the studio, this walk in smoker.
*  And it had the heating element and the smoke element
*  and had it kind of like insulated.
*  It was like I could hang an entire rack of elk ribs in there.
*  But I had to sit there
*  24 seven for however long I was against there and smoke this.
*  And I just too much of a pain adjusting smoke levels and heat levels.
*  And and then it's like, oh, now I can just put this thing in my
*  and walk inside with my phone. It's going to check your text me.
*  Hey, add add some more stuff in here.
*  Yeah, I need more smoke.
*  And you're like, oh, my God, this is too easy.
*  Even better. I love when you do a recipe through the app.
*  The app actually navigates the cooking cycle and changes temperature for you.
*  But then at the end of the day, it's really just fire and wood.
*  That's the beautiful thing.
*  There's no chemicals.
*  There's no gas.
*  There's it's just fire and wood.
*  Yeah. So it tastes like you cooked it over an open fire.
*  So good. It's fucking awesome.
*  And wild game that way is the best.
*  Yeah, it's the best.
*  I mean, there's a reason why so many hunters buy triggers.
*  Pellet pellet grills, any pellet grill.
*  If you don't have a trigger, pellet grills are the shit.
*  They're so good.
*  Look, I love how easy it makes life.
*  You know, like my my outdoor cook kitchens next to the pool.
*  So I go throw that stuff in there and I'm like in the pool with the kids.
*  Yeah, mine too.
*  And it's just yeah, I'm not sitting over there, wasting my whole entire day.
*  And my kids are pissed.
*  You know, I'm like, you better appreciate this brisket
*  because I spent 14 hours on it.
*  You know, like that never happens.
*  Like I put it in there and I forgot about it.
*  Old school like when I watch the videos of Franklin's Franklin's barbecue in Austin,
*  that dude, he uses old school, you know, offset smokers with wood
*  and throws the wood in with the logs.
*  And obviously the result is fucking insanely delicious.
*  I appreciate it, but I don't have time for that.
*  But that's his full time job.
*  You know, Aaron Franklin, I got it.
*  That's amazing.
*  You keep doing that thing.
*  I'll drive in and buy it when I need it.
*  But I don't have the time to do that.
*  And I love looking at my app like, oh, the meat's at 120 degrees.
*  Get ready to pull it.
*  Yeah, we're getting close and sends you a little notification.
*  Yeah, no, I love it.
*  I love it.
*  And I can't get enough while game and I need to bring more out here.
*  I didn't bring enough out here.
*  I have I have it in commercial freezers, some of it back home.
*  So I literally might take a trip back home just to fill up some coolers
*  and bring meat back. It's crazy.
*  Shipping it with dry ice.
*  Well, if I just put it in a yeti.
*  Yeah. If it's frozen, it'll you could send it regular ground
*  mail for five days, it'll get there.
*  Fucking frozen.
*  That's it's crazy how well those things keep temperature.
*  I put on either end a little cardboard vertical separator from the meat.
*  And then I pack dry ice in there and I just leave like an inch along the top
*  if I'm shipping stuff.
*  And then it just keeps it, you know, super frozen for how long, how long will last?
*  And the dry ice, you know, evaporates at the same weather, regardless of temperature.
*  So inside there, that'll last four or five days.
*  Well, yeah. Yeah, it's it could be done.
*  You could ship it. What are you guys doing tomorrow?
*  Nine eleven.
*  Well, the reason why I had you on here today is because this podcast
*  can be released on nine eleven.
*  I think there's no more appropriate person to have on nine eleven than you.
*  We have a podcast tomorrow that we're doing a Skype one with a fellow from the UK.
*  The there are way more appropriate people than me.
*  Like any firefighter that was there at ground zero.
*  Have you been to ground zero? No.
*  Man, you got to go.
*  Every American.
*  I think New York City is off my list for life now.
*  Yes. That's a good point.
*  But being there and seeing kidding, by the way, if you live in New York, relax.
*  I'm coming back.
*  Oh, they do a ton of comedy there.
*  Yeah, they're still doing comedy there.
*  You have to do it outside, though, in a fucking tent.
*  Yeah. But don't people come by with microphones and scream at you?
*  Yeah, that's comedy, too.
*  I had John Hackelman and I talked this week.
*  He called me. He's like, hey, what would you do if you're at a restaurant
*  and you know, you're essentially ambushed by people screaming at you,
*  trying, you know, telling you to raise your face, raise your fist
*  and like, you know, one, I'll not be there because I before I go places,
*  I'm making sure that it's safer to go there.
*  You know, I'm not going to be sitting at a restaurant
*  where a protest is going to be walking through.
*  And I know they're targeting ones specifically to try to catch people
*  and get the I got you moment.
*  Two is like, you know, situational awareness.
*  It's not I'm sitting here and I see some people congregating across the street.
*  I'm going to wait and see what happens.
*  Now, there's a lot of people I see cameras, I see megaphone.
*  Something can still sit here and wait and see what happens.
*  I got to see like five, six people wearing black hoodies, masks,
*  you know, little red fists painted on their shoulders.
*  I'm like, dinner's done. We're out of here.
*  We pack up and go.
*  Yes, New York, crazy, crazy place.
*  But that that memorial is I don't know what it is about that place.
*  Like you can feel.
*  I don't know, souls,
*  like you can feel the pain there.
*  I think that's real. I think you can.
*  My dad went to Gettysburg and my stepfather and he was there and he said,
*  I've never believed that there's a place we could feel sadness.
*  He goes, but you just feel the people that died there.
*  Yeah, feel it.
*  I mean, palatable, describable heaviness.
*  Yeah. And this is not like I'm not like I'm not a guy that,
*  you know, like the crystals.
*  No, but you can feel it.
*  And, you know, never forget, right?
*  How quickly we forgot.
*  Well, they were trying to cancel the fucking putting up the lights.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Like why?
*  Why would you do that?
*  Have you seen the Falling Man documentary? No.
*  So there's a photograph called The Falling Man
*  that it is.
*  You can just Google Falling Man and you see
*  this guy and this anytime I need to know the reason
*  why I'm going all over these places doing that.
*  That dude.
*  Oh, fuck. I can't look at it because it like I mean, it gets me
*  because I just talk about this dude for a second.
*  He's sitting standing,
*  kneeling, laying on the floor of a shattered window.
*  And he's looking back inside and he's making a decision
*  whether he's going to burn alive or he's going to jump to his death.
*  Him and hundreds of others.
*  They're sitting there, Americans looking inside of a building,
*  being like, OK, do I burn alive
*  or do I jump to my death?
*  And that that that video and that picture is so unnerving
*  because he consciously is making the choice to die the whole entire way down.
*  You can see he's staying in like I'm going to face plant into the asphalt
*  and all the way into the ground.
*  He's making that choice because he didn't want to burn alive.
*  So like every time I'm sucking or suffering or frustrated,
*  if I had to go, you know, do another mission that I'm of course,
*  I want to do all these sexy things all over the planet.
*  And but sometimes I don't get to get usually that's the way the military works.
*  Don't get to pick. And
*  I think about that guy and I think about the three thousand Americans
*  that were standing there and be faced with that choice of
*  am I going to burn alive or am I going to jump to my death?
*  Because insurgents.
*  Wanting to, you know, radical fundamentals, wanted to
*  destroy the idea that we stood for capitalism, American freedom,
*  you know, with five hundred thousand dollars in box cutters,
*  these untrained assholes were able to bring down
*  the largest superpower on the planet.
*  Like that's what asymmetrical warfare is like asymmetrical is
*  is something that's not aligned with everything else.
*  And warfare in these
*  under asymmetrical warfare is kind of the haves, not fighting the haves
*  and doing it in ways that nobody's ever done it before.
*  It was it was genius and horrible that this small group of untrained guys
*  with box cutters did.
*  How many trillions of dollars have we spent in this war?
*  Seventeen billion dollars in damage just in that one day.
*  Three thousand American lives more lives since Pearl Harbor.
*  You know, like we went to war with the Japanese and dropped
*  two atomic bombs for that.
*  We're so short.
*  With what we remember.
*  This this current society, this generation, this fast influx of information
*  like I want to never forget that man's face.
*  And do we know who he was? Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, they think they're like 90 percent.
*  There was another couple that did it as well.
*  Oh, no, there there there was like a few dozen.
*  Yeah, I got the black girl on the right.
*  Or maybe she's white and covered in soot.
*  But she's literally looking down, trying to get a breath,
*  a fresh breath of air before she either suffocates or burns alive.
*  And then she jumps.
*  I never again, we say never forget, you know, never again.
*  Like, how do we stop that?
*  And that is the constant.
*  Unrelenting fight against these fanatic ideas, and it's not just
*  there are countless types of of revolutionaries and insurgents,
*  ones that do it for religious reasons, ones to push out foreign powers,
*  ones because of the the the.
*  Who to see like that's just ethnic,
*  but they're all the same kind of formula of we're not happy about something.
*  So we're going to do something horrific to try and change asymmetrical warfare
*  to try to change the shape of something.
*  And that fight against this, these extreme outliers
*  has to be one that we're committed to all the time.
*  Otherwise, that will happen again.
*  Right. It might be a train.
*  It might be a bus.
*  You know, it might be a dirty bomb.
*  You know, thank God, Boston, probably the next worst thing
*  that's happened since then, which was a couple of idiots with pressure cookers
*  because we have been so aggressive, not just here, but also abroad,
*  ensuring that this doesn't happen.
*  It's weird right now.
*  You know, I think the last time I was here, I was telling you
*  how bad it is in special operations and special forces,
*  specifically in recruiting, like we are hurting for people and the right people.
*  And all the people that have been coming in, they came in to fight this war.
*  But now we have kids in basic training that weren't alive when 9-11 happened.
*  I volunteered on 9-11 because of this, but now we have.
*  I don't even know how many I'm calling them kids, they're heroes that they're
*  they're selflessly serving their country.
*  But we're leaving Iraq.
*  We're leaving Afghanistan.
*  I had a deployment next year that looks like it's going to get canked
*  because Trump is pulling back our forces from these places for us to do other things.
*  And those other things are.
*  Counterinsurgency, it's foreign internal defense,
*  it's security forces assistance, it's joint combined exercises for training.
*  And like while I want to go put on my body armor and have a beard
*  and go look sexy and go do all these things,
*  those are the important jobs that we have to do in the coming in the coming years
*  to make sure this doesn't happen again.
*  Right. If we're in Afghanistan in 1999
*  with a president trying to help the Afghani government
*  have a constitutional republic or a government in a way,
*  what if this happened?
*  Maybe not. I don't know, but probably not.
*  It's the same reason why we're all over Africa.
*  Same reason why we still have presence in NATO.
*  It's the same reason that we're we're present in the Philippines.
*  It's trying to fight these radical ideas so that security and stability
*  provides an area for people to live freely.
*  However they want to.
*  We're not telling anybody how to live, right.
*  Philippines, Africa, Niger, Nigeria,
*  Mortania, Burkina Faso, you guys do your things.
*  Whatever that thing is, we're here to help you do it.
*  But it's going to be done safely to provide stability and security.
*  So I never want to see that again.
*  Like, do you want to see it in America?
*  I mean, like I'm not going to see my kids,
*  but I want to burn alive.
*  So I'm going to jump.
*  Fuck you and your extremist ideas, I'm going to find you
*  and we're going to fight you till the day we die.
*  But we have to be vigilant about it.
*  When you hear people talk about defunding the military,
*  when you hear people talk about pulling troops out of other countries
*  and a non interventionalist foreign policy,
*  but you know what you know,
*  and you know why this stuff has to be done.
*  How do you react to that?
*  It's ignorance.
*  I mean, first, it's pity.
*  It's like I feel bad for them.
*  You know, I'll go to a country in West Africa
*  and I'll go back two years later and I will see the school that I helped build
*  or was providing training for the people that are going to be protecting it.
*  And that school is still functioning.
*  And they've had two years of people graduating from that school.
*  And now I go to what was like this podunk village
*  and people are sitting there reading a book like you can read.
*  Like, yeah, I learned how to read last year.
*  What? This is so cool.
*  You know, like you have fresh water.
*  How did you have fresh water?
*  Like, well, we learned how to read.
*  And then we started reading these books and like we actually do
*  natural filtration through the soil.
*  And we're also doing this tiered irrigation.
*  Like, check out our crops.
*  Holy crap. You have crops here.
*  You didn't have crops here two years ago.
*  Like in in two years, in two years,
*  I'm seeing this transformation of people.
*  So every single radical group from ISIS, Al Qaeda, Taliban,
*  FARC to Antifa,
*  they go and target the poor and the uneducated.
*  That's that's who they recruit from.
*  And they take these ideas.
*  They plant seeds and they plant seeds through
*  like you're super poor.
*  Your daughter's going to get married.
*  I'm going to come in as the bad guy, as the ISIS member,
*  and I'm going to pay for your daughter's wedding
*  and and the endowment.
*  I'm going to do it all.
*  And now like you're indebted to me and your wife and her new husband
*  are kind of like appreciative to me.
*  But now I have a hook in you and I can.
*  And it doesn't take a lot of money to pay for a wedding in.
*  Somalia.
*  So there's the population,
*  there's the poverty, and there's the opportunity for them to plant
*  these seeds of fanatic.
*  Ridiculousness, and that's that's what they do.
*  So when I see somebody that's like, hey, we need to pull everybody back.
*  Yeah, in.
*  In wars, Iraq and Afghanistan,
*  we we have created stability there, and I don't know.
*  Well, we can never govern Afghanistan like they can't be.
*  That's just the way that the people are.
*  And it's kind of cool and it's kind of.
*  Also frightening because they're so nomadic.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's been tribal forever.
*  I mean, you go back to gang is calling, you know, like they've been insurgents
*  from Khan to to the British, to the Russians,
*  to then the British again, to the French, to then the Russians again, then to us.
*  Like they've just been doing this thing for as long as they've been in existence.
*  So.
*  Just leave them be, right?
*  We can still be there with the government, like hand in hand,
*  advise and assist and accompany like how to do things.
*  But we don't physically need to be there fighting wars all the time.
*  And that's kind of what we're doing, right?
*  We're phasing back our physical direct action presence.
*  But it's somebody saying that we need to pull everybody in.
*  We only need to protect our own borders and let's just be present here.
*  It's super naive and it's super ignorant
*  because this is the result of us not being outside of our own borders.
*  The idea of policing the world doesn't sit well with people, though.
*  We don't have to place the idea the world.
*  That's not what we're doing.
*  So security forces, assistance or joint combined exercise
*  for training or for internal defense, that is I am not walking around being like,
*  hey, you insurgent, you get back in that building.
*  I'm with like by with and through working with the local government
*  by their side, with them, with their mission and their intent
*  through their own purpose and ideas.
*  I understand that.
*  But how do you get that message to people that do think that it's policing
*  the world, that do think that we should mind our own business
*  and take that Ron Paul approach and pull the troops back and take care of our own
*  and not worry about other countries?
*  I mean, I wish I could take people with me to show them.
*  Have you ever listened to Ron Paul talk about these?
*  Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
*  I think the easy answer, and I never like easy answers,
*  is that this hasn't happened.
*  9-11 hasn't happened again, even though they have.
*  We know that they have tried.
*  10, 20, 30 thousand times, they've tried to do this again in every single way.
*  And whether it's a terrorist training camp
*  where we got them, whether it's the new ISIS leader,
*  whether it's the new al-Qaeda leader, whether it's the next Iranian
*  you know, secret service that's funding groups
*  and terrorist organizations all over the planet.
*  We got him, you know, like
*  we have been constant and vigilant in finding them and stopping them.
*  And we have to otherwise.
*  But how is how is this not happened again?
*  Are there fewer extremists? No.
*  We have stopped them through our actions.
*  If we did not do anything, this would happen again.
*  How much of an effect does it have in whose president?
*  Oh, man, a lot.
*  Like, what was the difference between Obama and Trump?
*  I'll just use ammo as an example.
*  It's a soup, like again, not an easy.
*  I'm just trying to draw, you know, parallels.
*  That people can wrap their heads around.
*  That people can wrap their heads around.
*  If I'm going to forecast how much ammo I need for training,
*  I'm going to find out what my mission is.
*  I'm going to set up kind of like the training calendar
*  of all the events that we're going to do.
*  Flat ranges, CQB, long distance sniper stuff, mounted training.
*  And then that forecasts how much ammo I need.
*  And then I go and I ask for that ammo.
*  And I would get like.
*  I'd be allowed to ask for about a third
*  then during Obama of what I was allowed to ask for with Bush or now Trump.
*  A third, a third.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  And is there rationalization for that?
*  It's just like a funding
*  like us being able to buy cool drones or new guns or different optics.
*  Like the funding is there or the funding is not there.
*  And if like while the big department defense military machine
*  may not be the most efficient thing, when it goes down to the individual,
*  like it comes down to me being like, I can have this gun or I can't.
*  I can have this optic or I can't.
*  I have to use this old rifle that's been shot by 20 soldiers before me.
*  Or I get a new one.
*  And and it's it's it's black and white.
*  It's like dollars and cents.
*  Like I have nine dollars under this guy or I have three dollars under this guy.
*  So when you left fighting and went back into the military
*  was one of the reasons you did that because Trump was in office
*  and then there was more funding.
*  Yes. I don't like losing at anything
*  and going into a fight that you are not prepared
*  to win is a pretty bad idea.
*  And knowing.
*  You like I use Kelvin Gesslem as an example, supposed to fight
*  Rashad Evans at New Year's Eve or at Madison Square Gardens in November
*  and fight fell through medical things.
*  And I mean, by the time I get to the Kelvin Gesslem, I've cut my
*  I've cut weight two different times.
*  Now my ballooned up to 220 back down to 185, 220.
*  Now I'm cutting weight back to 185 again.
*  And now a five month fight camp.
*  I'm like walking out to the octagon tired.
*  Like I just warmed up in the back with Brandon and Greg and I'm like,
*  that's a really trained.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's a bad feeling to walk into a fight.
*  Not in a position to fight.
*  And we're when when Trump was elected, we were 100% still at war.
*  ISIS was thriving.
*  Right.
*  All the places that I went and fought in the war.
*  Right.
*  All the places that I went and fought in Afghanistan were now controlled by ISIS.
*  Like, do you know bad that sucks to look at all the places where I remember
*  friends getting hurt or, you know, like Jaco, the places that he went, but those
*  were occupied by ISIS physically occupied and he lost countless friends.
*  Fallujah, Ramadi, solder city, all of those places, all of them in Syrian
*  border controlled by ISIS land that we controlled and fought and then lost.
*  And then thinking about like, I have to go back in here and do this again.
*  But I have the third, a third amount of the resources to do it.
*  That sucks.
*  Or knowing that, okay, now I'm going to have a guy that is going to back me with
*  the pocketbook to go and win that.
*  That was the choice for me was I just want to win.
*  I don't want nine 11 to happen again.
*  And that's hard to stop when you're giving, when you're creating
*  vacuums for evil to fill.
*  And how much of an impact has it have, has it had having Trump as president and
*  making those decisions to fund the military better in terms of success overseas?
*  I mean, we smashed ISIS in a year, one year they rose for three and, and started
*  gaining ground, the ISIS Caliphate into all of the middle East.
*  Like they were popping up.
*  We had ice people swearing allegiance to ISIS in Africa.
*  You know, like the Boko Haram was like, yeah, we're ISIS now.
*  Like, what are you kidding me?
*  And that cancerous plague spreading all over the world because we weren't
*  aggressively with vigilance fighting those ideas then, um, you know, November
*  roll around 2016 and it was by at February of 2017, it was like go and it was off.
*  You know, we're literally smashing them at every single opportunity, dropping
*  the biggest bomb, you know, in Taliban, the JDM or the, was it the Moab?
*  Yeah.
*  That's pretty cool.
*  I just dropped the, you know, the bomb next to the size of the nuclear weapon.
*  That's awesome.
*  And this is all because of Trump getting into office and funding the military.
*  Yeah.
*  So the president comes out with this, um, national strategic plan, and that goes to
*  a bunch of different things from department of defense to department of
*  state and every single one of these.
*  Look to that idea, that document as to how they're going to operate.
*  And then you have the appointees to those positions like Mattis, for example,
*  where then he interprets what the intent is from like the executive plan.
*  And then for department of fence, how are we going to fulfill that?
*  And then that goes to all of the regional commanders and to all the special
*  operations units, and then missions are built off of fulfilling these ideas.
*  And those ideas were smash ISIS, remove radical terrorists off the planet and
*  provide security and stability with all of our partners and then grow who our
*  partners are.
*  So like in Africa, if you went back five, six years, you would have three or four,
*  five countries that were part of this, like this group of regional Africans wanting
*  to be free, right?
*  Like they don't want Boko Haram or Al Qaeda or ISIS coming in and telling them
*  what to do.
*  They want a free constitutional government.
*  So we started helping.
*  Now there's like a dozen of those countries that are part of this group and
*  they're all doing, they're all doing the work.
*  And it's amazing.
*  It's amazing to see what happens in just a couple of years in any one of these
*  countries when they start doing the work.
*  It's no different than a person, right?
*  It's like, but it's a group of people and they're all believing in these ideas of
*  freedom, of education, of prosperity.
*  And we're just creating an opportunity for those to be realized.
*  This is not a message that gets out enough.
*  What you're saying right now about the importance of funding the military, about
*  all the positive aspects of these operations and about how squashing these
*  fundamentalist terrorist groups can lead to democracy in all these places and can
*  lead to flourishing schools and growth of these individual areas.
*  Yeah.
*  This is not a message that gets out enough.
*  No, I mean, and that's by design a little bit.
*  I think.
*  You know, half the country doesn't want the other half to look good.
*  And we definitely know that our, all of our enemies, foreign enemies are 100%
*  participating right now as you move towards November in delegitimizing what this
*  country stands for in the process of our elections and what we're allowed to do
*  successfully overseas.
*  So like, you know, from Russia to China, like they are.
*  In the business of hurting America, and they're not only here, like making our
*  election seem unfair or broken, but also abroad where they're, they're trying to,
*  like every place that we are, they are as well.
*  And they're trying to do the opposite of what we like.
*  They're there.
*  They want radicals.
*  They want broken.
*  They want.
*  Because every little bit that they do is more that we have to fight against.
*  When I said that an insurgency is cheap and a counter-insurgency is expensive,
*  but we're fighting counter-insurgency over the planet.
*  As we move towards the elections with Portland firing off Seattle, firing off,
*  like I think it'd be very naive for us not to think that China and Russia are
*  negatively affected by the pandemic.
*  If you look at 2016 with Hillary and Trump, were the Russians involved?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like for sure.
*  They're, they're stoking the fires of hate on both sides and it didn't matter
*  who won.
*  Like they didn't want Trump to win.
*  They didn't need Hillary to win.
*  They just need the process to look broken.
*  They just have to make us look bad.
*  It doesn't matter to them who wins and coming to Biden and Trump.
*  It doesn't matter who wins.
*  It matters that they do legitimize the process of a fair election and a
*  constitutional Republic.
*  It's really easy to do.
*  I'm going to use, all right, you have a birthday coming up.
*  You are going to turn 60.
*  Happy birthday.
*  You look great for being 60 Joe.
*  And you're going to have a party to celebrate this.
*  And you're going to have a party to celebrate this.
*  And you're going to have a party to celebrate this.
*  And you're going to have all your friends over, you know, you got some gay
*  guys, you got some black guys, you got some Mexicans, you got, you're a pretty
*  balanced person with lots of different friends from lots of different cultures.
*  Not, but they're all going to be in the same room, right?
*  Got this big, huge melting pot of your party.
*  Cool.
*  It's going to be a rad party.
*  You got a bar.
*  You kind of rented this cool place.
*  It has a, you know, some few bathrooms has this nice, nice balcony, this
*  beautiful statue.
*  And there's like this ice sculpture.
*  That's that's some great drinks on it.
*  And the punches underneath it.
*  I don't want you to have a good party.
*  I'm I'm your insurgent.
*  I don't like you.
*  I don't like your ideas.
*  I don't like this idea of everybody being able to co-mingle.
*  So I'm going to go and I'm going to ruin your party.
*  I had a friend of a friend that kind of got me in.
*  So how hard is it for me to ruin your party?
*  Super easy, right?
*  I could go piss in the punch.
*  I could go find that gay guy.
*  Use some homophobic slurs.
*  You could find that Muslim over in the corner and, um, you know, tell him that
*  like the PLO is the dumbest group on the planet, you know, that Israel should
*  own everything and that, you know, Muslims are ignorant, um, uh, multi-wife
*  assholes, all of it's untrue.
*  It doesn't matter if I believe it.
*  I'm just there to piss people off.
*  I'm going to go to those two bathrooms.
*  I'm going to go give you an upper decker.
*  I'm going to go poop in the top of two of those toilets.
*  I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  I'm going to go poop in the top of two of those toilets.
*  Ooh, that's disgusting, right?
*  It stinks.
*  Maybe I'm going to go chip away at the, that little beautiful sculpture.
*  So when somebody goes to scoop the, their first punch, the whole thing
*  topple topples over so easy and so cheap for me to ruin everything about your day.
*  That's what they're trying to do in an election, right?
*  They're just trying to erode the process and ruin it.
*  And it costs them nothing to go and piss off every single group, the far right,
*  the far left, they just want people angry.
*  And the process is so simple.
*  Now with Twitter and Instagram and Facebook, right?
*  These set up these, these massive bots that can go and like things and create.
*  And they play this long game where they just start planting seeds of distrust
*  and, and they are spending money to make Antifa mad.
*  They're spending money to make the Boogaloo bros look mad.
*  And they want everybody to be mad at everybody moving into November.
*  So then the process, the election is jacked, but your party.
*  So you do have an option.
*  This is the catch 22 of how difficult it is as a leader to stop it.
*  Like I could hire security guards.
*  I could put a guard at the front.
*  I could have put a guard by the punch.
*  I could put a guard in every bathroom.
*  I could check all the IDs of everybody coming in.
*  I could have like a exact list of people that are allowed to attend.
*  Um, but now I just ruined you just ruined your own party because you're trying to
*  provide security and stability and you put all of that in there and, but now
*  your party sucks, right?
*  Like I can't get a drink.
*  I'm only allowed one drink and nobody's allowed to talk to each other.
*  And nobody's allowed to hang out.
*  Everybody has to be segregated and separate.
*  So you ruined your own party.
*  So in either case, you give me freedom of movement, the American way,
*  and I'm going to ruin it.
*  Or you try to come in too heavy handed and then you look like a dictator.
*  You know, you'll, you'll look like Hitler himself.
*  So how do you, how, how do you have a good party?
*  It's hard.
*  That's where we're at right now.
*  They're literally doing that with, with every way they can.
*  It's frightening.
*  So this idea that Russia just wants Trump to win it's horseshit.
*  Yeah, they don't care.
*  They just need the process to look bad.
*  So wait, we have a constitutional Republic, right?
*  What do they have?
*  But dictatorship, absolutely.
*  So they don't need a friend.
*  They just need the process, the idea of America to look broken.
*  That's what that's success to them.
*  If I, like, I can say this with such absolute conviction, because this is
*  what we do, this is what we do.
*  This is what we go overseas and do.
*  Like we have specific groups that are doing this exact thing to make them
*  look bad, but they're doing it to us.
*  And because America is so free, it's so much easier to do here.
*  Like how hard is it for me to go to Russia and, or land in China and go and
*  start planting seeds of discontent.
*  It's pretty freaking hard, right?
*  Like here it's not so hard to fight this.
*  So because of the fact that we have freedom and because of the fact that we
*  have these democratic elections, we have to fight this.
*  And so we have these elections because of the fact that we have the ability to
*  express ourselves and communicate freely online, which they don't really have in
*  either one of those countries.
*  I mean, there's severe repercussions for criticizing the government in China.
*  Severe.
*  And same thing about Russia.
*  So because we have this freedom over here, they participate.
*  And the way they participate is through the internet research agency.
*  And I had a woman on, uh, named Renee DeRestas, who extensively researched this
*  and how spectacular this operation was and what they would do.
*  Like they literally organized a pro Texas meetup across the street from a pro
*  Muslim meetup.
*  And they set it up.
*  They set it up that way.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, a friend who's, um, uh, very well versed online found this, uh, Antifa,
*  uh, rage, uh, this thing against white rage online and they, they traced the
*  IP back to Russia.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're like, this is wild.
*  This is wild shit.
*  Like they're doing this.
*  It's not wild though.
*  America woke up your eyes because it wake up and open your eyes to this is
*  happening where how naive is it for us not to think that our enemies are trying
*  to negatively affect what is happening here.
*  Right.
*  Because this is the place where you can negatively affect it in the way that
*  they can do it here, which is different than the way you could affect anything
*  in Russia or China because of the fact that we have this freedom of expression.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't, they don't need somebody to win.
*  They just have to make us look bad.
*  This is where our media has failed us because our media takes this
*  horrible partisan position, whether you're on the left or the right.
*  They, they only want to look at the things that show that the left or the
*  right, depending on who your enemy is, is fucking up and how China or Russia,
*  whoever, whoever you deem the player, that's the key player is influencing
*  our elections because they want this person to win.
*  So if you love America, you will vote against Trump because the
*  Russians want Trump to win.
*  And this is, this is the fucking narrative that keeps getting spit out at us.
*  And it's not, it doesn't sit well with me.
*  And I'm glad you're explaining it the way you're explaining it because
*  partisanship and this, this ability, inability to look at things objectively
*  is really fucking us up.
*  Yeah.
*  It's really bad.
*  And these motherfuckers that are running the media, there's a reason why people
*  aren't paying attention anymore.
*  There's a reason.
*  There's a reason why those, those sources are not trusted.
*  I mean, divided is perfectly divided.
*  Like if, if, if I, if I were in China or in Moscow, I was like, exactly what kind
*  of environment do I want so I could negatively affect an election, you're
*  looking at it, right?
*  I'm going to stoke the fires of the 1% on the right.
*  I'm going to stoke the fires of the 1% on the left.
*  And I'm just going to, I want them so angry.
*  I've created all these different accounts that have thousands of followers.
*  They're fake.
*  The followers are bots and the people that are saying that those are real
*  people that speak perfect English and they are in there in those groups, just
*  planting hate so that people can just get madder and madder and madder.
*  You know, we look at like black lives matter.
*  I don't think there's a single American that that's going to be like, no,
*  black lives don't matter.
*  Well, there might be one, but screw that racist, right?
*  So few and so irrelevant.
*  It's such a minor position.
*  Yeah.
*  And like, like the, is there solidarity for sure?
*  Like are the solutions, the things being talked about?
*  Not really.
*  Not really.
*  Why is that?
*  Like I'm spending probably half of my waking hours right now, developing a way
*  to be able to train police officers and get something into every single police
*  department so they can like, you know, unconscious bias, um, training about how
*  to deescalate, understanding different cultures, right?
*  If I'm walking down the street and I see a key seek and I'm like, Oh,
*  is this a Muslim?
*  I've got to go here and fight this guy.
*  The guy comes in a little bit close because that's part of their culture.
*  And it's also part of their culture that they have a knife.
*  And, um, but I don't know any of this and I just misunderstood who this person is
*  and his religion and his ethnicity.
*  And now I have this super bad interaction because this guy stepped into my space
*  and all that could have been trained out.
*  I could have taught somebody those things.
*  And with everybody being so stoked on getting angry and finding out the
*  problems, nobody's talking about solutions.
*  Like, how do we, how do we, if there's a problem in law enforcement and there is,
*  like, how do we fix that?
*  Can we talk about that instead of, of trying to find the next poor Uber driver
*  that gets lost and immediately calling him a racist or finding the next Antifa
*  guy that, um, is really just poor, lost his job, has been living in his
*  mom's basement and just needs something to do.
*  And let's give them something to do.
*  And that's like, make a positive impact.
*  That is a real part of what's going on too.
*  It's a real part of what's going on is people don't feel like they belong.
*  And when there's a movement going on, if you jump on that, you, you see
*  the, any of that guy who, uh, shot the, uh, pro Trump supporter in Portland.
*  Yeah.
*  And you see the interview with him afterwards.
*  Yeah.
*  The interview is classic.
*  You listen to him interviewed him.
*  He's a lost guy, a lost, weird social outcast who found a home and then is
*  soaking up all this attention that he got for shooting a Trump supporter.
*  He's claiming was out there trying to kill a friend of his of color.
*  Like this is his description of it.
*  And then the police show up and he tries to shoot them.
*  Yeah.
*  He's just a lost person.
*  Yeah.
*  A violent lost person.
*  I mean, as somebody with a lot with no purpose is a dangerous thing.
*  Especially one who doesn't understand the consequences of their actions.
*  It
*  my, my brother's a sheriff, Nick in, uh, in California.
*  And, um, the things that he has to do in a day, you know, the number of people
*  in interactions that he has to have that he has had in his career and every single
*  time.
*  Is it going to be this Antifa guy that just shot somebody, um, in Monterey,
*  there, there was actually some Antifa guys that had thrown some pipe bombs in
*  Oakland and then drove into, um, Northern Monterey County and, um, set off some
*  more pipe bombs, shot a couple more cops.
*  And this kind of got buried in the news.
*  Uh, but like my brother was one of the guys that showed up there and they have
*  to deal with that, like a radical domestic terrorist.
*  And they also have to show up when a husband and wife are having a dispute.
*  Um, they have to walk up to every single car as if that person's going to kill
*  them, that person might be a DUI.
*  That person may not want to, if they have broken the law, um, not want to get out
*  of the car, like you're going to make them get out of the car.
*  Like it is the hardest job in the world.
*  They're under trained, they're underfunded and, but they are the necessary
*  security for us to prosper and be successful.
*  And my brother's the most selfless, incredible person as, as most of the guys.
*  And I train with a ton of law enforcement and nobody, they're not perfect.
*  Nobody is no human is.
*  Um, but you can, you can't train perfection, but you can train bad out of people.
*  And that's one of the many reasons why I think training is so paramount.
*  And, you know, to the election and people are always focusing on the bad, like
*  you've got to find solutions.
*  If you're, if you're mad and you believe in black lives matter, what is your
*  solution, right?
*  If you're, if you think that cops have a problem, like I'm trying to find, like
*  I've found a solution, right?
*  We're, we're creating this, this, uh, virtual reality headset that we're going
*  to be able to put into every single police department where they'll be able to
*  listen to, um, and interact with different ethnicities that, that are consistent
*  with the populations that they work in.
*  Um, you know, like be able to identify unconscious bias.
*  Like I'm pretty aware of the biases that I have because I look through the lens
*  of my life through pretty jaded glasses, right?
*  The things that I've gone and done and seen.
*  Um, but there's no way that I'm aware of all of them, but there are ways that you
*  could train that out of people and that you can show them and explore, uh, we have
*  like some of the best brightest minds, PhDs, um, law enforcement trainers that
*  are designing these things that we can like put, um, specular theories, my
*  partner in this, like we can take these things and send to every single law
*  enforcement, law enforcement department and train people about how to interact.
*  And when you're a hammer and everything looks like a nail and you're going to
*  all of these different interactions with like, is this guy going to shoot me?
*  It's hard because he might, but he also might just be having a bad day and needing
*  to how to deescalate that.
*  And, um, but you also have to be able to enforce the law.
*  And that's the one of the hardest things right now.
*  And I know the Chinese and the Russians are loving the fact that we are questioning.
*  Do laws really matter?
*  Can we just let things go?
*  Can we just tear down statues?
*  Can you just walk out into the middle of an interstate and stop traffic because you
*  believe you have the right to do that?
*  No, you can't do that.
*  Like the re rule of law is there not just for you, but it's for us.
*  And if you believe in the collective, then you have to believe that those laws are
*  there for our good.
*  And we have to make sure we elect good guys that put in good laws.
*  But like, if you just don't believe that it matters and you can go and you can
*  riot and you can loot and it's just property, like you can burn that building
*  down, it's just property lives are more important than property, but there are
*  people's lives that are attached to that property.
*  It might be how they make their money.
*  It might be where they live.
*  Like watching an Tifa throw those Molotov cocktails while there were kids sleeping
*  upstairs in the apartment building, like shame on you.
*  You're being played right now.
*  Not only that, but what you said earlier, if you do destroy that property,
*  understand the lives that are going to be affected because that community is
*  going to be entrenched in poverty for generations.
*  Yeah.
*  You're not doing good.
*  You're harming.
*  Stop harming, you know, start doing good.
*  Fine.
*  Fine.
*  Like as we're on nine 11, the time, maybe the last time that we were united as a
*  country where we're like, no, never again.
*  Like we can do that now.
*  We really can.
*  I believe in the American spirit, but like they, this petty.
*  Immature.
*  Hate that people have against other people, but they're not other people.
*  They're other Americans that believe in the same thing as you.
*  And that want the same thing as you.
*  They might have a different way of going about it and getting there and
*  perspective, but like we're, we all bleed red, you know, we all believe in the
*  same thing, we all want the same thing.
*  And just finding out how to get there.
*  I wonder what can be done to decouple us from the influence of social media in
*  terms of like, there's no way you could stop as of right now, there's no way you
*  could stop trolls.
*  There's no way you can stop things like the internet research agency in Russia
*  or all these different online groups that are just completely created just to
*  fuck with people.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no way we could stop that now.
*  Nope.
*  If we could, we'd be better for it.
*  Yes, we'd be better for it.
*  If we could, we'd be better for it.
*  Yes, we'd be better for it.
*  We would figure out what is actually happening if we could clearly identify the
*  source of all these different things and let people know.
*  But people wouldn't even believe it right now.
*  People are so jaded right now.
*  If you said, Hey, this is a Russian troll.
*  People like, no, it's not.
*  You just work for Trump.
*  Yeah.
*  I know what's going on here.
*  You're not going to trick me.
*  My, my buddy Shane and I were talking about gaslighting this morning and he
*  flew, he and his buddies flew their helicopters over the Trump parade that
*  just happened here in Austin, like thousands of boats went out there and like
*  a few boats sunk and they're like one guy rented a boat and he forgot to put a
*  plug in there.
*  And one of them was like a really crappy fishing boat that shouldn't even been on
*  the water.
*  And then one guy bought a brand new boat.
*  Didn't even know how to operate it.
*  And poor guy sunk his boat, but Shane's like flying around and he sees everything,
*  you know, and they're in there.
*  Robinson's 44.
*  They're like doing these cool V flights and, um, you know, gaslighting is telling
*  somebody something that's not true.
*  They're seeing it with their eyes, but they're hearing that it's not real.
*  Right.
*  The original play gaslight was this guy making his wife be crazy.
*  He would, he would adjust the, he would be able to adjust the, the wick on his
*  gaslight.
*  So it would get darker in there and she'd be like, is it darker in here?
*  She's like, no, it's this what's wrong with you.
*  Are you crazy?
*  What's so we're in a time where people are telling us what we're supposed to be
*  seen, but that's not what we're seeing.
*  So I have this conflict.
*  Am I supposed to believe what I'm seeing right here?
*  But we're being gaslit by the wrong information that's being curated in our
*  hands, in our phones and on our TVs.
*  So the Lake Travis thing in reality, there's hundreds of boats, thousands,
*  thousands of boats that are supporting Trump three sunk, but the narrative you're
*  hearing in the media, there's like this catastrophe, catastrophe.
*  I wasn't there.
*  I was working, but my best friend is flying around in helicopters and he sees
*  the whole time he has videos of everybody.
*  Um, people are crazy on boats sometimes, but, um, you know, he literally sees the
*  whole entire Lake from a bird's eye view.
*  And he has photos of the, the boats, the boats, the few that got, were being
*  towed in and he's like, man, those were the crappiest, you know, like, I don't
*  even know how those things are on the water, but there was just people that
*  want to participate and, um, but what is this huge half the boat sunk there's
*  20 underwater, you know, there's this, this disaster of an event.
*  Shane's like, and I saw thousands of boats with, you know, titties being
*  shown and people dancing and Trump flags.
*  And am I being gaslit?
*  You know, he's asking this like that.
*  This is the definition of it is what you see.
*  Amazing that the narrative was the three failures.
*  But if we take that as the micro and blow that up to the macro of that happens in
*  absolutely everything, the shooting here in Austin, right?
*  We have what happened and then we have what we're told on both sides.
*  You know, I don't even, I don't think you could take the final version.
*  Of these two stories and be like, this is the same, the same situation.
*  Like there's no possible way that these two stories that went to the right and
*  went to the left that I'm now trying to.
*  Co-operate could, could, could have happened in the same situation.
*  Like that's how far the lies or the partial truths go.
*  So I don't know.
*  How do you fix that?
*  I think the only way to fix that is some kind of technology that allows you to
*  accurately read exactly what's going on.
*  That doesn't exist right now.
*  There would, there, there might be something on the horizon that there, like
*  some neural link type deal where they're working on the ability to bypass this.
*  The like right now, the connection between human beings and information is
*  you read it or you see it, but you don't really know what it is.
*  You know, you're reading it and you're seeing it.
*  You're getting confirmation.
*  You're not reading it.
*  See it's going from the person that is getting it to a thing.
*  And then that thing is controlling what the next group sees.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  That's a huge problem.
*  Yes.
*  Like I don't want my information curated.
*  I just want information.
*  Right.
*  And let me as a rational, rational, reasonable person be able to figure out.
*  That is the problem, right?
*  The problem is you can't trust whoever there's not, there's not an unbiased source.
*  There's not an unbiased, unconscionable, and every source is also a corporation.
*  They're all connected to the machine in some really deep and crazy way.
*  The tentacles run deep, whether it's CNN or Fox News or OAN or whatever the fuck it is.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever news source, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, they're all giant corporations.
*  They all have huge political investments and they're going to give you some, some
*  super distorted version of what's actually, there's not one person who will sit down.
*  There's not, there's no Walter Cronkite on television.
*  There's a few that are online.
*  You can get a bunch online and that's one of the reasons why online news journalism
*  is flourishing and so many people are turning to these people that are online.
*  Yeah.
*  But they're also flawed because they're, they're human and they have their own biases.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Andy No, I follow him on Twitter.
*  He's, he's been on the podcast.
*  He has.
*  Yeah.
*  Pretty, pretty, pretty a passionate guy now.
*  I guess he was assaulted by Tifa.
*  Yeah.
*  Hit him with like some cement milkshake or something.
*  Yeah.
*  And maybe the worst mistake they made because they ignited what was just kind
*  of an independent journalist.
*  Now he's like, Nope, I'm mad at Tifa.
*  You guys like beat me up.
*  You damaged my brain.
*  And, um, you know, but his journalism on Antifa, albeit trying to be as accurate
*  as possible, we know he has bias because he doesn't like them because they hit
*  him in the head, you know, and they beat him and they threw cement milkshakes at
*  him.
*  So even, even somebody that has, um, trying to do the right thing, it's
*  imperfect because with that person comes bias.
*  Like, how do we just get information?
*  Yeah.
*  Um, again, I really think that we're so limited because of the distribution
*  methods that we have right now for getting out information, allow for biases.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and I don't, I don't know what the future has in store, but I think
*  that we're going to come to a time in the not so distant future where you're
*  going to be able to know exactly what's real and what's not real.
*  Yeah.
*  I hope so.
*  That's so cool.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's going to be a lot of resistance against it too.
*  We're going to find out a lot of people are full of shit.
*  Yeah.
*  How cool would that be if, you know, like we have the fact checker, which is
*  like the biggest bullshit ever as a politician's talking, it's like fact
*  check and the person fact checking is the most bias furthest thing from
*  eject objective fact checks that you could possibly get.
*  It was like, but you're checking the facts.
*  What if at, as that person was talking real time, like this is true.
*  Here's like the truth, not Wikipedia statistics, not like Google also
*  curated statistics, not like information driven from whatever news corporation,
*  but just like the real data was next to that person as they're doing the next
*  debate, if a debate happens, that'd be cool.
*  I don't think it's going to happen.
*  No.
*  How can you not have a debate?
*  Biden's not going to do it.
*  I don't think he can.
*  I don't think he can stand there for that long and last.
*  I don't even know what his ideas are.
*  Yeah, but that's the point of the debate, right?
*  Is, is for me to learn about somebody's platform.
*  Well, you know, at this point he's doing well by not talking.
*  That's not doing well.
*  It hurts him.
*  No, I don't, I don't, I would never allow him.
*  If I was in the DNC, I'd be like, there's no way you're debating.
*  Trump's going to destroy him.
*  But that doesn't matter because the ideas are the thing that we're voting on.
*  But it doesn't matter because people want to see who can hang in a debate and they
*  don't want to vote for a loser.
*  So if the guy gets up there and falls apart in the debate and starts stumbling his
*  words and starts flubbing and forgetting what he was talking about, like Biden's
*  done on multiple occasions, a lot of people are not going to vote for him.
*  I swear.
*  I thought they have a scheduled debate in a couple of weeks.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  Don't tell me that.
*  I bet you a hundred bucks.
*  That's usually where I learn about somebody.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They're not trying to learn.
*  They're trying to win.
*  I don't know about, especially like, I love it when local politicians do debates
*  because those are like no hold barred truth attacks, you know, like, well, I know
*  you took money from this auto park place, you know, and like this guy's like, well,
*  I know you're getting money from, you know, Beto O'Rourke and you're like, this
*  is awesome.
*  You know, like I'm learning so much right now that there's no way I would have
*  learned and they do.
*  And, uh, so, I mean, we kind of have an idea about Trump's policies, but.
*  How do we learn about Biden's policies?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I think they just, I think Biden at this point just wants to win.
*  I think the best way they think to win is to keep them from talking too much.
*  If I really had to guess, like the only Kamala Harris is on doing a lot of
*  different interviews and talking.
*  What are you laughing at?
*  I'm trying to look up to see what the new information about debates is.
*  And this is the story I found.
*  Trump's burns traditional debate prep with first face off less than three days,
*  three weeks away.
*  What's he saying?
*  We're supposed to, they're supposed to be one in about three weeks, but
*  there we go.
*  He's not held a single mock debate and he said he doesn't need to.
*  President Trump has not held a single mock debate session as no plans to stage
*  a formal practice round as he readies for his first face off with Joe Biden.
*  Less than three weeks, according to multiple people familiar with the
*  discussions, the president has dismissed a typical debate preparations.
*  He participated in four years ago, joking to aides and allies that he's been
*  paid preparing for debates since he was born.
*  This is, this is what happens to fighters and they get their ass kicked.
*  His ability to fight back and an opponent in real time.
*  He's argued, isn't something you have to practice.
*  That's yeah, maybe instead Trump has so far chosen to prepare through informal
*  discussions with key allies and with briefings from top officials in his
*  administration on various topics that will likely come up like, or that are
*  likely to come up.
*  These people said, can you, would you do a debate?
*  Would I?
*  Yeah.
*  If, if like another problem I have with, if I had to do a debate, no, no, not,
*  not you debating somebody.
*  Oh, I'd prepare like a mother.
*  I know you would.
*  You'd be fun to watch, but, um, you be the control mechanism to the candidates.
*  Like a Biden Trump debate with Joe Rogan hosting your questions.
*  I would want that.
*  First of all, I'd want no one else in the room.
*  I just, just the three of us cameras.
*  So we, we can record the truth.
*  Yeah.
*  Just the three of us.
*  And you would have to stream it live.
*  So no one can edit it.
*  And I would want them in there for hours.
*  And ideas.
*  We get to hear what they actually believe in, what they're going to do, who they're
*  going to appoint, what judges are going to be coming in, what policies from gun
*  control to all of it.
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  Why can't we have that?
*  We should have that.
*  This is 2020.
*  I mean, we have the ability to have that.
*  We're not talking about 1979.
*  We're talking about 2020.
*  If they wanted to do that, they both wanted to come here in Austin, sit down
*  and have a debate.
*  I would 100% do it.
*  My God.
*  I would 100% do it.
*  Amazing.
*  It would be the best way to find out, but I don't think that Biden can handle it.
*  I think Biden is like, I think he's, I mean, people get mad at me for saying this.
*  I think there's something wrong and I don't think there's something wrong because
*  I'm guessing or because I'm pro Trump.
*  I've seen him fall apart.
*  I think I've seen him.
*  Just talking.
*  He's had multiple brain surgeries.
*  This is him saying, I sent you that thing yesterday, right?
*  Play it.
*  Look at this.
*  This is something.
*  I mean, I'm not trying to be biased in any way, shape or form.
*  I'm a Bernie Sanders supporter.
*  I just want a commander chief that will let me be do a commander in chief.
*  I like Tulsi.
*  Yeah.
*  I love Tulsi.
*  Jocko.
*  A hundred percent.
*  That that'd be a fun Jocko run for president.
*  Just to the beginning of it.
*  Just the beginning of it.
*  He starts talking about his brain surgery.
*  The only uncharted person, totally uncharted portion of the universe is the brain.
*  You know, I had, as we used to say in the Senate, excuse the point of personal privilege here.
*  I had two cranial aneurysms and they literally had to take the top of my head off.
*  I mean, they take a saw and they cut your head off and go in to find the artery that is
*  one was leaking, the other that hadn't before it burst.
*  Those of you who are docs know there's a, every profession has their sick jokes.
*  The joke among docs is how do you know someone's had a cranial aneurysm?
*  On the autopsy table.
*  Only 20% of the people haven't even get to the table.
*  Well, one of the fascinating things is the second operation after the first one, which
*  was a bleed and they gave me a relatively low chance of surviving.
*  I remember going down to Doc, asking the Doc, you know, you're counting the ceiling tiles
*  and you're heading into the operating room.
*  A lot of you have been there.
*  And I said, Doc, what are my chances?
*  Two great neurosurgeons.
*  I'll never forget.
*  I will not mention his name.
*  He's one of the leading neurosurgeons in the world.
*  He said, Senator, for mortality or morbidity?
*  And I'm thinking.
*  I swear to God, we're good.
*  Now, this is not a knock on this guy.
*  I'm happy he's alive.
*  But that this is what we're talking about.
*  We're talking about someone who these are legit issues.
*  This is not he's going to be sitting in a briefing room when.
*  A bunch of people from the Pentagon walk in and say, we have found the number one
*  terrorist on the planet.
*  What do you want us to do?
*  And that guy has to make a choice.
*  And this is, by the way, when he was vice president, this is this is quite a while ago.
*  This film.
*  So like.
*  OK, who the keeping something in the only thing that comes from isolation
*  is a Unabomber, like there's nothing good that you can take a candidate
*  and stick him in a basement and hide him there when he is going to have to be
*  in front of seven billion people and be their representative.
*  And both foreign and domestic about how we're going to be operating.
*  And if that's that scares me, it's weird.
*  It's I know there's other people that could run for president.
*  I just don't understand why they chose him and why they work so hard to make sure
*  that he's the guy. Yeah, it's it's weird that the Democrats chose that.
*  Do you think we're going to have regardless of who wins?
*  Do you think we're going to have a fair election?
*  I hope so. I don't know.
*  I'm not informed enough to make a, you know, a statement.
*  Do you think here we are in September?
*  We have September, October, and then we have the election.
*  Yeah, it's pretty quick. Super quick.
*  November 3rd is around the corner.
*  I argue that right now
*  people are trying to negatively affect our election for sure.
*  And we kind of have to be aware of that.
*  So the next time that you pick up your phone and you're like,
*  do you want to fry this guy, you know, at white privilege.
*  Twitter handle, I'm going to get you like that.
*  That person just wants you to do exactly what you're doing, which is be mad.
*  There's a high probability that there's a lot of that going on
*  and that it's just feeding the flames of hate.
*  Yeah. And it's even worse because we've had this stupid pandemic
*  that has locked people into the echo chamber of their own ideas.
*  And you could also say it's worse by the way Trump behaves
*  and the way he communicates this this polarizing way that got him famous.
*  You know, you're fired and fuck you and get out of here.
*  And all this this way that he's become famous.
*  It doesn't suit someone to be the commander in chief.
*  So all these people that say that he's not presidential, he's not.
*  He doesn't act like a statesman. They're right. They are right.
*  This is not what you would want from a person who's the leader.
*  You'd want someone who's exemplary.
*  You'd want someone who's speaking in a way that would make you proud.
*  Like that is an American president.
*  And the way the speaking part, that is what we got from Barack Obama.
*  What we got from him is so presidential, amazingly presidential.
*  Is presidential as anybody who's ever been?
*  I would argue more so than anybody ever, even than Clinton.
*  Clinton, when he was at his best, I think he was really good.
*  I think Obama was better.
*  But well-spoken, articulate, everything.
*  Yes. The measured, you know, it made you feel good
*  that a guy smarter than you was the president.
*  You don't feel like that with Trump.
*  You're like, Jesus, don't say that.
*  Oh, what the fuck are you doing? Get out of here.
*  It's like I'm not like I'm not a supporter of Trump.
*  What I'm seeing, what I'm seeing, though, is that if you're not
*  if you don't ignore all the things that are going on with Biden,
*  somehow or another, you're a bad person.
*  And that that to me as a person is a comedian, as a person who hates
*  fundamentalism, as a person who hates rabid ideology.
*  That's driving me crazy
*  because this shit is all right in front of you.
*  You're watching him stumble through his words constantly left and right.
*  We're ignoring the fact that he's 77 years old.
*  We're ignoring all these signs that show I'm not saying
*  that you should vote for Trump.
*  What I'm saying is how the fuck are the Democrats running with this?
*  How is this in 2020?
*  This is what we're doing. Yeah.
*  This is this is what we're doing.
*  And even the choice of Tulsi Cameron, like, I mean,
*  of of locking Tulsi Garrett out, rather the choice of eliminating her.
*  The whole thing sat with me. It's so it's so gross the way they did it,
*  the way they pushed her out, the way they wouldn't even let her speak at the DNC.
*  It's wrong. And, you know, and it was almost like she got canceled by her own party.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's exactly what it's like.
*  And that's that's evil. Right.
*  Like we have a smart veteran to two terms or six terms rather.
*  Six years as a congresswoman, two two overseas tours, two been a congresswoman
*  for six fucking years.
*  Exemplary record. Really reasonable, really intelligent.
*  Displays all of the things you would all the qualities of leadership
*  that you would want from someone running for president.
*  But let's doctor. Yeah. Let's do that.
*  Yeah. What? The whole thing was crazy.
*  The whole thing was crazy.
*  And then and then his choice to choose like he literally said,
*  I'm going to choose a woman as a running man.
*  Well, how about choose the best person?
*  That best person happens to be a woman. That's great.
*  But if you tell me you're going to specifically eliminate males.
*  Well, you're you're thinking in terms of identity politics.
*  Is this the same Joe Biden that's been in politics for 50 fucking years?
*  All of a sudden, you're an ideologue who is going with identity politics
*  over the best person for the job. Absolutely. Clearly.
*  Clearly. This is crazy talk.
*  Kamala. So the parties defund the police.
*  Right. Like that's a left progressive idea.
*  She is literally the police. She's a cop. Yeah.
*  And not like if we're going to solidarity to Black Lives Matter
*  and believe that we can positively affect change, what she was doing
*  as a cop, she's the worst of the cops.
*  She was targeting in the most racist, vicious way, trying to attack.
*  Black communities and black, you know, not even criminals, like drug
*  drug users and just hammered them with everything she possibly could.
*  And but now she's our vice president president.
*  Not only that, she withheld evidence that would show that people were innocent,
*  withheld it from defense attorneys.
*  She kept people incarcerated
*  to use them as cheap labor to fight fire when they were supposed to be released.
*  What do we have to do to get a Tulsi Jocko or a rock?
*  You like the rock, right? I love the rock. Yeah.
*  He would be like a Tulsi Rock or like a Tulsi Jocko.
*  They could literally win.
*  They could literally win. And I would be 100 percent in support of that.
*  It's just we're dealing with this machine, man.
*  And this machine wants to stay in control.
*  And who is going to be a good player for the machine?
*  Who's going to who's going to do the right thing?
*  Who's going to do the bidding?
*  I mean, this is how they got Bernie Sanders out.
*  Both times they weaseled them out.
*  And he still he bends the knee to them every time.
*  What? I don't know why he's a good guy.
*  I don't know. Doesn't want conflict. I don't know.
*  Yeah. He's a very reasonable guy.
*  When I had a ton of respect for him,
*  while I disagree with a lot of his positions in politics,
*  I disagree with a bunch of Tulsi's on on foreign policy about how to do that.
*  But that would be a conversation she and I can.
*  Yes. Well, I would love to have you have that because the way you explain it
*  and from your own personal experience serving,
*  this is not just some fucking airy fairy ideas.
*  I go everywhere with these things like I journal, kind of like I take
*  little weird notes and you could go and they're all dated
*  from Tripster, Iraq to Afghanistan to Niger, to Nigeria,
*  to Burkina Faso, to Mauritania, to
*  Morocco, to South Africa, like every freaking crazy place that I have to go.
*  And you could look and then like go forward two years, three years
*  and look again and be like, what? Look at this change.
*  I can see black and white written in front of you.
*  And my impressions of physically being there at the same place,
*  removed by 24 months.
*  And that has happened time and time again.
*  But that's why I wanted to have you want to talk about this,
*  because this is a narrative that doesn't get discussed,
*  because it's either you're pro Trump or you're pro Biden.
*  And if you're for Trump, you're a racist.
*  And if you're for Biden, you're a fool.
*  Like this. It's like these narratives are so goddamn stupid
*  and they're so damaging to us.
*  And I think a lot of them have been reinforced and stoked.
*  The flames have been stoked by people in other countries that are that are acting
*  as trolls. I think that's a lot of what's going on.
*  There's a fucking great video. See if you can find the cat.
*  What? You got some else? Yeah.
*  As you guys are talking, I found something I didn't want to interrupt with,
*  but to support what we're talking about
*  as our veins were popping, both Joe and I were like,
*  Russian, Chinese and Iranian hackers, all targeting 2020 election,
*  Microsoft says, so they're not a blog today and they detail what's been going
*  on with these companies. But does this surprise anyone?
*  So if they're doing this, what else are they doing in real time?
*  So they're not just online.
*  No, you don't think that there are we call them Jedberg's.
*  If you don't think that there are foreign operatives that are working here,
*  both at universities and in cities, part of the political process
*  or part of the Tifa strategic strategic organization,
*  they are doing this in real time in person.
*  Not just online. This is crazy.
*  We've observed. Yeah.
*  Strong Strontium operating from Russia has attacked more than 200 organizations,
*  including political campaigns, advocacy groups, parties and political consultants.
*  Zirconium operating in China has attacked high profile individuals
*  associated with the election, including people associated with the Joe Biden
*  for President campaign and the prominent leaders in the international affairs
*  community. Phosphorus operating from Iran has continued to attack
*  the personal accounts of people associated with Donald J.
*  Trump for President campaign. Yeah, they're they're fucking with us.
*  But look, yeah, is it one side or the other?
*  No, no. All over the place.
*  Trump, Biden, the parties, the consultants.
*  The point is they have to diligent, delegitimize the process. Right.
*  And and the only way and the best way to do it is just to make it look bad
*  and to make us fight and to make us argue.
*  And like the fact that there's people walking down the street being like,
*  I hate cops. You guys are evil.
*  Like, do you know any or did you just read what you've just been reading?
*  What has been echoed like my friend, Matt Sun, who called the cops
*  when the fucking the house was making noise?
*  That's that's that's who these people are.
*  Hey, the there's a video of a crow fucking with these two cats.
*  It's one of my favorite videos.
*  There's a crow and there's these two cats that are looking at each other
*  from opposing rooftops and like looking at each other.
*  And the crow gets over and gets near the cat and starts fucking with him.
*  The cats get out of here. Watch this.
*  So here's the cat and there's a crow and the crow flies over
*  and starts fucking with these cats and gets these cats to duke it out.
*  He literally instigates this fight.
*  Look, he flies over like a fucking bird is coming near a cat.
*  Why would he do that?
*  He's doing it because he wants to fuck with him.
*  So he gets him a little agitated and then he flies back
*  and gets him a little agitated, just fucks with him just a little bit.
*  And then he flies over to the other cat and he goes back and forth
*  and fucks with look at he goes behind him and fucks with him.
*  He's irritating him.
*  Crows are fucking smart, man.
*  And this little cunt just starts pestering these cats and gets these cat.
*  Look at him. He's pecking at his ass.
*  He's literally looks and the cat.
*  I'm going to fight.
*  And the cat reacts by jumping over and fucking attacking the other cat.
*  They go off the edge.
*  Boom. And the crow follows him.
*  This fucking crow is a monster.
*  That crow is all the online trolls.
*  These are Biden and Trump supporters engaged in more mortal combat here.
*  Look at the crow.
*  Look, they go down the fucking hole where the basement is.
*  And the crows like, ah, ah, fucking losers.
*  Losers fight.
*  You're black. You're white. Fight.
*  Isn't that amazing? Yeah.
*  That video is amazing. That's it right there.
*  I fucking love that video.
*  That video is exactly what's going on right now.
*  They were just looking at each other.
*  The cats are just looking at each other.
*  They probably would have gone the rest of the day without fighting.
*  Yeah, that crow.
*  Lap in some milk, chasing a mouse, you know, but no, they got the
*  cunt of a crow started all that shit.
*  God have fired up.
*  And that that that crow is Russia and China and Iran and every other country that hates us.
*  And then those two nice, peaceful cats fell off a roof fighting.
*  But that's what we're doing.
*  We were like literally pushing each other off cliffs.
*  There's another one.
*  Crows do it constantly.
*  Look at them. Look at them.
*  Just walking up to that cat and fuck with them.
*  They like watching fights.
*  Look at him. He's like, yeah, get after it, boys.
*  Get after it.
*  Get top, get time on.
*  How funny is that?
*  The crows like to do that.
*  So awesome.
*  They do it on purpose.
*  Those little twats.
*  It's kind of amazing.
*  It is kind of amazing.
*  I mean, I cut props to the crow for figuring that out.
*  But I guess crows are just like people.
*  We all like watching fights.
*  Yeah. And and looking at Americans, it's pretty easy to know how to piss us off now.
*  Yes. Like every single one of these little hot button topics pop up.
*  There's somebody over there like, oh, I'm going to push that button.
*  Then a new button pops up like, oh, I'm going to push that button.
*  How many buttons can we have right now because we're getting so pissed off at everything?
*  Yeah, we're all button.
*  We're all button. Yeah, we're full of buttons.
*  Go outside. Go exercise.
*  Go do something. Go do.
*  Go have sex. Yeah, please.
*  You know, if you want to make a change, like don't throw a Molotov cocktail.
*  Go find a police officer and talk to him for a little bit or go find
*  go to Baltimore and talk to the black community there and figure out how you can help.
*  You know, like has anyone gone and figured out how they can help one of these communities?
*  No, because they don't care.
*  No, that's that's not that doesn't get you Instagram likes.
*  The other thing that's going on to that, I mean, I
*  the timing of the fucking pandemic is so crazily perfect.
*  I'm not a conspiracy theorist in the sense like I don't I don't believe in nonsense.
*  There's just too much nonsense going on.
*  But God, if I was, I would be looking at this.
*  I'm like, this is this is so perfectly organized.
*  And then the response like key people from working, key people from working.
*  So what? So they're broke and scared and angry.
*  And then they're even more subject to this shit.
*  And now as we're what five months removed, we're having that same conversation
*  about schools, well, schools is a necessary component for people to work.
*  Like if your kids aren't in school, you can't go to work
*  because that's a form of child care for a lot of households.
*  Yes. And we're like, oh, it's not sure it's safe.
*  You I was joking about injecting myself with Covid in my neck.
*  Like you could take my breastfed babies that eat elk and free range chickens
*  and have lived in safety and security their entire lives.
*  And you could like cover the whole entire room with Covid.
*  And my 10 month old is going to poop that stuff out in like an hour,
*  you know, because they're healthy, balanced, powerful individuals.
*  My teenage daughters, like we have not lived a day in this whole entire pandemic,
*  really recognizing what we're supposed to be doing.
*  We have maintained health outside activities, exercise,
*  hunting, real food and like.
*  So so better situated and prepared now
*  for what looks like a scary six months in the future.
*  I'm scared because this entire country, six billion people have been locked up
*  moving into an election that is going to be a frightening.
*  Dangerous election.
*  Yeah, so there's no winners in this election.
*  But it's whoever wins.
*  Whoever wins is going to be chaos.
*  So you think when you say I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
*  but here we are with a pandemic that shut down our economy for five months
*  on an election year that looks like it was the origin is in China.
*  What are your theories?
*  I just think that, first of all, though, I talking to Brett Weinstein
*  about it, who's a biologist, and he went into great.
*  If you you're listening to this podcast, please go back and listen.
*  The most recent podcast I did with Brett, which is like what, four months ago,
*  Jamie, three months ago, maybe something along those lines.
*  Yeah, maybe maybe even two months ago.
*  He detailed the the scientific reasons
*  why he believes this came from a lab.
*  And there is a and it's and he said, I do not know for certain.
*  But with with reasonable speculation, you could look at this and say,
*  this makes a lot of sense that was come from because of these particular reasons.
*  Yeah. That lab was cited in 2018 for safety violations.
*  This is I mean, China, because because it's a communist country, right?
*  Because they're a dictatorship.
*  There's not a lot of incentive to behave the way you would hope
*  that an organization would behave.
*  Like you're you're under the knife of in the boot of the government all the time.
*  That people don't do the best work when they're scared like that.
*  Now, and that lab was sensitive.
*  No incentive. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You know how much you work.
*  Fear is your only incentive.
*  Yeah. You don't get anything more for working harder or better.
*  Right. You just don't get killed.
*  So 2018, they were cited for safety violations.
*  This is exactly the same area where they're doing this work on coronaviruses
*  from bats. And this is exactly where the origin of the disease was.
*  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that it came from there.
*  They don't think that it came on purpose, though.
*  They think it was just a sloppy leak from the lab.
*  Sometimes things happen where they're just perfectly aligned.
*  And then people take advantage of those opportunities.
*  They take advantage of these situations.
*  Like there's a lot of people that believe that 9-11 was an inside job.
*  What I think is when they found when 9-11 happened,
*  I think there was many people that took advantage of the chaos.
*  And there was things that were passed like the Patriot Act.
*  Oh, they're going to be fired up on that.
*  Let's reference that constitution again.
*  Yeah. It's sweeping.
*  I talked to Snowden recently.
*  These sweeping just overall surveillance of law abiding citizens
*  that are doing nothing wrong.
*  And they lied about it. They lied about it.
*  They all lied about it. They lied about the Congress.
*  Lied about it to our face.
*  Obama lied about it. Everybody lied about it.
*  They knew what the fuck they were doing.
*  They took advantage of the fact that people were scared
*  and they started just just going in everybody's shit.
*  Single most intrusive moment in American history
*  in our freedoms, not being encroached on not like a little trickle of,
*  you know, cut by a thousand or death by a thousand cuts like 9-11 happened.
*  We lost and gave up so much of our perceived
*  rights, right?
*  Like, no, you can't look at my emails.
*  Like I thought my emails were protected like my mail.
*  You can't open my mail without a warrant.
*  There's a due process to that. That's gone.
*  Right. Like I think every single 20 year old right now expects
*  that every text message that they send and every Facebook message,
*  DM, Instagram, Twitch,
*  every one of those things can be read by somebody else
*  that they don't own that stuff.
*  That's not how I grew up.
*  I grew up like that was my ideas.
*  Those are my words. Those that's my property.
*  If somebody wants it, they have to have a warrant to look at it.
*  Now, go from 9-11 to Corona.
*  Now, the second most serious time that we lost more of our freedoms,
*  9-11 and this Winston Churchill said never waste a good crisis.
*  Yes. And you want to know when a government is going to overreach.
*  It's in crisis. Yes.
*  And if you are not a strong, healthy individual
*  that is able to be self-sufficient and be able to rationally look at things
*  without getting spun up by the echo chamber that you're living in, in Twitter,
*  you're going to allow that to happen because you're just being
*  pitted against each other by this dribble
*  that's being pushed into your face by people that are just trying to profiteer
*  off of what you see and what you hear and what you think.
*  That's exactly what I think is happening right now.
*  That's exactly what I think is happening.
*  I think there's people that are taking advantage of this crisis.
*  So I think the way to fight that is as a society to unify,
*  to reasonably, collectively be like, no, you said they can't.
*  You know, they canceled Halloween.
*  Yeah, they can't cancel Halloween.
*  It's fucking crazy. No, they can't.
*  The only way that they can is you allowing it to happen.
*  Yeah. Right. They can't shut down your salon.
*  They can't tell you can't go door to door and trick or treat.
*  Right. They can't. They cannot.
*  They can't do that. They can try.
*  And the only way that they can't do it is if you go and do it.
*  But the fact is, there's no uniformity because they're allowing people to protest.
*  So you're allowing people to protest about some things about some things.
*  Because Black Lives Matter. That's it allowed.
*  Yeah. You can't counter covid protest. Right.
*  You can't do that. Evidently you won't get covid.
*  Los Angeles backtracks on coronavirus trick or treat.
*  Ban this Halloween. Good. You fucks.
*  They should drown you all.
*  The fact that you even considered it.
*  Dunk you all in toilets.
*  Yeah, we did. We did it in an hour.
*  We changed California.
*  Well, everybody freaked out.
*  I bet 30,000 people moved out of California the day they read that.
*  My wife got a text from one of her friends.
*  She's like, fuck this. I'm out of here.
*  And she sent her the news on on California banning trick or treat.
*  That was her. That was her thing.
*  Now, pedophilia alone would be another reason to leave.
*  You know, I'd be out of California pretty.
*  Is there a lot of pedophilia in California?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, here's another legislation that's kind of being passed.
*  Oh, what is that? You put that on your Instagram.
*  Is it is that real?
*  Yeah, is that 100 percent legit? That's real.
*  So does that really mean that a 20 year old can have sex with a 10 year old?
*  Ten year because it's a 10 year difference.
*  So but isn't statutory rape anybody who's under 18?
*  Yeah. So no, it's lessening the penalty for it.
*  So let's say a and the the trans community,
*  LGBTQ community was in big support of this bill
*  because it's not fair for male to female.
*  So if let's say a 17 year old has sex with a 15 year old and she gets or I'm sorry,
*  a 19 year old has sex with a 15 year old and she gets pregnant.
*  There is a law in place where
*  the penalty, he is not going to go on the sex registry
*  because he is a father to that child would have a difficult time
*  being able to if he's on a sex registry, get a job, pay for child support.
*  So they have kind of protections in place where if that's only in California.
*  Yeah. But if he had
*  orally or anally had sex with her, then the law would be
*  the penalty would be more severe, severe.
*  He would be on the sex offender list
*  because he's not trying to procreate.
*  So the the community like the LGBTQ community was like, this is an unfair
*  law because, you know, it's a gay relationship.
*  They have a harsher penalty than a male and female relationship.
*  So they should be the same if.
*  Well, I recognize that and I acknowledge that that's the case.
*  And I want it to be fair, but I also don't want a 19 year
*  or 24 year old having sex with a 15 year old.
*  Yeah, no, I don't care where it is.
*  You know, that's crazy. There's a reason 18 is 18.
*  I mean, it's a good number.
*  It's not it should be later.
*  Well, do you think you should be?
*  Well, I mean, to have sex, I guess 18.
*  But like I was a disaster at 18.
*  Well, I was too. But I can vote at 18.
*  But if I was 18 and a 23 year old woman wanted to fuck me,
*  I don't think she should go to jail.
*  No, I was ready. Yeah.
*  I mean, 18 year olds are ready.
*  Like the problem is our perceptions of sex.
*  I mean, I'm talking about someone who's a grown adult.
*  I feel like 18 is at least pretty close to a grown adult.
*  Maybe, you know, voting, we should extend to 21 where drinking is.
*  It might not be the worst idea in the world.
*  But as far as like being responsible for your actions, 18 is a good number.
*  18 is where and that was the point of my post is
*  that that person can have consent.
*  Yes. Like the way there's written was somebody willfully
*  having an oral sex. Right.
*  I'm saying anybody under 18, if you can't.
*  But you're not willful.
*  You're not allowed to be willful. Right.
*  Because you don't have the right to have consent yet. Right.
*  You're too young. Too young. You're not an adult. No.
*  Yeah, that's a fucked up law.
*  And then we only get the crazy sex trafficking of.
*  But I saw the picture of the guy who made the bill to dress
*  with like a fucking dog collar on. He's a weirdo.
*  I don't make any laws, especially around sex.
*  Yeah, it's but I just don't understand how it passed.
*  It did. It's on.
*  I mean, it has to be signed.
*  How the fuck is that?
*  It just has to be signed by Newsyn.
*  It's so yeah, passed legislation hasn't been.
*  Yeah, it's it's it's passed.
*  Yeah, that's what I was like.
*  It's you just need a wet ink signature.
*  Jesus Christ, that seems so insane that a 20 year old can fuck a 10 year old.
*  Yeah, like a 20 year old can have a 10 year old boyfriend
*  and decide that it's consent.
*  A 20 year old man can have a 10 year old boyfriend.
*  And as long as it's within the 10 year boundary, you're OK.
*  Like, again, I realize unconscious bias.
*  I have a pretty jaded view of things.
*  And when it comes to like children,
*  you know, heavily involved in counter sex trafficking,
*  you know, moving from deliver fund to Guardian Group
*  to now with Victor Marks,
*  you know, fighting worldwide and and and nationally like
*  the this disgusting thing that is pedophilia.
*  Like that is not a sexual orientation.
*  And people in power like finding children to victimize.
*  And they are worth money.
*  But there's a thing now where people are trying to portray it
*  as a sexual inclination, as a sexual proclivity.
*  Like there's a TEDx talk about.
*  Have you seen that?
*  Or this woman is talking about how we have to have compassion
*  for pedophilia the same way we have compassion for homosexuals or trans people.
*  And it's like, what are you talking about?
*  Well, I mean, I have compassion for the person,
*  but I'm not going to have compassion for any of their actions.
*  And if they need help, we can get them help, like put them in an institution
*  and they can realign whatever their problems are.
*  But also being attracted to a child is a period.
*  Wrong end of story.
*  I don't care what you think.
*  Agreed. 100 percent.
*  But here's the thing. How does that woman know?
*  Like this is the thing about pedophilia, like someone who's not a pedophile
*  to say that this person is a pedophile can't help themselves.
*  How do you know?
*  Like, what do you what are you basing this on?
*  Are you basing you're not basing on your own personal feelings?
*  Like, I know I am attracted to women.
*  That's I know it because it's it's and I know there's a lot of people like me.
*  Right. And so if I talk to another guy and he goes, that girl's hot.
*  Yes, she is hot. I get it.
*  I see what you see.
*  But if you're talking about someone who's attracted to children,
*  that's so fucking alien to me.
*  So if you're telling me that someone can't help themselves
*  because this is a natural sexual inclination, like how do you know that?
*  I don't I don't know that that's true.
*  And I don't know what the fuck you do to save them or to fix them.
*  I don't know. But I think the primary concern is protecting children.
*  Primary, more than like like having compassion for pedophiles.
*  You know, protection.
*  We have to put action to that word.
*  What does protection look like?
*  That is law. That is legislation.
*  That is people that are being able to stand, not not allow evil to happen.
*  Right. For evil to conquer.
*  It just takes good men doing nothing.
*  Standing back and be like, yeah, I mean, I guess they could recognize
*  and align themselves with being attracted.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Not a chance. The idea is something.
*  And you touch a child.
*  I'm going to tell you that's going to end.
*  Yeah, not good. No.
*  Yeah. And it shouldn't.
*  And that's how everybody feels.
*  Everybody has children.
*  And specifically, fuck.
*  Just the fact that that actually can get all the way through
*  to the governor's office is bonkers.
*  Yeah. Well, who knows what he's going to do?
*  It's for him.
*  You know, lick his finger, find out which way the wind's blowing.
*  How progressive am I going to be here?
*  You know, I'm all I'm all about getting reelected.
*  And his chances of reelecting now are fucking slim to none.
*  Thank God they hate him now.
*  Oh, my God. He was the darling of California.
*  Beautiful man. Slick back hair.
*  Looking great. Speaks well.
*  They fucking hate him there now.
*  My brother says most of my sister lives in Paso and her husband,
*  who I call my brother because we've been best friends for kids since kids.
*  He works for a nuclear power plant, Chad.
*  And so he's he's pretty like military go getter, hard worker.
*  You know, my sister is a homeschooler.
*  She's homeschooled all their kids and they're brilliant.
*  Like play multiple instruments like, you know, grades ahead of everybody else.
*  And while the whole entire world is like, what are we going to do about education?
*  My sister's like individual responsibility.
*  You could have been doing it yourself.
*  Not everybody has that opportunity.
*  I understand.
*  My my my parents were being landowners, my brother being a police officer.
*  Like we have been in California for, you know, that's where I grew up.
*  And we have been fighting for rational, reasonable.
*  Politics in that in that and we feel like we're in a foreign land.
*  Yeah. You know, you ask how I came to Texas is like.
*  As a coward, I just couldn't.
*  I said I wanted to be in a fight that I that I chance of winning.
*  Yeah. Like maybe now for the first time, California has a has a hope,
*  a chance of like changing the course of where they've been.
*  The trajectory damage has been done, though.
*  You can do it and you can do it.
*  I love Dan Crenshaw's man.
*  And if he said that if every law that's written, we have to unwrite another law,
*  you know, it's a hard thing to do to take legislation
*  that's already been approved and passed and then remove it.
*  That's a harder thing than getting the new law. Right.
*  So now we have like this crazy amount of laws, both local, state, federal,
*  and they just keep stacking on top of each other.
*  And they're not none of them are good or most of them are.
*  I love Dan Crenshaw.
*  There's that's another guy should run for president.
*  Yeah, we just I just think California.
*  I mean, there was an article that was written about me being a coward.
*  I'm leaving. Like, yeah, yeah, totally.
*  You should stay in fight like, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you.
*  For a bunch of reasons, we could start with you not letting people go back to work.
*  I think that's unconstitutional and insane.
*  And I think that's so short sighted and people are furious.
*  And then when you see Nancy Pelosi go to a fucking hair salon without a mask,
*  you're like, oh, I see how you people really are.
*  You can also never listen to anyone that is telling you to lose a gun
*  when they're protected by private security.
*  A hundred percent. You saw that with the mayor of Chicago.
*  She's all for protest until they came to her block.
*  And she's like, get the protests off my block.
*  I have a right to protect myself.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  That's what everybody's saying.
*  Yes, you hypocrite.
*  It's just and this is what happens when people get into power.
*  This is my problem.
*  They're protected in title positions, surrounded by people with guns.
*  And they're telling other people, us, you can't go to salons.
*  You can't you can't get your hair done.
*  You can't go and have a gun.
*  But I'm going to sit here in my high tower because I know what's best for you.
*  I don't know what the solution is.
*  I've thought this vote them out.
*  Yeah, vote them out. But even then, I think there's a problem with one person
*  running things. I mean, I really think there's a problem with a mayor or a
*  governor. I think there should be a committee.
*  I think there should be a group of people.
*  There there there is.
*  Right. You have your city council.
*  So here in Austin, we have a dumb mayor and that mayor has a bunch of city
*  council people that also dumb that are also dumb and do dumb things like defund
*  the police. Yeah. But thank God, the hundred million.
*  Yeah. One hundred fifty.
*  Hundred fifty. Yeah.
*  The governor stepped in and said, OK, well, if you do that, you don't get any
*  property taxes. So genius.
*  He's brilliant. Yeah.
*  It's a brilliant move by the governor.
*  And if safety becomes so such a concern here, he will roll in state police to.
*  Make up, yeah, the difference.
*  Good. Thank you, Texas.
*  Yes, you're going to learn a little bit about them.
*  They're amazing. Department of Public Safety for Texas.
*  It's it's our state police force there.
*  They're incredible. They have this super military academy.
*  I think people, when they hear military, like as I was talking about that virtual
*  reality training that we're going to get to law enforcement, they're like, wait,
*  why is this special forces guy training law enforcement?
*  Like they don't need a police officer doesn't need to be special forces.
*  Now, you don't need a tank or an AT4 or a 50 cal unless you're fighting the cartels.
*  But what you do need is the process of the refiner's fire and being able to train
*  imperfections out of people.
*  Could you imagine if a city council member had to ride along with the police for a month?
*  That's a great idea to go on the calls with them.
*  Domestic disputes, pullovers for DUIs not sit in the car.
*  They got to get out and walk up to that car.
*  They got to put their hand on the back of the car, put their fingerprint on there,
*  because if they die, they want a little bit of evidence.
*  You know, police officers do that every time they walk up to a car.
*  If you watch them, they go and they'll like put their thumb or their hand on the back
*  of the car. So their print is on the car.
*  So if they get killed there later, you can find out who did it.
*  That crazy how sad that is.
*  But as that police officer is walking up there, hello, sir.
*  You know, you're going 85 in a 65.
*  I smell alcohol.
*  I have to ask you to get out of the car.
*  We're going to do a sobriety check here on the side of the road, which is dangerous.
*  And over here is the city council member that was just recently elected.
*  And they're going to be observing this.
*  How cool is that?
*  It would be a good idea.
*  I would eliminate a lot of people from that fucking job.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  They'd also not they'd understand.
*  Like you said, how do we get this information out?
*  Like if you could do anything to, you know, like Tulsi Gaber and I are going to debate
*  about foreign policy.
*  I first have to explain and let them understand what I've seen.
*  And that's a hard thing to do unless somebody sees it.
*  And then it changes, you know, their view.
*  Yeah. Fun times, man.
*  What do you think happens in November?
*  Do you think, first of all, do you think that this whole voting by mail thing,
*  which is being hotly contested, it's so odd.
*  I get very nervous when one side's really into it and one side's really not into it.
*  I don't like that. That makes me real nervous because I don't know what the fuck is going on.
*  Man, everything that like if you pull my wallet out, I have a license
*  from the FAA.
*  Like I had to send them a whole bunch of stuff for me to be able to get into a helicopter.
*  Right. I have my driver's license.
*  I have my concealed carry permit of my security consulting license.
*  I have my D.O.D.I.D.
*  Like that's five different IDs that are like I can't go do anything in any one of those fields
*  without it. A little picture of my face.
*  And and I really like that because like I can't access a government computer without that card.
*  I can't go in and signed my my my annual review, my NCR,
*  without my card.
*  And it's like proof of who I am and what I'm doing.
*  And the thought that they're going to mail out tens of thousands, if not millions of ballots to
*  dead people to.
*  They don't even know who they're just sending them to addresses.
*  Did you see what the what's her name?
*  Kayleigh McEnany.
*  How do you say her name?
*  The woman is the White House press secretary.
*  She see if you can find this.
*  She said that one hundred and seventeen percent of the people that are registered to vote in
*  California.
*  There's just find the quote because it's kind of crazy.
*  But she was talking about here's the problem.
*  She was arguing for against voter voting online or excuse me voting by mail.
*  She's like this is why.
*  Like what is happening here where there's 17 percent more people than are registered to vote
*  that have the opportunity to vote in California.
*  There there in 2016.
*  I know I butchered that.
*  Other stuff ready to go for this.
*  I've been paying attention to this.
*  OK. There's like no proof of voter fraud by mail that I've looked up and found that anybody
*  else has been looking up and find they're just saying that it's going to be a problem without
*  providing evidence.
*  Nobody's done it though.
*  Yeah. No one's done at this scale.
*  I mean no one's done it like they're going to do it.
*  What they're saying is they're trying to do all the voting by mail or a giant percentage of it by
*  mail. That's never happened before.
*  The same with the post office problem.
*  They're like no we're not going to negatively affect the elections.
*  We're going to try to do everything that we can.
*  But like the post office is like I don't know if we can do this right now.
*  Yeah. When someone's saying there's no evidence for voter fraud in the past.
*  Yeah right. But what percentage of people voted by mail in the past has been reasonably small.
*  Find out that McKenney quote because it's a kind of crazy thing.
*  One hundred and seventeen percent California registered.
*  She she was explaining how there's there's multiple issues with this like these people that are
*  sending in these mail in ballots like how many of these people how many of these are legit.
*  How do you find out how much how much research has to be done.
*  How much investigation has to be done to make sure that these are legit ballots.
*  You see some of the districts in Illinois during the twenty six election 2016 election.
*  There was like one hundred and four percent came in for Obama.
*  Yeah. Like that's not right.
*  Some it's possible.
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  It's like I'm one hundred percent committed.
*  OK good. I'm one hundred ten percent committed.
*  That is impossible.
*  You can't be.
*  You stop there. You can't be one hundred and ten.
*  I know you want a bigger number but that's an American thing to want.
*  But what I'm trying to look this up for her.
*  All I'm finding are reports saying that she's voted by bail a lot of times.
*  Yeah but that's not where we're asking.
*  I know and I'm looking for the article.
*  So hard to find.
*  I'm trying to find the specific.
*  Have you ever started to type in like a Twitter search.
*  Just write one hundred and seventeen percent voter by mail.
*  When you type in like on Twitter for example like if you put Trump in a hashtag the things that
*  populate underneath that.
*  Oh my God.
*  So see.
*  Yeah it's like a train ride.
*  Trump's evil.
*  Trump the white supremacist.
*  But those are the ones that automatically populate.
*  Yeah.
*  Now are they.
*  Project Veritas did a funny thing.
*  They were showing where they knew things were trending throughout the world.
*  And here in the United States at a crazy hundreds of thousands of retweets through
*  this hashtag.
*  But none of it were going to automatically populate in a search under that same thing.
*  Well there's a real problem with that for sure.
*  The bias on social media is unstoppable.
*  It's not just social media.
*  Yes information searches when you're trying like my voice.
*  I love my daughter Julia and she was preparing I think she was 16 or 15.
*  She was preparing for like a debate and she was getting information and she's just like
*  Googling the stuff.
*  And I was like so you know in college I was we weren't allowed to do that and citing
*  our sources like they had to be like very specific and how that process works.
*  And you know when you do real research she's like well Google is just giving me the
*  information.
*  I was like no no Google is just giving you the information that Google wants you to
*  have.
*  She's like but I'm just Google like she could not compute that the information that
*  she was being given from a search that it wasn't just a search.
*  Right.
*  And how do you.
*  Yeah how do you explain to somebody that the information that they're reading isn't all
*  of the real information.
*  It's only a portion.
*  It has to take it takes a long time before you really digest that.
*  YouTube is another weird one where like kind of hot topic issues from an opposing idea.
*  Those get buried.
*  Well how about all these doctors that were against this idea of the pandemic and the
*  lockdown.
*  They were saying we need we need herd immunity like real doctors and I don't agree with
*  them.
*  I'm not saying that they're right but I'm saying that like they were all banned like some
*  doctors are saying we use hydroxychloroquine and Z packs and I've had amazing success
*  treating patients banned video banned the dangerous information.
*  My own doctor my own doctor said hydroxychloroquine is fantastic if you catch it early.
*  He goes it really stops the propagation of the disease if you catch it early.
*  But the lot of doctors that but it becomes it becomes political.
*  Brendan Schaub when he got covid you know the doctor said to him he said I don't know
*  what your political leanings are but I really believe in hydroxychloroquine.
*  He's like what the fuck are you saying my political leaning.
*  How does it have anything to do with my health.
*  Exactly use give me the shit that works.
*  I don't want to get sick.
*  He's like I got covid and so he got on the hydroxychloroquine.
*  He was good in three days.
*  Like you have the red pill and the blue pill.
*  Yeah and they're both crazy pills.
*  Can I just have what's in the middle.
*  You know that that that rational reasonable.
*  Yeah give me a purple pill.
*  Yeah it's a weird fucking time for everything.
*  You don't have to find that Jamie if you give up.
*  I mean I've said I found that actually an article from two years ago explaining what
*  how that number was recently out there.
*  I know this video she's talking about it.
*  I found it in the transcripts but I'm trying to say that like how they found out that
*  there's one hundred and twelve percent of the people that are registered to vote.
*  There's an explanation for it.
*  People move and they don't fix it like right.
*  OK.
*  So her description of it is she's making it seem like it's fraud.
*  It's not fraud.
*  It's just people that are like it doesn't make sense does it.
*  No that doesn't make sense and then moves on.
*  So it's like it's not that's fraud.
*  So she's playing a little game.
*  Yeah that's what she does.
*  Yeah she's pretty good.
*  There's a whole thing going on today that Trump was being interviewed by Bob Woodward
*  for his book.
*  Yes.
*  Back in February he's downplaying downplaying is the word that's going all over the
*  Internet.
*  He's downplaying the yeah the vibe the thing.
*  Yeah.
*  She then said he's not downplaying it when he's on tape saying I'm downplaying it and
*  now he's coming out saying those words I used on tape are not the words I said.
*  It's like what didn't she.
*  She said there was also a thing where she was confronted by a press person about that
*  and she said read the rest of his quote the rest of his quote.
*  It wasn't just that yes I'm down but because I don't want people to be in a panic about
*  this but I am concerned like there was a there was an additional quote.
*  He heard the quote.
*  I wasn't even to read it.
*  I heard the video.
*  You can hear it.
*  Oh let's play it.
*  Yeah it's not ours to play.
*  Oh it's Bob Woodward's.
*  It's like whoever's putting it out CNN Bob Woodward.
*  But it's it isn't the Trump's it's Trump's words.
*  It's not more tape.
*  This is where we could get into like.
*  No OK.
*  I get it.
*  I get a book right now.
*  Right.
*  So on the book Bob Woodward I'm just saying like it's all how's that guy still alive.
*  It's all confusing.
*  The Watergate guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Must be taking his vitamins.
*  How long is he.
*  How long has he got left.
*  In D.
*  How old is that dude.
*  Must be old as fuck.
*  Right.
*  Yes probably in his 40s back in back then.
*  Yeah.
*  Seven.
*  There you go.
*  So he's Biden.
*  No that's the same age.
*  Crazy.
*  It is a different time though people are living longer.
*  You know.
*  Like I know some 77 year olds that you're like look Shane my buddy his dad is like has a six pack.
*  He's pushing 70 really like Jack.
*  He's out there barefooting on the lake at like 40 miles an hour.
*  He skis every single morning.
*  And wow all his all his professional bull rider friends you know like yeah they got gnarled hands from strapping into the bulls for so long.
*  But they're still like chunky shoulders strained necks you're like dude this how old are you.
*  Look amazing you know like I'm 41 I'm looking at these guys like I'm gonna look like this when I get this age.
*  Yeah you can do that now.
*  In the old days.
*  Mike Tyson.
*  Yeah dude.
*  Listen man.
*  I had him on the podcast like 10 months ago and then I had him on the podcast last week.
*  And that's two totally different human beings.
*  Yeah that's a science project right there.
*  Really.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  But you can do that now.
*  Oh yeah you can do that now.
*  I'm telling you he looks fucking terrifying.
*  Well I mean still like ready to go.
*  How old are you.
*  53.
*  OK so I'm 41 53.
*  Do you know anybody that looked at you when you grew up.
*  That was 53.
*  No they were all dead.
*  Right.
*  They didn't they weren't Jack.
*  Yeah so like I remember 40 my dad's 40th birthday and all his 40 year old friends were there and I have to talk disparagingly about my dad's friends.
*  But you know there were beer bellies you know and guys kind of hanging out talking war stories of you know their glory days and college athletics.
*  Now you look like my friends.
*  They're all 40s and you're like pretty fit Jack.
*  Yeah Jack muscular healthy fast you know like the kids want to go play ball and they're like yeah try to keep up boy.
*  Well people know the benefit of exercise for overall health when you get older now.
*  They didn't.
*  Nobody fucking worked out in the 50s and 60s.
*  They barely worked.
*  They worked out if they're doing a sport and once they were doing a sport they didn't do shit.
*  I'm gonna be a freak till I die.
*  Yeah.
*  All the way to the grave you're like yeah what is wrong with this guy's energy why is he training so much.
*  Exactly.
*  I'm still gonna have people come to sheepdog response like this 70 year old just outshot me.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  When people talk to me about like you know what supplements you take I'm like all of them whatever works.
*  What's working.
*  Tell me what works.
*  I'll get people on tell me what's worked.
*  I'll take that.
*  Yeah what works.
*  What works.
*  I'm just trying to stay jacked.
*  I want to keep moving.
*  Yeah.
*  I want high libido.
*  I want high energy.
*  I want a ton of fun.
*  And I want people to be like how do I keep up.
*  Rage rage against the dying of the light.
*  I'm not going softly.
*  Fuck you.
*  Once more time into the fray we'll go.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think you people know what it's like to be both.
*  Either people know what it's like to be tired and weak or they know what it's like to be strong.
*  You know.
*  But when you've been both when you really when you really know where it can slide into and the only way you know that is if you've been strong.
*  And most people never really get there.
*  But when you get strong and then maybe get a little bit sick or maybe get injured and you go fuck once this ACL heals up I'm getting back after it.
*  I feel so good.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  I wasn't joking about the transformation.
*  Jamie you come to one of these courses.
*  Jamie's gonna be shooting people.
*  He's gonna be busy.
*  Can you believe you have a gun.
*  You got one right there.
*  Well I don't know about the shooting people.
*  He's ready.
*  Yeah.
*  He's ready.
*  But like you get this this contagious itch.
*  You know and like you scratch the surface and then you see what's on the other side.
*  You're like oh and then you scratch a little bit more and you see like how fun and like food tastes better sex is more fun.
*  You like work is easier.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything just gets better.
*  And then you like you then then you're in.
*  Yeah.
*  Like now you're hooked.
*  Yeah.
*  And then but that process is is like you know a calloused hand you know chunky ears.
*  Yeah.
*  But man it's worth it.
*  It's all worth it.
*  So I fucking preach it preach it preach it from the rooftops.
*  But hey get that hate out.
*  Yeah get the hate out.
*  Yeah that does not help.
*  It doesn't help anything doesn't help you either.
*  Solution oriented.
*  It's the only poison that kills the vessel that's containing it.
*  I love that.
*  Yeah it's it's fucking terrible for you.
*  And it erodes everything physically mentally.
*  And I posted a picture on Instagram and it was it was off of Andy Noe.
*  He just took all the mug shots of everybody that had been arrested.
*  They all look like shit.
*  So bad bad skin sunken eyes weird hairlines like multiple colors you know like bad tattoos.
*  Every bad thing that you could see visually about a person was and a lot of people are like they it looks like they
*  have some mental health issues.
*  And I don't know how you see mental health issues in people but there is like you don't let yourself look like that unless there's a problem.
*  Do you see the video of the woman who was saying I don't give a fuck that a fascist died tonight.
*  Jersey that video from Portland after the guy got shot and killed.
*  Bill like a pair big fat sloppy lady with fucking sweatpants on.
*  And I'm like of course you don't care.
*  You don't even care about your own body.
*  You don't care about yourself.
*  You don't care about your life.
*  You found a microphone.
*  You got a microphone now and you're yelling it out because you've got a whole bunch of other losers who'd gather together and you could say nonsense and they all cheer.
*  But I want all of those people on this side.
*  Yeah.
*  You know like I feel sorry for her.
*  I pity her.
*  I want to go take her by the hand.
*  I want to walk a couple of blocks with her.
*  I want to pick a couple of meals for her.
*  Then I want to get up the next day and walk four blocks with her and then pick a few more meals with her.
*  And then like everything starts getting better.
*  The problem is she'd have to let go and realize that she's wrong.
*  Should I like over hate.
*  Let go of hate.
*  Let go of what she's done.
*  Let go of the path.
*  Let go of what you've done with your body.
*  What you've done with your brain.
*  Let go of the path that you've been on and recognize you're a human being and you can change and learn and grow.
*  But you got to recognize this is cheering for someone who got murdered in the street.
*  You should be like this is not what we're about.
*  This is all wrong.
*  Saying I don't give a fuck of a fascist died tonight.
*  Like no that guy who you think is a fascist is a human being.
*  He might have a child.
*  He might have a wife.
*  He might.
*  He definitely has a mom and a dad.
*  This is not right.
*  This is not how we're supposed to be.
*  We're supposed to be a community.
*  America is supposed to be a community.
*  And if we disagree or we agree we're supposed to work it out.
*  We're not supposed to be shooting at each other in the streets over fucking nonsense.
*  And you're not supposed to be cheering about it with a bunch of other losers.
*  That's not what this is supposed to be about.
*  And no and no one is doing a goddamn thing about it in Portland.
*  They're just letting it go.
*  That fucking mayor is an idiot.
*  Jesus Christ is he bad.
*  I loved Portland.
*  It's amazing.
*  Ten years ago I love visiting there.
*  I was there before the pandemic.
*  I did the Moda Center there.
*  We do.
*  Great.
*  I love great food.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  They got great everything.
*  They got food trucks.
*  The people are cool.
*  We run a course there a few times a year and we always love the guys.
*  The instructors always like I want to do the Portland one because like the BNBs are
*  cool.
*  You got all the water.
*  Everything is gorgeous.
*  All the food is fantastic.
*  And like Oregon really the whole Northwest, Washington, Northern California and Oregon,
*  like they're cool people.
*  You know, they're like they're kind of kind of hippie but also kind of like about health
*  and about freedom.
*  But they're also made a little progressive in some of their social ideas.
*  But they want to be left alone.
*  So that's it's the cool people.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's a ton of fun.
*  But now we're like, can we run a course in Portland?
*  It's a small amount of people, man.
*  It's a small percentage of the millions of people that live up there.
*  It's a small, loud, angry, fucked up group of people.
*  Where the majority needs to step up.
*  And they're kind of trying.
*  They're trying.
*  You know, there's a lot of people that are very upset about what's going on and trying
*  to figure out some way to get the mayor to act or get the state police to act or get
*  someone to act.
*  It's more than 100 days of protest.
*  I love the lawsuits that are starting to pop up by business owners.
*  Yeah.
*  What was that?
*  That the district in Seattle where they're like, oh, yeah, Chad.
*  Oh, yeah, that's a bunch of people are suing the city and the state for not providing
*  the services that they had by taxes and legislation they're supposed to have.
*  So their businesses were burnt all because they're saying that the local government
*  was complicit in letting these things happen by not protecting, by not having police come
*  and say, nope, you can't do this.
*  There's a law that prohibits you from this because a guy has a cell phone and you don't
*  know who that guy is.
*  You don't get to go beat him.
*  Right.
*  Like I don't have control of this business, so I'm going to go smash the windows and burn
*  it down.
*  All those things are happening within that Chaz.
*  Like, well, there's laws against that.
*  Right.
*  That's arson and that's assault.
*  And but you guys weren't enforcing any of these.
*  So the lawsuit is that these people are complicit.
*  And it's like it's going to be one of them was a father of a murdered kid is suing the
*  pick the city, the city of Seattle for allowing that to happen.
*  Well, heavy stuff.
*  That's heavy.
*  Yeah.
*  There's rule of law for a reason.
*  Security, stability.
*  There is.
*  It's like, you know, this is a funny thing that Trump does where he tweets law and order
*  all the time.
*  You like every few days.
*  Law and order all caps.
*  But he's right.
*  You need that.
*  That's how you have safety.
*  That's how you have peace.
*  What's that?
*  The movie where you get like a night to go crazy and like the purge.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Tell me that didn't inspire a lot of these fucks.
*  It did.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, you actually see like tactics that were used in that movie being used in
*  sometimes Hollywood is more real than fiction.
*  And like that's what happened.
*  They took what they were watching.
*  I go, we can go and do this.
*  No, you can't.
*  And don't try it in Texas.
*  No, that's that's a terrible idea.
*  It's bad.
*  Especially what you're saying about all the special ops guys that are here.
*  So many enjoy the cigars.
*  They had another do is.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody loves you.
*  It's funny.
*  Thanks, man.
*  I love them too.
*  Yeah.
*  This dude, we're already more than three hours in here.
*  Holy crap.
*  Believe that.
*  How do you have a.
*  How fast did time fly?
*  No, I was looking at that school and being like that.
*  That was pretty.
*  Yeah.
*  The white tail deer I shot in Idaho or Iowa rather.
*  My friend John Dudley's property.
*  Delicious.
*  That guy ever comes around.
*  Can I just watch?
*  Yes.
*  Shoot a bow.
*  I'll have him talk to you.
*  I'll have him teach you.

*  I was just overwhelmed.
*  I would wait.
*  Well, we had to put this fucking place together.
*  I had to move in.
*  There was a lot going on.
*  We I mean, I literally decided to move and was moved in in a month.
*  That's insane.
*  Yeah.
*  So cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Bought a house in less than a month.
*  I was like, let's do it.
*  Let's go.
*  So my wife and kids ran.
*  I was like, let's fucking go out.
*  Yeah.
*  And it all coincided with the podcast moving to Spotify, which was crazy.
*  They thought it was crazy.
*  Like, what are you doing?
*  And I'm like, let's fucking party.
*  Let's have some fun.
*  Man.
