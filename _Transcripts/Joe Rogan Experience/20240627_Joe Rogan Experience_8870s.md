# Joe Rogan Experience #2027 - Oliver Anthony
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5.82s)]
*  Do you ever find yourself with the desire to welcome the crocs in your life? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=10.22s)]
*  Yeah, I've got some genuine Realtree crocs from when I'm out in the stand, you know. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=18.6s)]
*  I know guys who use those as camp shoes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  They like to walk around camping them because you're wearing heavy boots in the mountains. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=27.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, they're nice to kind of keep with you as a spare. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=30.76s)]
*  You know, you soak your boots or you're just trying to go on out of the house real quick. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=34.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=38.04s)]
*  Brian Simpson now has crocs and stage crocs. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  So before Brian Simpson goes on stage, he takes off his walk around crocs and he puts on his pristine stage crocs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=43.88s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  He used to do it with sneakers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=56.4s)]
*  He used to walk around with crocs and then he would wear sneakers on stage. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=57.48s)]
*  And then he went from crocs to stage crocs. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=60.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, maybe I'll look into that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=62.48s)]
*  I need to get some new boots. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  My boots are like, these are the ones I always wear. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=64.88s)]
*  And we were walking through the airport yesterday and they're like literally one of the souls is falling off. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=68.12s)]
*  I'm like, I got to figure out something. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=73.36s)]
*  You got to get them resold, man. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=75.2s)]
*  They're authentic. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=76.64s)]
*  Yeah, these are my genuine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=77.56s)]
*  You earned them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=79.16s)]
*  You know, people pay for those. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=80.48s)]
*  I thought about it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=82.52s)]
*  I was joking with my buddy the other day. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=83.2s)]
*  I went and changed my oil at his house before we drove to North Carolina and left the empty jug of the dirty oil sitting in his garage. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=84.92s)]
*  And I was like, I'll get it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=92.92s)]
*  Whatever. He said, no, man. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=94.0s)]
*  He said, I'm selling that on eBay. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=94.72s)]
*  That's Oliver Anthony's authentic used motor oil out of his truck. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=96.56s)]
*  You'd probably get 20 bucks for that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people that definitely would buy that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=102.48s)]
*  But what I mean, people buy used clothes because they want to wear clothes that look like, you know, they have character. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=105.28s)]
*  You know, like it drives me crazy when I buy people when I see people with pants and just shredded all over the place, like your knees are exposed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see the pro tip I have for that is just go to Goodwill. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=120.08s)]
*  You can you can get real clothes for real use. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  But that's that's extra like hipster authentic. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=125.88s)]
*  If you get if you go to a real used clothes store, what do they call those vintage vintage vintage look? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=135.6s)]
*  If you could buy some holy t-shirts and some dirty hippie wardrobe, Rolling Stones concert in the 1970s, you can get that now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=136.48s)]
*  That's worth a lot of money. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, if like he died of a heroin overdose and he kept the fucking t-shirt at his mom's house, she said, sell it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=144.92s)]
*  That's worth a lot of money. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  I've tried to hold on to things that I think I could sell down the road. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=153.04s)]
*  Look, I've still got the I've got the strings that I recorded Richmond North of Richmond on my guitar. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  I was going to I almost threw him away. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  I was like, hold on a second. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=162.04s)]
*  You could definitely in hard times. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=163.48s)]
*  Yeah, you have to sell those. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=165.0s)]
*  But that would be like an honest sale. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=167.04s)]
*  People can't say, oh, he's a sellout. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=169.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=171.11999999999998s)]
*  I'm just selling junk. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  I have actually I'm considering selling my my truck just if any. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. I think we talked about this before. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  But if somebody it's it's worthless to me, it's got three hundred and twenty five thousand miles on it and a salvage title. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=179.64s)]
*  And I still daily drive it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=185.6s)]
*  But I thought, man, if I could sell this and somebody pay 50 grand for it or whatever and send it towards a charity, like it would be it'd be pretty slick to do. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=187.16s)]
*  It has a salvage title. It does. Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  What happened to buy it when it was? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  No. Well, not paid. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=198.44s)]
*  It's a it's a 2007 suburban. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  I paid a couple grand for it years ago. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  And then just here recently, I had to have it towed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  It broke down in the rollback driver. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=209.04s)]
*  I guess I don't know if he was under the influence or something or what, but he unhooked all the chains off and then tilted the bed back. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=210.76s)]
*  So the truck rolled right off the back of the rollback. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  Oh, no. It totaled the truck out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  It bent a bunch of stuff under the drive shaft in the front of the frame and all. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=222.64s)]
*  And of course, I'm sitting there trying to figure out what to do with my truck. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=225.48s)]
*  And here comes all the police and they're like, oh, is that really you? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=228.0s)]
*  Let's get it. So I'm on the phone with my insurance company. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=230.56s)]
*  And then all these guys are coming up trying to take selfies with me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=234.56s)]
*  And that's hilarious. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=237.04s)]
*  I guess this is the world I live in now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=239.2s)]
*  So can the truck be fixed? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=241.4s)]
*  It's drivable. Yeah, I'm driving it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=244.04s)]
*  It just rides kind of like a covered wagon now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=245.44s)]
*  So it's at some point I'm going to have to upgrade. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=247.76s)]
*  Is the frame bent? Is the suspension bent? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=251.64s)]
*  Yeah, the drive shaft in the back's bent, I think is what's causing it to shake. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=253.72s)]
*  Oh, so you got like a wobbling. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=256.56s)]
*  It went straight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=257.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it went it went Dukes of Hazard style off the back of the truck. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=258.84s)]
*  That drives as an adult, that show drives me nuts. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=263.8s)]
*  Watching those cars land. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=266.48s)]
*  What are you doing to those cars? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=267.96s)]
*  Well, hey, this one can do it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=269.72s)]
*  So yeah, sort of. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=270.88s)]
*  Maybe I'll donate it to Whistle and Diesel and just let him kill it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=272.12s)]
*  I don't know. It'd be pretty slick. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=274.72s)]
*  Well, you could do that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=276.44s)]
*  Or if someone is listening to this and they want to do something cool [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=277.52s)]
*  and they've got the cheddar, buy it from you and then send it to Roadster [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=281.6s)]
*  Shop and have them put like a like a bad suspension in it and, you know, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=285.96s)]
*  make it a real sleeper. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=291.12s)]
*  They can do shit like that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=292.84s)]
*  That'd be pretty slick. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=294.16s)]
*  You have to get all that replaced anyway. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=294.96s)]
*  Why not replace it with like better shit? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  It'd be cool for somebody to have it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=298.72s)]
*  It would have a cool story behind it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=300.16s)]
*  This company called Roadster Shop, they've been on my podcast before. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=302.2s)]
*  One of the things they do is they do like a sleeper series. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=304.72s)]
*  I think they call it the Legend series. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=308.28s)]
*  I don't know. I'm actually not sure what they call it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=310.84s)]
*  But what they do is they'll take an old car. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=313.76s)]
*  So the outside looks like shit. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  The outside is patina and rust and all that stuff. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=317.52s)]
*  And then it is completely redo everything underneath it with like a crazy engine, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=319.84s)]
*  insane brakes, insane handling and suspension. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  But it still looks like, you know, 72 GMC pickup. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=328.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. But underneath it, it's just a monster. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=332.52s)]
*  It's got all the it's got all the modern amenities and because new cars are so much more [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  efficient, like you don't realize when you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=339.44s)]
*  So they do stuff like this. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=342.48s)]
*  What like that. But they have different kinds of builds. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=344.24s)]
*  No. So these are all just like the different ones that they did. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=349.84s)]
*  Survivor series. That's what it is. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=353.48s)]
*  The survivors. Well, so I think the survivor series, that's what it is. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=355.44s)]
*  Like they leave the outside. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=359.0s)]
*  It's interesting to me that older vehicles had so much more character. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=360.76s)]
*  Like, I don't know if it's just that it's people are doing drugs, bro. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=363.68s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=367.4s)]
*  We nailed it with them. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=368.92s)]
*  We sat down with them and they introduced me to all these people that were the designers [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=370.72s)]
*  back in GM in the day. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=374.44s)]
*  This guy was a freak. He was wearing like crazy red suits. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=376.36s)]
*  And this crazy guy was probably definitely on acid. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=379.32s)]
*  And these are the people that created these insane shapes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=382.32s)]
*  And then when the sweeping psychedelics drug act of 1970 came along, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=385.08000000000004s)]
*  they made everything a schedule one drug. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And that is when cars went downhill. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  It was early 70s. Yes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=392.88s)]
*  You can get a 71 Barracuda and still sick. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=395.52000000000004s)]
*  But you get into like 72, 73. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=398.6s)]
*  Those cars look like shit. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  Seventy five. They're garbage. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=403.56s)]
*  Seventy nine. They're done. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=405.0s)]
*  Everyone's on coke. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=406.56s)]
*  Everyone thinks everything they do is amazing. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  It's just you get the movie show. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  Everything lost its art and it became focused more on algorithms of what's going to sell [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=412.68s)]
*  and what's more efficient and what's easy, what's better to produce. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=417.04s)]
*  And it's sort of. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=419.64000000000004s)]
*  But back then, I don't even think they had data they were going on. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  They were going on past success. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=423.48s)]
*  So if you go to like the 1980s, some of the worst movies that were ever made, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=425.6s)]
*  like the cocaine years, those I really strongly feel like those people were going on [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=428.76000000000005s)]
*  reputations of sales. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=433.92s)]
*  And, you know, the studio would put a lot of money behind someone who had a great reputation [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=435.72s)]
*  and this guy's fucking partying and doing lines and writing crazy shit in these scripts. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=440.36s)]
*  And some of them are good and some of them aren't so good. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  But they're all kind of clunky. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  They're all kind of disconnected. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=450.0s)]
*  That like a true masterpiece of a movie isn't, you know, like Taxi Driver. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=451.92s)]
*  Like you go back and watch Taxi Driver. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=457.08s)]
*  That's a masterpiece of a movie. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=458.6s)]
*  It's so connected. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=460.8s)]
*  You're connected to all the action. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=462.04s)]
*  It's like you're on the edge of your seat. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=464.04s)]
*  It's it's wild. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=466.0s)]
*  The acting is insane. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=467.6s)]
*  Even Jodie Foster as a kid is insane. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=469.6s)]
*  And it's so good. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=472.12s)]
*  But cocaine movies in the 80s, they just they're just they were nuts, man. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=474.04s)]
*  They they didn't go on algorithms. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=479.76s)]
*  I think they just went on what they thought people wanted. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=481.76s)]
*  They probably took polls. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=486.44s)]
*  But who the fuck's answering polls? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=487.48s)]
*  Polls are the worst way to get information because you're only getting information from [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=489.08s)]
*  people dumb enough to answer polls. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=492.48s)]
*  Like that's such a small group of people. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=494.68s)]
*  How many people answer polls when they call you up? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=497.28s)]
*  How many people have fucking people with a life have time for a poll? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=500.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, do you think Jordan Peterson has ever answered a poll? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=504.12s)]
*  Yeah, like I always get those calls and immediately hang up. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=506.88s)]
*  Yeah, just shut the fuck up. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=510.24s)]
*  I'm sorry I have to do this to you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=512.12s)]
*  But bye. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=513.4s)]
*  No, don't hang up. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=514.4s)]
*  So I'll beg. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=515.48s)]
*  Please. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=517.12s)]
*  It's it's anybody to do it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=518.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's fascinating to see throughout history times when people were able to really [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=519.72s)]
*  connect with other humans like on that, like whether it's the movie or film or cars or [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=523.32s)]
*  whatever, it's like maybe it was the psychedelics or whatever. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=527.12s)]
*  I don't know. But there was a huge disconnect, it seemed like after the 70s with all that, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=529.76s)]
*  things kind of went off. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=535.08s)]
*  And it's interesting even now, like I see a lot of the new a lot of the new movies coming [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=535.96s)]
*  out, they're all just sort of remakes of they're just like a they're like a reconciplization [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=539.32s)]
*  of something that's happened 15 years ago. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=543.24s)]
*  There's not a lot of like new stuff out there for people to connect with. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Matt Damon did this conversation about why it's so much more difficult to make movies [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=548.88s)]
*  now. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=553.0s)]
*  There's no DVD sales anymore. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=554.0s)]
*  And it was very interesting. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=555.0s)]
*  And it kind of makes sense. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=556.0s)]
*  I think it's just it's really hard to finance those fucking things. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=557.44s)]
*  And you want a guaranteed success. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=560.6s)]
*  What's a guaranteed success? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=562.7600000000001s)]
*  You need a superhero. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=563.7600000000001s)]
*  People like superheroes, you know, and if your superhero is trans, even better. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=565.2s)]
*  You could figure out a way to make every ethnicity inside the group of superheroes that are there. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=570.64s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=576.36s)]
*  Now we're good. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=577.36s)]
*  Now we need CGI, we need aliens, explosions. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=578.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think CGI is a blessing and a curse because like, I don't know, some of the best [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=580.8s)]
*  some of the best film, it doesn't necessarily have the best stunts or the you know, like, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=586.08s)]
*  you can tell where some of its fabricated, but that's okay, because the whole you know [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=590.88s)]
*  the whole thing is a fabrication going into it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=594.48s)]
*  It's just about like being able to believe the story within it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=596.24s)]
*  That's what's important, you know, even like I'm not a huge movie guy. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=599.24s)]
*  And I guess I'm it's it's difficult for me to sit three hours and watch something straight. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=602.6s)]
*  My mind's already long gone within the first 30 minutes doing something else. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=607.52s)]
*  But Star Wars was really partial to me growing up. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=611.0s)]
*  And I don't think they'll ever touch the original series, even though, yeah, like you can tell [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=614.28s)]
*  some of it like it even with some of the like the the renovations they've done on the newer [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=618.48s)]
*  versions of it, like to make to adding CGI into the old films. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=623.8s)]
*  It's like just the story of the originals to me meant a lot more than the old than the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=627.56s)]
*  newer stuff just because of the you don't believe it looking at it with your eyes as [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=631.24s)]
*  much as you believe it more with your with your mind, like listening to what it has to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=635.0s)]
*  tell you, you know. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=638.6s)]
*  I think that Star Wars is like generational wealth, like the original guy who started [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=639.64s)]
*  the company was a bad motherfucker. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=647.08s)]
*  That guy was out there grinding. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=649.08s)]
*  He was selling soap out of the back of a wagon in 1890. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=651.24s)]
*  But the folks who inherited the company, three, four and five generations in, they're kind [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=655.72s)]
*  of flat. There's not there's it's different. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=662.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, when I watch Star Wars now, it's like a bunch of stuff happening. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  It's still fun. They're still good. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=669.1600000000001s)]
*  I enjoy them. Yeah. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=670.84s)]
*  But Star Wars won in the context of whatever year it was. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=672.0400000000001s)]
*  What was it? 77 or something like that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=675.4000000000001s)]
*  Hey, there you go. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=677.2800000000001s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=679.6s)]
*  What's first? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=680.48s)]
*  If you had to guess. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=681.88s)]
*  Yeah, probably late 70s. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=682.7600000000001s)]
*  I'd say. Yeah, I want to say like 70s in my unprofessional opinion. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=684.0400000000001s)]
*  Am I right? 77? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=686.5200000000001s)]
*  Yay. Look at that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=687.2800000000001s)]
*  That movie at that time was fucking groundbreaking. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=688.9200000000001s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=693.96s)]
*  Rick Baker did the special effects. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=695.8000000000001s)]
*  That was when I was a serious special effects nerd. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=697.44s)]
*  Like I wanted to do when I was a little kid, I wanted to do special effects for the movies. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=700.12s)]
*  That's how I became a giant fan of Rick Baker. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=703.9200000000001s)]
*  That's why we have that American Werewolf in London in the lobby. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, OK. That's what that's. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=708.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. OK. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=709.28s)]
*  This guy named Pat McGee. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=710.16s)]
*  It's funny because that's our second one. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=711.08s)]
*  We have another one that's in the pool hall. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  And the reason why is that Pat McGee, who is this amazing special effects guy, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=714.44s)]
*  he was also on the podcast back in the day. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=719.68s)]
*  He made an American Werewolf in London you could buy online. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=722.24s)]
*  And I'm like, that would be the sickest thing for the studio ever. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=726.68s)]
*  And then Rick Baker came and was a guest. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=729.72s)]
*  And Rick Baker said the proportions are off like the wolf. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=732.88s)]
*  The arms weren't as long. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=736.28s)]
*  It was like shorter was like this. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=737.68s)]
*  So Pat McGee listened and he was like, shit, I got to make a better one. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  And so he made an even better one. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=743.0s)]
*  And the new one is all hair. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=744.52s)]
*  There's no synthetic hair. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=747.04s)]
*  So it's all like I think it's yak hair that they use. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  So it's like individual hairs are put in all over this wolf. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=751.0s)]
*  And it looks fucking amazing. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=755.2399999999999s)]
*  It does look. Yeah, that's the first thing that catches your eye walking in here. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=756.88s)]
*  I'd say out of everything. Yeah, that thing's sick. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=759.92s)]
*  You're not going to find one of those many other places. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  That was my 100 percent my favorite horror movie. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=764.04s)]
*  I love that movie because it's funny. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=770.4399999999999s)]
*  It has to do with the werewolf theme to me is so amazing that you take some person [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=772.16s)]
*  who's like a good person. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=776.88s)]
*  They're a friendly, nice guy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=778.2399999999999s)]
*  And you're like, hey, man, you have to lock yourself in a cage. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=780.4s)]
*  You're going to become a monster. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=783.4799999999999s)]
*  It's like, what the fuck are you saying? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=784.4799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=786.2399999999999s)]
*  And no one they never want to believe. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=787.52s)]
*  And you know, is it going to happen? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=789.0799999999999s)]
*  And in that one, that was the first time in one of those movies [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=790.64s)]
*  where you got to see like the advancements of special effects. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=794.4s)]
*  Like what year was American werewolf in London? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=798.2s)]
*  Let's guess that. I want to say 82. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=799.84s)]
*  I'm going to say 82, 84. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=804.28s)]
*  81, 81. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=808.72s)]
*  I just stuck with 82. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  Back then, when, you know, you had special effects, it was like kind of like [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=813.24s)]
*  they didn't move that good, like they couldn't get their faces to move that good. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=817.88s)]
*  But he had figured out a way to get your hands to grow like. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=821.52s)]
*  And he had to figure out a way to get things in his cheeks [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=827.08s)]
*  where his cheeks were bubbling. Yeah. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=829.64s)]
*  And it's awesome. All real. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=831.28s)]
*  None of it is CGI. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=833.52s)]
*  It's and there's something about that uncanny valley. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=835.04s)]
*  When you're watching a CGI transformation, your brain knows it's bullshit. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=838.4s)]
*  For whatever reason, you're better off having it look fake, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=843.48s)]
*  but be a real thing like John Carpenter's The Thing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=847.2s)]
*  You're better off with that than you are with CGI. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=850.8s)]
*  Yeah. For whatever reason, CGI. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=854.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think we just have seen. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=855.88s)]
*  There it is. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=857.36s)]
*  This is behind the scenes footage I always want to show you. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=859.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=861.6s)]
*  Because it still moves in an interesting way. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=862.8s)]
*  Yeah. But that's a physical thing moving. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=865.36s)]
*  It's not a CGI that does look exactly like the wolf in the lobby, doesn't it? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=868.48s)]
*  So but back then, they couldn't even get the thing to close its mouth. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=873.12s)]
*  Look how sick that is. That's awesome. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  Imagine if you're in a subway and you see that fucking thing turning a corner. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=878.36s)]
*  Oh, my God. That scene was amazing [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=882.88s)]
*  where the poor guy was stuck in the subway and he was running from it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=885.72s)]
*  And then you see it at the bottom of the escalator stairs. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=889.08s)]
*  That's that's like [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=891.5600000000001s)]
*  just those quick glimpses of a thing like that is so much more terrifying [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=894.64s)]
*  than some long CGI up monster killing someone scene. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=899.52s)]
*  Like the American War of London was just a masterpiece. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=904.08s)]
*  Atlantis just nailed it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=906.92s)]
*  It was the perfect horror movie. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=909.64s)]
*  And it was funny. It's like there's funny moments in it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=911.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool. And you can add you can you can get humor in there, too. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=913.36s)]
*  Yeah, that that that kind of reminds me my dog when I don't give him table scraps. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=916.28s)]
*  You know, he's got that terrible, terrible face like that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=920.0799999999999s)]
*  That thing was amazing. Yeah. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=924.16s)]
*  But it's just the difference between digital and real. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=926.04s)]
*  And you're going to have to deal with that soon, because I guarantee you [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=929.7199999999999s)]
*  there's going to be some people that are making some CGI. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, there are already. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=934.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I'm sure. What is that? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=936.08s)]
*  I'm sure there are. Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=937.64s)]
*  I haven't kept up with a lot just because, you know, I'm doing. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=938.84s)]
*  So anything social media related right now or anything, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=942.88s)]
*  any Internet presence I have right now is coming from me off the phone [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=946.24s)]
*  just like before everything blew up. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=949.44s)]
*  So I haven't invested the time to like look at everything circulating. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=951.12s)]
*  But I've people like friends and family have sent me stuff. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=954.96s)]
*  And some of it's pretty funny. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=957.6s)]
*  But, you know, they've got all these different [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=958.76s)]
*  AI remixes of the song with different voices and [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=961.0s)]
*  overlay different faces and all. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=964.56s)]
*  And it's it's funny to see where it's going to go. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=966.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, that is funny. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=968.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You're going to have to deal with that. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=970.16s)]
*  My daughter sent me some advertisement. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=971.92s)]
*  She goes, did you do this advertisement? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=973.9599999999999s)]
*  Mike, nope. Yeah. That's not really my voice. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=975.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Like the day after the day after things blew up, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=977.92s)]
*  one of the towing companies had had an ad on Facebook that had it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=980.56s)]
*  It wasn't really me, but it was a red beard and like the side profile [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=984.28s)]
*  of sunglasses looking out the window. I'm like, OK, how dare you? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=987.7199999999999s)]
*  I guess I've made it anyway. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=990.5999999999999s)]
*  That's when I realized, like people are already ripping things off. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=991.88s)]
*  And what's crazy is like every shirt that I've worn anywhere in public. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=994.56s)]
*  There's so there's a there's a organization that I've [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=998.36s)]
*  I'm not like officially related to or in any way have done anything with. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1002.68s)]
*  But it's a friend of a friend in the neighborhood. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1006.72s)]
*  It's called Nets with Vets. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1008.52s)]
*  And they take out veterans with PTSD and let them go deep sea fishing. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1009.64s)]
*  And so he asked me last minute just to wear his shirt at one of the concerts. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1013.32s)]
*  And, you know, now there's like 1500 listings online for counterfeit. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1017.4s)]
*  Nets with Vets shirts. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1021.24s)]
*  And so the organization reached out like, hey, are you like making shirts? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1022.92s)]
*  Ripping us off? It's like it's not me. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1026.32s)]
*  So it's like it's a weird it's a weird thing. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1029.32s)]
*  But I've I've already experienced a lot of that stuff, not so much on the AI side, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1031.28s)]
*  but just I don't know. The Internet's just such a rowdy place, you know. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1034.84s)]
*  Oh, it's so rowdy. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1038.2s)]
*  The world's a rowdy place. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1040.16s)]
*  It is. And maybe people bring maybe people bring their [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1042.0s)]
*  their best and their worst on the Internet. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1045.8s)]
*  Like, I've always tried to stay off social media as much as possible. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1047.48s)]
*  But I've learned very quickly that like Twitter and Facebook and stuff like you, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1051.56s)]
*  you see comments and feedback from people, both overwhelmingly positive [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1057.2s)]
*  that maybe you wouldn't get in a personal conversation, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1060.8s)]
*  but also like overwhelmingly negative. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1063.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, yeah. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1065.2s)]
*  People just use that as a vent that just they just take whatever seething [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1066.4s)]
*  hatred they have inside of them. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1069.96s)]
*  They're like, oh, I'm getting that guy with it. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1071.24s)]
*  If you had a song just about love that resonated like that, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1073.48s)]
*  it would be almost impossible to hate you. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1078.68s)]
*  But you have a song where you're talking about how people are fed up with shit [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1081.1200000000001s)]
*  and it obviously resonated. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1085.2s)]
*  I mean, I've seen songs go viral, but that's pretty banana, son. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1088.7600000000002s)]
*  Your shit went to the moon right away. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1094.0400000000002s)]
*  And God, I'm not sure who sent it to me. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  I have to find out who sent it to me. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1100.0800000000002s)]
*  Because it's one of those things where like once one person sent it to me, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1102.6s)]
*  then it was like dozens of people were saying, yeah, it it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1105.48s)]
*  It's funny, because originally that song wasn't in my. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1109.56s)]
*  It wasn't really even in my top five. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1113.1999999999998s)]
*  Like, it's not normally the type of song. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1115.24s)]
*  I've written songs with similar messages. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1117.48s)]
*  But as far as that sort of like, I guess, anthem format is what people are calling. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1119.76s)]
*  It's like an anthem. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1123.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, that's not something I would normally write. But. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1123.9599999999998s)]
*  But it's an unlikely anthem. Yeah. Insane times. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1127.12s)]
*  It would be an unlikely anthem. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1131.68s)]
*  Yeah, I had no idea that that song would react the way it did. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1133.24s)]
*  Well, you're a smart guy and it's representative of how a lot of people feel. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1136.1200000000001s)]
*  And it's also there's something about the way certain people sing. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1140.5600000000002s)]
*  And I don't know what it is because I can't sing. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1144.52s)]
*  But there's a there's a tone, there's an authentic sound. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1146.92s)]
*  And I know when they're faking it. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1150.88s)]
*  And it's not that they're not faking it in a beautiful way. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1152.88s)]
*  Like, there's a lot of people. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1155.1200000000001s)]
*  The faking is probably a bad term, but they're sounding perfect. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1156.16s)]
*  And they're singing a song. There's something missing. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1160.6s)]
*  I don't know what it is. Yeah. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1163.48s)]
*  But some people like Janis Joplin's like one of my greatest examples. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1164.76s)]
*  There's an take a little piece of my heart. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  There's a authenticity in that voice. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1171.1599999999999s)]
*  That God damn, man, if that doesn't bring you to your knees, play that, play that. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1176.0s)]
*  We need to hear that. We got time. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1180.84s)]
*  This fucking song. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1183.6399999999999s)]
*  I always got every time. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1185.24s)]
*  This is one of those songs that every time I hear it, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1186.76s)]
*  it just takes me in my mind to what it must have been like to be alive in 1968 [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1189.96s)]
*  or whenever it was that this came out. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1197.84s)]
*  And this hippie chick who's 27 years old. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1201.68s)]
*  Yeah. Has a voice from the heaven. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1206.44s)]
*  God damn, son. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1209.32s)]
*  Listen to that. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1220.28s)]
*  Oh, it's so fine. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1223.12s)]
*  Yes, it's timeless to like. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1226.3600000000001s)]
*  She was a magical person. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1250.4s)]
*  Yeah, magical person. It's a magical. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1252.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, she's really singing with everything in her like there's it's. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1255.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think at least in my case, I think the one thing that's helped me to is it. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1259.6s)]
*  My singing isn't the best, but I've never had any like vocal lessons or anything. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1265.44s)]
*  So the way I sing is just the way I sing. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1268.92s)]
*  And so like I think even the same way with her and other people, it's like [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1270.96s)]
*  it's maybe rough around the edges. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1273.84s)]
*  It could be a little pitchy or it's, you know, you're not using the right [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1275.56s)]
*  part of your face when you project and whatever. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1278.72s)]
*  And so like on paper, things aren't quite right. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1281.0s)]
*  But to the I guess to another human, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1282.96s)]
*  it's like it sounds like it sounds right, because it's it's it is it is what it is. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1284.8s)]
*  You know, it's authentic. Yeah. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1288.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think there's any right way to do anything. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1290.52s)]
*  I mean, there's like you see it in everything. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1293.68s)]
*  There's a person who violates the rules and they're the best at it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1298.2s)]
*  And then and then the rules almost morph into whatever that is. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1302.76s)]
*  Like it's funny, like with music. Yeah, music is. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1305.56s)]
*  Country in particular, but music in general has gotten way too [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1310.36s)]
*  wrapped up in like this algorithm of how many beats per minute it needs to have [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1313.2s)]
*  and how many verses and how they need to be layered. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1317.1200000000001s)]
*  And it's like they've almost created this sort of like industry standard [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1319.52s)]
*  like OSHA rulebook of how music needs to be performed. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1323.68s)]
*  And so like you can only do that so many thousands of times before people are like, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1326.4s)]
*  OK, what else is there? You know, well, people like that, too. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1329.8400000000001s)]
*  That's the thing. There's a lot of damn people. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1333.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1335.2s)]
*  The problem, I think a lot of people is they want you to like what they like. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1336.52s)]
*  And if you don't like what they like, well, you like socks. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1342.2s)]
*  It's it's funny like that, man. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1346.04s)]
*  It's we we're so tribal. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1348.52s)]
*  We we are we are tribal with our cell phones. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1350.32s)]
*  You know, we're an Android or PC, you know, all about brands together. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1353.8400000000001s)]
*  It's like we're so weird. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1357.88s)]
*  We're so weird. But we're like that with our musical taste. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1360.28s)]
*  We're like that with our cultural sensitivities or our cultural sensibilities rather. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1363.1200000000001s)]
*  Like the way we feel about life and how life should be. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1370.64s)]
*  We want everybody to kind of think along the ways that we think. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1373.52s)]
*  It's very strange. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1376.4s)]
*  And when a person like yourself gets labeled a right wing, left wing fanatic, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1377.68s)]
*  like right out of the gate, both in both in like a week and a half. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1382.32s)]
*  And yeah, at least I know I'm doing something right. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1385.32s)]
*  Like to me, yeah, they're looking for your Biden campaign contributions now. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1387.28s)]
*  They're going through your fucking taxes. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1392.0800000000002s)]
*  The whole thing is so bonkers, man. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1394.72s)]
*  Like, can't they just accept that you made a great song and people enjoy it? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1396.3600000000001s)]
*  Why does it have you know, why do people have to attack? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1399.64s)]
*  Well, I think it's just for whatever reason, I've been there's [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1402.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm the subject matter the last couple of weeks and I and you know, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1405.2s)]
*  in everyone's defense, I probably haven't. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1409.0s)]
*  I've waited for this opportunity, I guess, to really have a real conversation [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1411.88s)]
*  with somebody about whatever it is I am. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1416.04s)]
*  So people are just trying to find [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1417.76s)]
*  who's this Oliver Anthony guy and what is he and where does he work [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1420.28s)]
*  and who did he vote for and what's his family like and yadi? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1423.48s)]
*  Because they want to sort of build this [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1426.6s)]
*  image of whatever it is that the person behind the song [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1429.24s)]
*  represents for better or for worse, people who agree with it want to, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1431.6799999999998s)]
*  you know, I don't know. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1435.24s)]
*  It's really funny to watch on my end, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1436.76s)]
*  because obviously I know what's true and what's not. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1438.9599999999998s)]
*  And so like just even what I've skimmed through of people sending me like [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1441.08s)]
*  like this, like singing at the Super Bowl, like how many people [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1445.56s)]
*  have formed an opinion about whether or not I should be paid to sing at the Super Bowl? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1448.7199999999998s)]
*  Like, I'm not singing at the Super Bowl. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1451.6799999999998s)]
*  That's just somebody made up. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1453.32s)]
*  But, you know, there's there's been hundreds of hours of people's time [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1455.72s)]
*  wasted probably talking about all these little like things that don't even exist. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1458.5600000000002s)]
*  It's just somebody made him up and put him on the Internet. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1461.96s)]
*  And so I'm just letting him ride. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1463.8s)]
*  I think I think it's I think it's great. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1465.6000000000001s)]
*  I just think it's great. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1468.24s)]
*  Like that at least the last couple of weeks, I've been able to entertain everyone [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1469.2s)]
*  and get everyone's mind off, like all the all the other horrible stuff [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1472.8400000000001s)]
*  that's going on in the world right now. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1475.88s)]
*  Like at least everybody can have a good laugh, you know. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1477.3200000000002s)]
*  So, well, I mean, it's it's a subject of discussion. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1480.5600000000002s)]
*  So like everybody is getting involved and somehow or another became cultural. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1484.6s)]
*  And then there was Dwight from the office. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1489.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He chimed in that if he was going to write a cultural anthem, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1491.76s)]
*  what did he say? Something like he wouldn't write about overweight people on welfare. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1496.24s)]
*  He would write about billionaires and their taxes. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1501.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there is nothing funnier than millionaires talking shit about billionaires. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1503.8s)]
*  There is nothing funny, funnier about millionaires [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1509.1999999999998s)]
*  pretending these billionaires are out of touch. Oh, yeah. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1512.16s)]
*  And then, you know, take take Dwight from the office down to West Virginia. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1515.96s)]
*  You know, take him take him through those coal mining countries. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1520.28s)]
*  Take him through those places in Appalachia where people have extreme poverty. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1523.28s)]
*  Yeah. And pills have ravished those areas. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1527.8400000000001s)]
*  Take him through there. And it's everywhere. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1531.16s)]
*  Yeah. The sad thing is it's it's everywhere now. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1532.88s)]
*  It's not. Yeah. You know, it's funny, people right off the get go, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1534.68s)]
*  I guess because it was Radio WV that posted the original video. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1537.52s)]
*  But like I've never once advertised myself as being necessarily from the mountains. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1540.6s)]
*  My grandfather grew up in western part of Virginia, the mountains. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1545.3999999999999s)]
*  But I'm from Farmville, which is technically Piedmont. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1548.3999999999999s)]
*  But even in throughout rural Virginia, that poverty is a big issue and drugs are a big issue. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1551.4399999999998s)]
*  And I mean, it's not just even in the rural areas. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1556.52s)]
*  And you go into downtown Richmond or any downtown anywhere for that matter. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1558.6s)]
*  It's like it's almost like, yeah, these problems exist everywhere now. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1562.04s)]
*  And I think, I mean, obviously they are, because that's why the song resonated [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1565.8s)]
*  the way it did, you know, even in other countries and other countries. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1568.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, people are tired of being fucked with. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1571.96s)]
*  And it seems like people in power are always fucking with people. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1575.16s)]
*  And it's I think it's a natural inclination that human beings have. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1578.32s)]
*  And I think the founding fathers of this country recognize that when they set up our government, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1581.8s)]
*  they set up our government to protect it against tyranny. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1585.64s)]
*  And they did it by having all these different branches of government. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1588.3600000000001s)]
*  And they're all coordinated. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1591.2s)]
*  And there's a lot of fucking a lot of stuff that keeps people from just running it [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1592.52s)]
*  the way they want to run it like a king. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1596.8s)]
*  Well, they they I mean, I'm certainly no I'm no professional historian. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1598.84s)]
*  But my understanding is that the federal government was never intended to be the size that it is today. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1603.1999999999998s)]
*  Like it's just we've we're we're very top heavy in the way we're structured. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1607.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, our federal government is enormous and out of control and almost impossible to manage. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1613.0s)]
*  But then like our our on our community level and in our state government, things are [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1617.72s)]
*  especially local government, things are just [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1623.04s)]
*  very neglected and weak and disconnected. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1626.08s)]
*  And so like that's why you see a lot of the problems like we shouldn't have to rely on the federal [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1628.24s)]
*  government to fix things out in the street in small town America, like the communities in the local [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1632.64s)]
*  government should be the ones fixing that. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1637.52s)]
*  And that's that's the way I see things like even before the even before our current form of [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1639.28s)]
*  government. I remember reading about like articles of confederation. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1644.6s)]
*  And that was just an even smaller version of federal government. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1647.4s)]
*  And it needed to have a little more structure than that. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1650.24s)]
*  But even from day one, it seems like the federal government's never supposed to be the size that it's [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1652.28s)]
*  gotten to. Like that's really. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1657.28s)]
*  That's a good argument if the country didn't get to the size that it got. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1658.68s)]
*  The problem is you can't have like 30 people running. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1663.24s)]
*  Well, no, you can't. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1666.92s)]
*  Billion people. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1668.0s)]
*  I think you could have more issues. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1668.84s)]
*  So like I just I think it's almost impossible. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1670.6399999999999s)]
*  It's almost impossible for states to be able to have the control to make the right decisions for the [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1675.32s)]
*  people in their areas when the federal government limits them in so many different ways. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1681.08s)]
*  I don't know anything about this, so I'm going to be talking out of my ass. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1685.2800000000002s)]
*  But I would imagine. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1687.92s)]
*  Hey, look, I am low on funding, too. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1688.8400000000001s)]
*  There's probably a lot of issues, especially in places that are poor because they they rely on taxes from [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1690.92s)]
*  those people. It's it's all very complicated. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1695.24s)]
*  But the idea of taxing the rich being the way to fix all this. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1698.1200000000001s)]
*  No, you're just going to give more money than the government. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1700.96s)]
*  And they're not really good at doing stuff. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1702.92s)]
*  You know, I mean, would it be nice if rich people donated to fixing streets and schools and stuff like [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1704.68s)]
*  that? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, it would be good. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1710.8000000000002s)]
*  Good call. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1713.2800000000002s)]
*  Also, fat people shouldn't be buying fucking fudge rounds with food stamps. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1714.04s)]
*  Yeah. So that's not. Yeah. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1720.04s)]
*  And that's and that's that's a funny. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1721.2s)]
*  But also that's a conversation that sort of got blown multiple ways. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1723.92s)]
*  And really, I I like to let a song be left up to interpretation of the listener. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1728.04s)]
*  But even with that, it's like, yeah, I would love to write a song about like I always thought it was [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1732.44s)]
*  funny, just like when GM got bailed out of the recession after they made all these terrible decisions. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1737.24s)]
*  Like, I never understood why we I don't I've never understood corporate welfare either to much of an [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1741.76s)]
*  extent. So I do understand the people making that argument. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1746.52s)]
*  Well, the corporate welfare argument is you're going to lose a shitload of jobs. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1748.88s)]
*  You can preserve those jobs, give those people a loan. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1752.08s)]
*  They build back up and they repay the loan. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1754.16s)]
*  That's what they did, though. Yeah. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1756.24s)]
*  So there's actually some benefit to that. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1757.72s)]
*  So, yeah, there's American jobs and it also keeps one of the most iconic American car manufacturers in [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1760.04s)]
*  business. That's good for everybody. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1765.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a good it's it's a good conversation to have. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1767.44s)]
*  Like it is like what gets bailed out and what doesn't. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1770.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Why? Yeah. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1773.36s)]
*  Yeah. But ultimately, yeah, I do see a lot of people that aren't taken care of. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1774.72s)]
*  Yeah. And so, you know, the most used business that didn't get taken care of during the crash. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1779.6399999999999s)]
*  The porn business, the porn business got wrecked. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1786.32s)]
*  They got wrecked because they used to rely on DVD sales and then internet pirating came along and they lost [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1791.24s)]
*  everything. And meanwhile, these politicians are probably whacking off every day to them. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1797.52s)]
*  That's a big industry even today. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1802.16s)]
*  Oh, for sure. For sure. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1804.36s)]
*  Well, hey, for whatever they lost during the recession, they made it back during COVID because that's my [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1806.04s)]
*  understanding. Everyone was doing that then. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1810.0s)]
*  So I don't know how that works. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1811.84s)]
*  Like who's getting paid? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1813.92s)]
*  I don't know how that works. I'm sure there's a lot of money in that business. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1815.12s)]
*  There's obviously a lot of eyeballs in that business. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1817.72s)]
*  I believe it's one third of internet traffic worldwide or something bonkers like that. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1820.12s)]
*  Yeah. Isn't it something like that? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1824.72s)]
*  It should be more. Let's find out what it is. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1827.56s)]
*  What's the percentage of what everybody's like? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1829.68s)]
*  I don't know where it's coming from. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1831.36s)]
*  It's not me. I've never even seen one of these films. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1833.4s)]
*  That stuff's terrible for people. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1837.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's terrible for some people. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1839.6399999999999s)]
*  I gave that up. I think it's like Adderall. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1841.28s)]
*  Yeah. Some people can handle it. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1843.52s)]
*  That's one thing. That is one thing I had to give up. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1845.08s)]
*  Yeah, because it's, I don't know, it does disconnect you from reality in many ways. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1848.84s)]
*  I think a lot of the weird perversion we see coming out, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1854.16s)]
*  sort of like now at this point you read about, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1858.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean I even reference some of it in the song of course, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1860.48s)]
*  but you read about a lot of the weird things that people are doing [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1862.8s)]
*  that maybe wouldn't have been accepted 100 years ago. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1865.24s)]
*  I think people go down these rabbit holes with porn and they start off, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1867.3600000000001s)]
*  they start off with the video with the milkman and by the end of it, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1872.2s)]
*  it's like, where did I end? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1874.8s)]
*  I don't know. People have to keep, it's almost like a drug. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1876.1200000000001s)]
*  People have to keep chasing that thrill and it takes them down very destructive rabbit holes, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1878.16s)]
*  you know, if you will. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1882.6399999999999s)]
*  So it definitely can for some people. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1883.3999999999999s)]
*  I have no issue with anybody watching it, but I do hate the, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1885.44s)]
*  I hate to read about some of the things that it does to people. It affect, you know, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1888.3999999999999s)]
*  ruins marriages and that kind of thing. It's like, I don't know, but. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1891.6799999999998s)]
*  I think a lot of things ruin people. I do. I think they also should be legal. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1895.0s)]
*  Like alcohol ruins people. I like the fact that bars are legal. Shit, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1900.04s)]
*  I own a bar. Alcohol is legal. I like it. It's good. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1904.84s)]
*  It's not good for everybody though. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1909.32s)]
*  Some people drink alcohol and they lose their fucking mind and it's not good for them, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1910.52s)]
*  whether it's genetically or whatever it is. They can't have a drink. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1914.2s)]
*  I like a drink. You know, and I support your right to do whatever you want. Like, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1918.4s)]
*  you know, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1923.2s)]
*  I think if cocaine was legal, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1925.28s)]
*  the same amount of people would probably do it and it would be real. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1928.3600000000001s)]
*  You'd get pure cocaine. It'd probably better. We'd probably have better music. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1931.48s)]
*  If you're getting this fentanyl mixed shit and you're out of your fucking head. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1936.32s)]
*  Yeah, well that's the problem. Like, yeah, I mean, gosh, yeah. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1941.6s)]
*  Look at when the government banned something, it only makes it worse. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1943.72s)]
*  So that's certainly not the answer. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1946.2s)]
*  I'm not interested in Adderall. I'm interested in trying it once, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1947.92s)]
*  but I'm not interested in like doing Adderall. I am interested. I'm lying. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1950.48s)]
*  I'm interested because everybody loves it. But I'm scared of it. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1955.76s)]
*  The porn stats, you're right about 30%, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1958.72s)]
*  but this is the only one I find to be odd. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1960.72s)]
*  In 2020 16.5 years was the average age of first exposure to porn in the United [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1963.96s)]
*  States. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  16 and a half. That's like, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1969.68s)]
*  that's because 90 year old people are still alive and they do it based on them. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1971.3600000000001s)]
*  I first saw my girly movie when I was 20. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1976.04s)]
*  Frank had a reel to reel camera in the basement. We all got there. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1979.76s)]
*  We had, we had raincoats on. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1984.96s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1987.92s)]
*  It's like when you factor in infant mortality to the average age that people [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1988.76s)]
*  die during the Roman era. That's what it is. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1993.76s)]
*  So you expect it to be lower than 16 and a half? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1995.92s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it should be. Yeah, it should be. You give a kid a phone. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=1998.04s)]
*  Now, instantly they, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2001.5600000000002s)]
*  I know that was one thing that was interesting to me in Virginia. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2002.92s)]
*  They just recently changed the law where I think you have to enter your [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2005.5600000000002s)]
*  driver's license to watch porn now. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2008.1200000000001s)]
*  Hilarious. Now they know exactly who's watching porn. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2010.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, that's good if you're watching some freak shit. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2012.96s)]
*  You know, it's like, I don't know, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2015.12s)]
*  you don't want to give the government the ability to spy on you. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2017.1999999999998s)]
*  You just don't. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2020.1999999999998s)]
*  And you don't want to give, because the government is just humans. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2021.08s)]
*  We like to think of the government as being some all powerful, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2024.32s)]
*  all moral, all ethical entity that controls us in a perfect and very robust [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2027.56s)]
*  and well considered way. But that's not real. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2033.56s)]
*  The reality is it's shit. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2036.12s)]
*  It's shit. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2038.32s)]
*  It's shit. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2039.1599999999999s)]
*  It's shit. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2040.0s)]
*  It's shit. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2040.84s)]
*  It's shit. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2041.6799999999998s)]
*  It's shit. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2042.52s)]
*  The reality is it's human beings like you and like me and like Jamie, people, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2043.3999999999999s)]
*  people that get to dictate what other people can and can't do. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2049.12s)]
*  And that's where shit gets weird. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2052.44s)]
*  And a lot of people, I think, go into government with good intentions, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2054.0s)]
*  but it's like anything else. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2056.96s)]
*  Once I think you get in the mix, it's like things change and you have to, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2058.08s)]
*  you have to go with the flow and sort of agree to agree on things that maybe [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2063.0s)]
*  your heart doesn't necessarily agree with. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2066.68s)]
*  And so that's why you see politicians constantly changing narratives, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2068.56s)]
*  depending on like the political climate. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2072.48s)]
*  And so, yeah, it's kind of created this big disconnect between people like you [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2074.28s)]
*  and I and people like you and I that are in government because they're not [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2077.96s)]
*  they're not necessarily saying what they feel or what they think. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2081.32s)]
*  They're like, let me keep my stripes just like everybody else's. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2083.76s)]
*  So I don't stand out. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2087.04s)]
*  You know, like, yes, there's a lot of that. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2088.16s)]
*  There's a lot of there's too much money tied up in politics, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2090.2400000000002s)]
*  too much bribe and extortion and and and and slap slap on the back deals [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2093.8s)]
*  and stuff that should never be allowed to happen. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2099.04s)]
*  Like, yeah, that's what's really created a lot of dishonesty within it. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2101.04s)]
*  There's a bunch of decisions that got made a long time ago that really fucked us. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2105.52s)]
*  And one of them was when they let drug companies advertise on television. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2109.2s)]
*  That's like there's only two countries in the world that allow that. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2114.2s)]
*  Really? The United States and New Zealand. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2116.96s)]
*  Yeah. And I think it was 97. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2119.12s)]
*  Was it 97 when they allowed? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2121.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny because, yeah, you watch the commercial. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2122.36s)]
*  And then at the end, it's like side effects. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2124.6s)]
*  It's the best thing in the world to get to that last 20 seconds. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2126.72s)]
*  You're like, I know you're going to cook out. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2130.08s)]
*  Everything looks great. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2132.7999999999997s)]
*  Next thing you're an asshole is fucking spraying blood and you're suicidal. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2133.6s)]
*  Yeah. Like what? Yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2138.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, I mean, and they say it all so fast. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2140.36s)]
*  This is how you know. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2142.0s)]
*  Yeah. Big set of thoughts. Right. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2144.4s)]
*  Suicide ideation. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2145.92s)]
*  Rectal bleeding. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2148.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2150.2799999999997s)]
*  like, fortunately, at this point in my life, I haven't been on many medications, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2152.84s)]
*  but I went on a run with SSRIs and I can tell you for me, it's like it's [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2156.2s)]
*  the last 20 seconds applied more than the first two minutes of the commercial. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2160.52s)]
*  Like I didn't find any benefit in that. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2163.64s)]
*  And it's yeah, it's I don't know. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2165.84s)]
*  I think there's alternatives to [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2167.68s)]
*  to pharmacy medicine in a lot of cases, like maybe even if it's just habits, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2171.84s)]
*  you know, like it's OK to prescribe a medication to to keep somebody on course. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2175.84s)]
*  They're like, you know, for example, like I've got I've got a relative of mine. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2180.16s)]
*  I won't call him out, but he won't change the way he eats at all. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2183.72s)]
*  But he'll take whatever medications every day to keep his his, you know, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2186.92s)]
*  keep the diabetes away and keep his blood sugar, blood pressure low and all that. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2190.36s)]
*  But it's like there should be more integration of like, hey, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2194.28s)]
*  maybe this is like a plan of what you should do to go along with this medicine. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2197.2000000000003s)]
*  Ideally, eventually get it's like they don't want you to really get off the medicine, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2200.6000000000004s)]
*  though, if anything, they want you to keep taking it right. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2203.88s)]
*  So like, yeah, it's weird. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2205.76s)]
*  It is weird that it's almost advertised like it's a soda or a or a car or something. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2207.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, well, it's weird that, you know, people are so [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2211.8s)]
*  we're so kind of like dependent on other people to take care of us [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2215.1600000000003s)]
*  that we would rather go somewhere and get some medication [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2221.08s)]
*  than fix our life, then fix your lifestyle choices. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2225.52s)]
*  And that's and we've been programmed to sort of think that there's solutions for you out there. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2229.6000000000004s)]
*  Go get those solutions. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2234.48s)]
*  That's not a solution. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2236.08s)]
*  Like internally, you need to reconsider like what you're doing to your actual physical body. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2237.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, what are you doing to your physical body? Yeah. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2241.28s)]
*  Like, are you are you giving your physical body the exercise [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2243.2799999999997s)]
*  that it deserves to be robust and healthy? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  If you're not, you should. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2247.52s)]
*  Are you eating food that's nutritious? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2248.9199999999996s)]
*  If you're not, you should. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2250.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, well, and how do you do? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2252.12s)]
*  I mean, how do you do that today's time anyway? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2253.4399999999996s)]
*  If you don't have a lot of money like what you can exercise, nutritious food. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2255.4799999999996s)]
*  Oh, it's exercise. Certainly. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2258.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but there's there's a way to eat nutritious food on a budget, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2260.16s)]
*  but you have to be diligent. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2263.4799999999996s)]
*  And the problem is fast food and food deserts. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2265.2s)]
*  But if you have a supermarket, if there's a supermarket where you live, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2268.6s)]
*  then you can get food. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2271.36s)]
*  And if the supermarket has food, you can get healthy food. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2272.28s)]
*  And it's not that much more expensive. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2274.6400000000003s)]
*  Even people that go on a carnivore diet. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2276.0s)]
*  I know people that go on a carnivore diet on a budget and they buy out. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2277.6400000000003s)]
*  They go to Costco and get a big tube of ground beef [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2280.56s)]
*  and they freeze a lot of it and they cook a bunch of it like in portions. Yeah. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2284.84s)]
*  You know, I know. Yeah. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2288.8s)]
*  And that's a lot better than the crap from the store. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2290.04s)]
*  But even it's not like I mean, you read about. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2291.84s)]
*  I mean, just in the part of the country I'm at, we've got [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2295.32s)]
*  a really close family of ours that farms the father and the son [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2297.96s)]
*  have both died from cancer from what they've been, you know, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2302.0s)]
*  from the commercial agriculture they've been in spring and all like. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2304.4s)]
*  And all that stuff ends up in the food. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2307.0s)]
*  And you get I've read about microplastics in the food like, you know, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2308.52s)]
*  you go and you go and buy a tub of ground beef, like how much plastic [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2312.08s)]
*  was in the food that they have all the all the bags of crap [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2314.88s)]
*  that they threw in there to feed the feed the animals. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2317.96s)]
*  But it's just it is really, I think the only way to end this time [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2320.12s)]
*  in the area we're in, unless you're going to go by really expensive food, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2324.08s)]
*  out of like some fancy, smanche grocery store that I can't spell the name of. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2327.28s)]
*  It's like you're really better off going to somebody local and buying it direct, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2330.92s)]
*  like buying it almost straight from the farmer. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2334.76s)]
*  Well, certainly if you have an organic farm near you. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2336.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2339.88s)]
*  But yeah, pesticides and herbicides are a real deal. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2341.0400000000004s)]
*  Atrazine, you know, Alex Jones famously said to turn the frogs gay. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2343.48s)]
*  But they are. It's they're making them hermaphrodites. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2348.5600000000004s)]

*  of time. Like, you know, you go work your nine to five or whatever. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2462.88s)]
*  You come home and then you just start swiping, start wasting your rest [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2465.88s)]

*  I'm trying to shame them folks. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2480.6400000000003s)]
*  Maybe you should talk to your wife every now and again. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2482.08s)]

*  And I don't even mean so much video games, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2490.0s)]
*  but just like that mindless scrolling that I that like I've [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2491.56s)]
*  like I found myself being into to grow. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2494.72s)]
*  I've seen more people get hit by cars over the last like five months on Instagram. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2497.2799999999997s)]

*  More people get mauled by animals. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2502.84s)]
*  Instagram's wild. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2504.96s)]
*  It is wild. The shit they're allowed to show you. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2506.72s)]
*  Yeah. And like one of them was like, it's OK. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2509.16s)]
*  He's fine. Like like that was like in the like there was a big like letter, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2511.48s)]
*  you know, a big print over the video of this guy get hit by a truck. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2516.88s)]
*  Like that guy is not fine. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2520.1600000000003s)]
*  There's not a I'm not a medical expert. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  But when you get hit by a truck and launched into the windshield of an oncoming car, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2524.88s)]
*  I guarantee you, you're not fine. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2528.96s)]
*  No, I get it. Look, I've been that guy that sat. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2530.52s)]
*  I've wasted at least an hour sometimes in a row watching like Russian dashcam [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2532.8s)]
*  videos of like these logging trucks flying off the road and stuff like, I don't know. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2537.04s)]
*  It's there's something like that. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2540.32s)]
*  It just gets your brain excited. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2542.48s)]
*  You know, I don't know. It's not very addictive. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2544.1200000000003s)]
*  It's not good for you to see that many people die [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2546.32s)]
*  and that many people get bit by crocodiles. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2548.56s)]
*  I've seen more people get there by crocodiles. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2550.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck is wrong with my algorithm, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2552.24s)]
*  but I've seen more people get bit by crocodiles for the last six months. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2554.7599999999998s)]
*  They're having a long ass time. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2557.92s)]
*  But yeah, it's mostly a waste of time, but it's also fun. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2559.48s)]
*  There's a lot of funny videos on there. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2562.44s)]
*  It's just a matter of being disciplined. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2564.04s)]
*  You just got to know when you're scrolling too much. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2565.72s)]
*  And the way I avoid that is by doing stuff. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2567.7999999999997s)]
*  So there's a lot of stuff I do, you know, whether it's archery or playing pool. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2570.96s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff that I do around. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2574.4s)]
*  There's no time. You don't. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2575.72s)]
*  You're not spending any time on that. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2577.3199999999997s)]
*  And so there's a complete different focus. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2578.9199999999996s)]
*  Like when I'm shooting a bow, when I'm shooting at a target [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2581.24s)]
*  and I'm just practicing, my mind is empty. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2585.2799999999997s)]
*  All I'm thinking about is the shot process. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2587.8399999999997s)]
*  All I'm thinking about is whether or not the arrow broke clean. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2590.04s)]
*  Did I move my shoulder? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2593.9599999999996s)]
*  Why would why did that one go three inches left? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2595.6s)]
*  Like what happened there? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2597.64s)]
*  Was it that my elbows, my elbow up high? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2598.7599999999998s)]
*  How is my follow through? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2602.12s)]
*  OK, let's think about it and let's do it again. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2603.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's like a mind cleansing thing. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2605.36s)]
*  Yoga classes like that, if you can get to find a good, hot yoga class. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2608.1200000000003s)]
*  Man, when you're fucking standing there holding on to one foot [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2612.1600000000003s)]
*  and one foot is extended, you're hobbling around on one like, bitch, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2615.76s)]
*  you ain't thinking about jack shit. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2618.4s)]
*  But what is a good job of connecting you to your body, too, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2619.88s)]
*  which is something maybe we're not very good at either. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2623.0800000000004s)]
*  It's very good for people. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2625.6000000000004s)]
*  Yoga is like one of if I had one thing to recommend someone [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2626.6800000000003s)]
*  has never done any exercise before. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2630.6400000000003s)]
*  Please try yoga. Don't hurt yourself. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2632.04s)]
*  Go slow, because a lot of people do hurt themselves. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2634.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I can't imagine me trying to do that. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2636.1600000000003s)]
*  One of my friends is a doctor said that yoga is like one of the main people [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2638.1600000000003s)]
*  that it's yoga and jujitsu, he said. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2643.44s)]
*  People that come in to see him for treatment. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2645.0s)]
*  But jujitsu makes sense. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2647.6000000000004s)]
*  It's literally a sport of trying to break yoga. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2648.6400000000003s)]
*  You would think you would you think it'd be the opposite of anything. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2650.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I've pulled muscles in yoga. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2653.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you're you're doing hard stuff. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2654.84s)]
*  But hot yoga, I think is a little better for that, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2656.28s)]
*  because it really does warm your body up like almost instantly. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2658.2400000000002s)]
*  And then like if you do the Bikram series, I know that guy was a creep. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2660.84s)]
*  But if you do the series, it's not even he I don't believe [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2663.6s)]
*  he even invented that series of poses. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2666.68s)]
*  I think he just popularized it. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2668.92s)]
*  And they're all like standard yoga poses. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2671.2799999999997s)]
*  But that series is designed very well to get you really warmed up. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2672.72s)]
*  So by the time you get into more complicated and challenging movements, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2676.7999999999997s)]
*  your your body's pretty warmed up. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2680.8399999999997s)]
*  It's a good system. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2682.6s)]
*  They're really it's fucking hard, man. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2683.8399999999997s)]
*  A 90 minute hot yoga class at 105 degrees is a motherfucker. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2685.3199999999997s)]
*  That sounds great for that. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2689.16s)]
*  Sounds like a great walk away from that, that feeling you get. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2690.2s)]
*  Oh, you feel so relaxed. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2693.0s)]
*  That is one thing I'm looking forward to now is like, you know, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2694.88s)]
*  continuing to focus on mental health and that area. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2698.32s)]
*  But also, like I'm excited to get into better shape physically. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2701.04s)]
*  And just like the only thing I've done in the last six months at all is running. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2704.92s)]
*  We were planning on we were planning on trying to trying to schedule a run [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2710.2s)]
*  in September that I think was like 10 miles or something. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2714.64s)]
*  So as a friend of mine that I've been running with, you know, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2716.92s)]
*  two or three days a week and even that just [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2719.8s)]
*  whatever's on your mind when you start, it's gone by the time you leave. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2722.16s)]
*  You know, it's just it's something good about like getting everything connected again. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2725.24s)]
*  But music is big for me on that, too. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2728.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, that's just getting your playing an instrument singing like you're just [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2730.96s)]
*  everything's that everything's all all one again. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2735.96s)]
*  You know, it's very easy, especially and maybe because of social media [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2738.68s)]
*  and because of the way technology, I don't know what it is. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2741.56s)]
*  I'm certainly no Dr. Phil, but it's like the world we live in today. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2743.7999999999997s)]
*  Your mind is very easily disconnected from like your body physically. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2746.64s)]
*  Like it's you can get lost just worrying and thinking and doing. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2750.64s)]
*  And, you know, it's it's good to have something like that, I guess, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2754.56s)]
*  just have grounding is the word or whatever. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2757.2s)]
*  I don't know. But it's good to have something like that to like [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2759.24s)]
*  get you back in the reality again. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2761.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. My belief is that all human beings need something creative, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2763.3599999999997s)]
*  whether that's something creative as a game that you play, that you get to like [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2767.64s)]
*  invent moves or think about things and strategies or whether that game [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2770.68s)]
*  or whether that creativity expresses itself in music or in an illustrate [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2775.16s)]
*  drawing, painting something. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2779.16s)]
*  I think people really get a great satisfaction out of making things [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2781.2799999999997s)]
*  and of creating things. Sure. And everyone's good at something. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2786.16s)]
*  That's what's great. I'd say almost everyone's good at something. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2788.7999999999997s)]
*  I know some people. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2791.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, maybe they haven't figured out what it is. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2792.68s)]
*  But, you know, like you'd be that's one thing I've enjoyed over the years [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2794.7999999999997s)]
*  with like what I've done in the past is meeting all these different people, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2798.16s)]
*  even if it's like I you'd be surprised at how how unique people are [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2801.0s)]
*  and what they're able to do and what like, I don't know, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2805.6s)]
*  everyone seems like they have that one thing. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2808.28s)]
*  Maybe they maybe even if it's something that they had as a kid [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2810.0400000000004s)]
*  that they lost along the way. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2812.52s)]
*  But like people are people are really good at shit. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2813.6400000000003s)]
*  Sometimes you underestimate people and people don't spend the time [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2816.1200000000003s)]
*  they need to develop the craft that is they have. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2818.6800000000003s)]
*  But it's also sometimes people don't find a thing early on in their life [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2820.6000000000004s)]
*  where they get into it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2825.84s)]
*  You know, so if they don't have a thing ever, it's very difficult for them [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2827.32s)]
*  to gravitate towards a something. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2830.92s)]
*  But that's why taking class, that's like martial arts classes are great for that, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2833.36s)]
*  because all of a sudden you're learning this new thing and it's exciting. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2836.8799999999997s)]
*  Like, oh, my God, it's Monday night. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2839.72s)]
*  We're going to go to jujitsu class. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2840.8799999999997s)]
*  You got your little white belt on. You're tying it. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2842.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2844.2799999999997s)]
*  But afterwards, you feel like, wow, I really did something. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2846.0s)]
*  I really challenged my fears. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2848.04s)]
*  I really took like a class and I'm learning some stuff [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2849.52s)]
*  and I'm doing it with other people that are learning and I'm making new friends. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2852.56s)]
*  Like there's there's something really cool about that. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2855.64s)]
*  And that's also a thing that people need that they don't have is like a real community. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2857.64s)]
*  You know, like feeling of community, you know, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2862.52s)]
*  like one of the nice things about comedians is that we all work together. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2865.2400000000002s)]
*  So this is like this feeling. This is a real feeling of community. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2868.76s)]
*  We go on the road together. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2871.4s)]
*  We travel to different countries together. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2872.44s)]
*  Like all the guys that I go on the road with, we're friends. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2874.36s)]
*  Like we hang, we laugh. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2876.6800000000003s)]
*  We're just we're having drinks and having dinners, places and just everywhere you go. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2878.12s)]
*  You're with family. It's beautiful. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2882.64s)]
*  It's beautiful in that way. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2884.4s)]
*  And if you don't have that, man, if you don't have a thing that you really like, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2885.88s)]
*  we are really like connected to like minded people, it sucks. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2889.0s)]
*  It's not fun. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2892.8s)]
*  You know, it's like maybe the friends that you have are all fucked up [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2894.24s)]
*  and they're going in the wrong direction. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2897.48s)]
*  Try to pull you with them. Right. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2898.8799999999997s)]
*  Maybe your job. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2900.68s)]
*  That happens. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2901.3999999999996s)]
*  Like you have to be careful who you keep in your social circle [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2902.2s)]
*  because you'll end up just like them. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2904.6s)]
*  You know, well, you have to be careful of energy vampires. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2906.08s)]
*  There's people that are energy vampires and they'll steal from you. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2909.3999999999996s)]
*  They really will. They'll steal from you. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2912.8799999999997s)]
*  They'll steal. They don't want to do the work, but they want you to do the work for them. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2914.64s)]
*  Like they want you to be involved in everything that they're doing, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2918.3599999999997s)]
*  even though they're not making any changes. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2922.32s)]
*  And they want to drag you in and they want it to be the focus of all the attention. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2924.44s)]
*  And and you really find out after a while that if you were around positive people, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2928.32s)]
*  then all of a sudden you're uplifted and you have all this energy. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2934.04s)]
*  Yeah. And it's funny how that works. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2936.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's interesting. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2938.0800000000004s)]
*  All that stuff kind of goes on behind the scenes and you don't really think about it. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2938.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. One thing that really benefited me, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2941.52s)]
*  like even in my early 20s on, a lot of my friends seem to be older. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2945.1200000000003s)]
*  One of my best friends, he's in his he's probably I'm 31. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2948.3199999999997s)]
*  He's probably in his mid 40s. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2952.52s)]
*  And then everyone above them is like my best drinking buddy for years. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2955.4s)]
*  He's like 65, 66. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2959.56s)]
*  I love hanging out with older people, though, because they're just they're a lot wiser. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2961.92s)]
*  And they're they some of them. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2965.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, well, you have to I mean, you have to choose. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2966.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's some old. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2968.96s)]
*  Well, I'm a dummy, too. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2970.44s)]
*  So it's OK if I'm hanging out with dummies. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2971.44s)]
*  But yeah, I like hanging out with older people like they just and you hear you. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2973.08s)]
*  It reconnects you back to like, I don't know. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2977.2000000000003s)]
*  They just experience so much more than you ever could in that extra 20 years [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2980.32s)]
*  or whatever, 10 years. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2983.76s)]
*  It's like those are the kind of people you want to surround yourself with [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2984.84s)]
*  or people that are going to that are that are more experienced than you, more wise, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2987.28s)]
*  people that you can aim toward being. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2992.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Certainly not people that that are immature or on a bad streak. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2994.44s)]
*  Or even like now, like I'm trying I'm cutting out the drinking. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=2998.0800000000004s)]
*  Like I said, I haven't gotten high [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3001.1200000000003s)]
*  and almost I guess almost two months now, a month and a half or two months. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3003.0800000000004s)]
*  That was your problem, was the weed? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3006.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3008.08s)]
*  Well, the problem for me was [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3009.7599999999998s)]
*  I knew that I needed to do this, like I knew I needed to. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3014.7999999999997s)]
*  I procrastinated with music a long time. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3019.16s)]
*  I mean, I'm 31. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3021.3599999999997s)]
*  I've been playing guitar and singing on and off since I was a kid. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3022.48s)]
*  Like my grandma was in a band years ago. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3025.68s)]
*  And so like little I remember as a little kid, what got me interested in all of it [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3028.2s)]
*  was going, you know, Dukes of Hazzard when I was a kid, I was like five. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3031.24s)]
*  I used to sit with my grandma and we'd sit and watch Dukes of Hazzard [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3035.2s)]
*  and watch Waylon Jennings pick that guitar. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3037.8s)]
*  Of course, I had no idea who Waylon Jennings was, but that just like [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3039.7599999999998s)]
*  I just fell in love with that. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3042.72s)]
*  And so grew up listening to like that 70s country. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3044.16s)]
*  And she loved all the old stuff, like the 50s and 60s. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3047.44s)]
*  And even in the 70s, even, you know, Janice and all that. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3049.96s)]
*  And so like she really introduced me a lot into music when I was a little kid. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3053.2s)]
*  And so like I just kind of held on to it, but never, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3056.0s)]
*  never pursued it the way I should. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3058.52s)]
*  And then I'd play at a bonfire party or I'd play at whatever. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3060.12s)]
*  It's a friend's house and everybody's like, man, you got to do something with this. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3063.64s)]
*  You're, you know, you don't want to waste this talent you've got and whatever. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3066.6s)]
*  And that would almost make me feel even shittier because I'm like, oh, man, I suck. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3070.0s)]
*  Like I'm such a piece of crap for not doing something with this. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3073.6s)]
*  And so, yeah, like when I was outside of work, it's like I would just I would just [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3075.92s)]
*  I drink, I get just absolutely stoned. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3080.3599999999997s)]
*  And I would just sit around and try to think about anything. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3083.16s)]
*  But what it was that I really needed to be doing, which was like. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3085.7999999999997s)]
*  And so it is kind of like funny, but that's ended up with kind of sparked me [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3088.8399999999997s)]
*  into like writing all these songs and doing all this stuff, because it's like, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3091.88s)]
*  I don't know, just like with you, probably with some what you do, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3095.6800000000003s)]
*  jujitsu or whatever, it's like for me, songwriting is it gets my head, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3098.32s)]
*  like you said, getting your head clear, you know, because that's all you can. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3102.6400000000003s)]
*  And songwriting is interesting for different people. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3105.7200000000003s)]
*  But now that I've been in it, I guess I've been in the industry for two weeks [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3108.28s)]
*  and I've talked to like, now that you've been in the industry and conquered it. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3112.0s)]
*  Now that I'm an industry expert, it's like some of the other musicians [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3115.6800000000003s)]
*  I've talked to, like the people I've looked up to over the years. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3118.52s)]
*  They experience this, too. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3120.7599999999998s)]
*  But certain people, when you songwrite, it's a very [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3121.8799999999997s)]
*  it's a it's dramatic. Like, do you write all your own songs? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3125.64s)]
*  Yeah. But it's it's have you been accused of not writing your own songs [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3129.3199999999997s)]
*  very early on? Yeah. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3133.2799999999997s)]
*  Because since my state, I guess it's not even my stage name. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3134.52s)]
*  It's Oliver Anthony Music. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3137.64s)]
*  And so it's supposed to represent music from, you know, Oliver Anthony Music [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3139.24s)]
*  as my my grandfather. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3143.24s)]
*  And so he grew up in the 30s in the mountains and used to tell all these [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3144.56s)]
*  wild stories about how life was back then. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3147.3199999999997s)]
*  But the music's just sort of a characterization of like [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3149.12s)]
*  that period in time and those people, you know, and that's so yeah. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3151.96s)]
*  So your real name is not all. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3156.64s)]
*  Yeah. Christopher, Christopher Anthony Lunsford is my real legal name. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3158.12s)]
*  And so that's what's on like, like, if you look up the songwriting, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3161.16s)]
*  decide to sing as Oliver Anthony, just in. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3163.88s)]
*  Well, like I said, I have it. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3167.08s)]
*  I just had the the YouTube channel listed as Oliver Anthony Music, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3168.16s)]
*  just because like that's sort of that's sort of the the demeanor or the [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3173.0s)]
*  like I said, the character I was like that older Virginia style music. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3177.52s)]
*  Like if you if you look, if you go on YouTube and you look up [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3181.8s)]
*  that type of music from back then, like those old recordings of people, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3184.88s)]
*  like that's that's what I just love that type of stuff. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3187.84s)]
*  Do you think you're going to keep that name? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3191.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I mean, a lot of people still call me Chris. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3193.04s)]
*  And I've posted on social media, call me what I mean. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3195.56s)]
*  I've been called a lot worse than either of those things. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3197.56s)]
*  But yeah, it'll it'll stay Oliver Anthony Music indefinitely. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3199.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's a it's a it's a special name. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3202.84s)]
*  It's a special name to me, not only because it was my grandfather's name, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3205.24s)]
*  but it's it's sort of like to me, it reminds me of how much [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3207.56s)]
*  how different things were back then. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3211.08s)]
*  But he was born Oliver Anthony, but everybody called him Anthony growing up. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3212.3599999999997s)]
*  And so like he always thought his name was Anthony Oliver and last name Engel. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3217.4399999999996s)]
*  And so like it wasn't until he was in his 60s and going to retire, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3223.3999999999996s)]
*  he realized that his name didn't match his birth certificate. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3227.7599999999998s)]
*  So he had to actually change his legal name when he was in the 60s. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3230.68s)]
*  But it's because he thought his name was Anthony Oliver. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3233.04s)]
*  Yeah. And so his whole life, but his legal name was. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3235.2s)]
*  And so yeah, his parents named him. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3237.52s)]
*  So it's just like, but but all the paperwork back then was so scattered up [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3239.96s)]
*  because a lot of people were illiterate. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3243.48s)]
*  And of course, documents weren't tracked as well as they are now. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3246.04s)]
*  You know, so it's like, yeah, there's people in the family [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3249.28s)]
*  that have a different spelling and it's the same last name, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3252.0s)]
*  but a few letters are different and stuff. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3254.48s)]
*  It's just kind of cool. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3255.96s)]
*  Like, but he just he just thought that was crazy. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3256.8s)]
*  He had to change his name when he was 65. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3259.24s)]
*  He could draw his retirement now because it's social security [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3260.88s)]
*  and everything was under a totally different name. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3262.96s)]
*  But that's crazy. It's just special to me. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3264.6800000000003s)]
*  He was he's like the only other one in the family like me. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3267.8s)]
*  Most of our families like average height, six feet and under. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3270.5600000000004s)]
*  But he and I were both, you know, six, six, redheaded, left handed. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3273.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, I just I don't know, in a lot of ways, I just [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3277.1200000000003s)]
*  I thought it was special to kind of respect him. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3279.88s)]
*  He passed away in 2019. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3281.84s)]
*  And that's kind of when I I guess that's when I first kind of adapted [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3283.4s)]
*  the name for the music. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3286.6400000000003s)]
*  I didn't really get serious with anything until probably two weeks ago. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3287.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, until a couple of weeks ago, probably until I think I uploaded [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3291.04s)]
*  the first original, like like when I was when I decided I was in it to win it [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3294.4s)]
*  and I really wanted to make this thing happen. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3298.52s)]
*  It was probably about it. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3301.48s)]
*  Yeah, probably May of last year when I uploaded Ain't Got a Dollar. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3302.1600000000003s)]
*  Or it might have been Rich Man's Gold was the first one I uploaded on YouTube. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3305.2400000000002s)]
*  But that's when I decided like, all right, I'm I'm doing this thing. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3308.0800000000004s)]
*  But yeah, so you were just smoking too much weed, drinking too much [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3311.32s)]
*  and just procrastinating. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3315.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3316.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And so that and, you know, like [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3317.7200000000003s)]
*  anxiety is is definitely something that's underestimated. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3319.4s)]
*  You know, I used to laugh about not laugh about, but I used to just not really [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3322.7200000000003s)]
*  understand when people talked about mental health and anxiety, because [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3326.4s)]
*  everyone gets stressed out over stuff. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3328.92s)]
*  And so you think of anxiety as being just like this normal phenomenon [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3330.6s)]
*  everyone deals with. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3333.64s)]
*  But your your mind can really put you in a dark place to where that thing [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3334.64s)]
*  is just like it just holds on to you like, you know, and it just makes [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3338.36s)]
*  it very difficult for you to do anything. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3343.36s)]
*  And so, yeah, I spent at least two years of my life almost constantly [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3344.8s)]
*  just having what felt like just a not right here, just just wrenching at me. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3349.52s)]
*  Well, that's especially true for people that are pursuing a non-traditional life, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3352.88s)]
*  you know, with that doesn't have any guarantees. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3357.52s)]
*  It's it's a wild life to try to be an entertainer, like to just to choose [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3360.16s)]
*  to try to make it in this wild world of people that are singing [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3365.64s)]
*  and making songs and you want people to pay attention to you. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3371.16s)]
*  Like, you know, many fucking people are singing. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3374.6s)]
*  How many people can sing? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3376.92s)]
*  How many people are recording things? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3378.64s)]
*  And now with YouTube and the like, how many people are putting stuff up [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3380.3199999999997s)]
*  on the Internet for other people to enjoy? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3383.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a lot. Well, I know that you're going to stand out [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3385.2799999999997s)]
*  so that you're filled with anxiety just because of that, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3388.12s)]
*  because your this future is uncertain. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3390.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think for me, a lot of a lot of the anxiety came from me just. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3391.96s)]
*  Feeling like I was running out of time, like I knew that [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3396.2s)]
*  I knew that I had an ability to pursue this and kind of take this adventure on. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3400.04s)]
*  And I just had kept, like I said, for 10 years or more, I just [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3404.56s)]
*  I'd pick the thing up for a few months and then I'd put it down. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3407.36s)]
*  And just always doubting myself, you know? Yeah. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3409.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I think it's [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3412.4s)]
*  I mean, the universe in some weird way. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3415.44s)]
*  Always sort of finds. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3419.8s)]
*  Like for people that becomes very successful, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3424.6800000000003s)]
*  especially like yourself, it's almost like that's the best way to do it. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3427.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, I've never met anybody where I was like, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3431.88s)]

*  Like everybody that I meet that becomes successful, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3436.88s)]
*  especially like overnight people, it's like, oh, I see all these. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3439.48s)]
*  Well, that's why you're good. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3443.88s)]
*  That's why you're good. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3445.4s)]
*  You're good because you had a real life, like a real tortured, regular life, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3446.2000000000003s)]
*  like regular people. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3450.04s)]
*  If you're in the fucking Mickey Mouse Club when you're 14 [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3451.56s)]
*  and then all your famous people. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3455.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, I love Miley Cyrus to death and she's fucking insanely talented. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3457.6s)]
*  And I heard her new album is her best ever. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3461.76s)]
*  Everybody's raving about it. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3463.76s)]
*  But I feel bad for people that become famous when they're young. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3465.36s)]
*  I just feel like that's a heavy burden for you to have to carry. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3470.48s)]
*  And you didn't ask for it. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3473.7200000000003s)]
*  You can't ask for it. You don't know what it is. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3475.28s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's like getting a face tattoo when you're five. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3477.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, yeah, it's like I get a heart tattooed in my forehead. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3481.04s)]
*  Let everybody know I'm full of love. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3483.56s)]
*  Like, OK, Billy, let's take you to the tattoo parlor. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3485.08s)]
*  Like, I want to be famous so everybody knows me. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3488.52s)]
*  OK, Billy, let's get you in front of TV. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3490.88s)]
*  Yeah, and it's tough because, yeah, because then [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3493.2s)]
*  everyone's perception of everything's different anyway, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3496.44s)]
*  based off the way they were brought up, like, you know, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3498.64s)]
*  the way you and I look at something, we we both look at something a certain way. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3501.2s)]
*  And it's it's our way of looking at it. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3505.32s)]
*  And to us, that's reality. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3507.04s)]
*  But everyone's perception is just different, just inherently just [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3508.2400000000002s)]
*  based off the way we were raised and maybe even our genetics and the way our [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3511.2s)]
*  things we've experienced or the way the way our parents taught us things. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3514.8s)]
*  And so, like, yeah, it's it's [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3517.76s)]
*  it is tough if you get thrown into that at such an early age, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3520.5600000000004s)]
*  because this is just such a I feel bad for anybody that gets thrown into all this [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3523.0s)]
*  anyway, like the things I've seen and heard and witnessed and. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3526.6800000000003s)]
*  Just in a couple of weeks. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3529.6000000000004s)]
*  You need to do this and you got to do that. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3530.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's like this just people's kind of crazy sense of this almost crazy [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3532.28s)]
*  sense of urgency. Everyone's sort of thrown on me to do something with this. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3535.8s)]
*  And it's like I don't. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3538.96s)]
*  Yeah, at the end of the day, I've got to I've got to remember who I was, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3541.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, a month ago, and I've got to make sure that I, you know, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3545.52s)]
*  and it's OK to evolve from that and change. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3548.32s)]
*  And like, I don't I don't want to always be stuck being that guy, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3550.36s)]
*  but I don't want to like leave him behind either. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3552.96s)]
*  You know, I don't want to man. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3555.04s)]
*  Just be yourself. You're going to be fine. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3557.04s)]
*  This is like this conversation that we had over the phone. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3559.6800000000003s)]
*  I said, fuck all those urgent people. You have talent. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3561.6800000000003s)]

*  You literally have the number one song like instantly. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3573.4s)]
*  Well, you can't do that again. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3577.2s)]
*  How the fuck do you know? You don't know jack shit. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3578.48s)]
*  These people are crazy. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3581.24s)]
*  They don't understand what's going on and they don't understand [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3582.3999999999996s)]
*  what it's like to be famous. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3584.7999999999997s)]
*  You are in a weird spot. Yeah, I think what's so weird about you [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3586.0s)]
*  need to do right now is just keep being you and don't let anybody control you [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3589.3199999999997s)]
*  and don't let anybody rap and certainly don't let anybody put you on some crazy [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3594.64s)]
*  publicity campaign to try to capitalize on this great moment [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3598.52s)]
*  and immediately get some large record machine behind you and mass. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3602.88s)]
*  Yeah, because that really goes against the whole message that I wanted to get out [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3607.32s)]
*  in the first place. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3610.16s)]
*  And so, yeah, what would it benefit me to sign a big deal or have some like [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3610.96s)]
*  I don't know as busy as things get. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3614.56s)]
*  I don't know that I'd ever let anybody even manage my social media and stuff like [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3616.64s)]
*  that's just something that I'd like to have the hand on. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3620.64s)]
*  And then if I do mine, I do all my. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3624.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want anybody to do my shit. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3626.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think like just with you, like we talked about earlier, your show in general, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3628.52s)]
*  the reason people watch it isn't you know, you could you could add more people [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3631.56s)]
*  in and have more have more special effects and lights and what it you know, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3635.16s)]
*  figuratively speaking, like you could make you could make this into something bigger [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3640.04s)]
*  than what it already is, but it would just it would just take away. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3643.2s)]
*  Like sometimes the more you add, the more you take away. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3645.56s)]
*  It's the it's the fact that you have conversations with people that you're [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3647.48s)]
*  genuinely interested in. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3650.2s)]
*  Like we don't have enough real conversation any any way in the world. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3651.44s)]
*  Like we have very little. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3655.04s)]
*  I had never had a Twitter account. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3656.48s)]
*  And so I made one a couple of weeks ago to like start uploading. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3658.08s)]
*  Oh, you got to get on X and upload all the stuff. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3661.4399999999996s)]
*  And within like a week, I'm like, OK, I get I get it. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3663.7999999999997s)]

*  Yeah, I don't read any of my stuff on Twitter. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3669.3199999999997s)]
*  I do post occasionally. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3671.16s)]
*  You know, what I do like to do is repost things that I think are interesting. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3672.8799999999997s)]

*  OK, yeah. Yeah. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3683.7999999999997s)]
*  But yeah, a lot of people liked it. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3684.7599999999998s)]
*  I think on my account alone, it had more than [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3687.3599999999997s)]
*  let me say I'll tell you how many views it had. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3690.7999999999997s)]
*  I want to say it's somewhere around 11 million views. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3693.6s)]
*  I was explaining it to someone the other day. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3696.48s)]
*  I was like, do you know how insane that is? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3698.0s)]
*  Yeah, like that you could put something up that this guy just made. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3700.3999999999996s)]

*  That's a lot of human. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3711.04s)]
*  Yeah. So I've had to ask myself like why that happened the way it did. And [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3712.08s)]
*  and look, I'm not I've said this 100 times already, but like I'm no [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3716.88s)]
*  I'm certainly no preach like people have made comments about like, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3721.84s)]
*  oh, well, why does he he read scripture or whatever and talks about God? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3725.36s)]
*  But then he does other things like like I do have some foul language [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3729.0s)]
*  and I do sing some songs that I've written about whatever, you know, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3732.8s)]
*  getting high and hanging out in the woods. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3736.08s)]
*  But like it's just what I am. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3737.6400000000003s)]
*  Like I'm not here to say that I'm anybody better than anybody else by any means. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3739.7200000000003s)]
*  Didn't God invent the woods and what? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3743.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, there you go. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3746.24s)]
*  I don't believe anybody that does. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3747.3999999999996s)]
*  I God doesn't want you to have weed. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3748.6s)]

*  I like to capitalize on with my opportunity, it's just like [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3752.24s)]
*  because for me, just being in the position that I've been in the last two years [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3756.08s)]
*  and just the trash I've had in my head is [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3759.68s)]

*  I haven't been in a church in 10 years and I'm not saying I ever go back into one again. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3766.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't know about all that, but [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3770.3999999999996s)]
*  there's a lot of things in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3773.3599999999997s)]
*  that make sense and are timeless to today. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3775.9199999999996s)]
*  Like if people just could find [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3778.9599999999996s)]

*  Like I can remember just being around really close friends having dinner one night. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3904.08s)]
*  You know, like, you know, you get warm and fuzzy feelings [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3909.04s)]
*  being around people you care about. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3912.0s)]
*  And everything was just ice cold. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3913.9599999999996s)]
*  Like I just tried. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3915.48s)]
*  It was almost like I just tried to feel something other than what I was feeling. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3916.6s)]
*  What were you thinking during these times? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3919.96s)]
*  I was thinking that. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3922.52s)]
*  Like, what was the state of your life? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3924.6s)]
*  I was thinking like that I was going to I was thinking like [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3926.4s)]
*  see, I don't know. Suicide's a weird thing because and I can't speak for everybody. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3929.92s)]
*  But for me, like it wasn't it wasn't that I ever wanted to kill myself. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3933.48s)]
*  Like I knew I wanted to keep trying to fight and get out of whatever it is [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3938.28s)]
*  I was in, but it was almost like at some point I thought I was going to do it [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3941.92s)]
*  almost as a fight or flight response response, like [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3945.24s)]
*  that I couldn't escape whatever it is that I was in. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3948.64s)]
*  And like that was my own that was going to eventually be my only way out. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3951.2799999999997s)]
*  And so it's sad and it's whatever. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3954.04s)]
*  Like, I hate even talking about this, but I feel like I should talk about it. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3957.12s)]
*  I mean, where else to talk about it? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3960.4799999999996s)]
*  But on Joe Rogan. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3961.7599999999998s)]
*  But it's like that was one of the things that compelled me [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3962.52s)]
*  to throw a lot of these videos up just off my phone. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3964.6s)]
*  You know, like it's funny when I had when I had the song and maybe I still do. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3967.68s)]
*  I haven't looked at the charts in a week or whatever. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3971.9199999999996s)]
*  But I had stuff on iTunes that was like in the top two or three spots. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3974.32s)]
*  Other songs, those were just recorded off my Android phone, uploaded on YouTube. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3977.32s)]
*  I ripped the wave file off the YouTube video and then just uploaded through Distro Kid. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3982.2000000000003s)]
*  And so like people were buying like the number two song on iTunes at one point. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3986.76s)]
*  I think it was ain't got a dollar. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3990.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's what that's just the audio from the YouTube video. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3991.36s)]
*  And but I wanted to get all those. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3994.28s)]
*  I had a lot of these songs from the phone, from my Android camera, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=3996.2400000000002s)]
*  from my front camera on my Android phone. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4000.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And so like, it sounds pretty good. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4002.0s)]
*  I wanted to get all that up, though, because I didn't I really didn't know. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4004.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, I didn't know if I was going to be around to do it. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4009.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, pause that for a second. Let's listen to that. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4012.04s)]
*  I want to hear that. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4015.0800000000004s)]
*  If you don't get freaked out and uncomfortable listening to your own voice. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4015.6800000000003s)]
*  That's OK. No. OK. No, I like it because I want to hear what that sounds like. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4018.2400000000002s)]
*  This would be the yeah, the the ink. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4022.2400000000002s)]
*  They ain't got a dollar. The original version is a good example. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4023.92s)]
*  Recording off Android phones might be the new thing. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4034.32s)]
*  You can tell it's very mono. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4038.84s)]
*  The new authentic recording off Android phones. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4040.04s)]
*  When the sun goes down on this city, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4064.48s)]
*  pretty town, we can light up the bowl and pass it around. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4067.8s)]
*  I ain't got a dollar, but I don't need a dime. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4073.44s)]
*  Listen, man, you don't got to listen to nobody. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4082.76s)]
*  Tell them all to eat shit. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4085.6800000000003s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. You could do whatever you want, man. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4087.44s)]
*  You just keep doing that. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4090.52s)]
*  You just keep doing that and do concerts. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4091.6400000000003s)]
*  That's what got me uploading the songs. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4093.68s)]
*  Originally, I was like, I'll just go ahead and get something out there. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4095.24s)]
*  And then I mean, man, I was taking aspirin every day [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4098.5199999999995s)]
*  thinking like I was going to have a heart attack. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4101.44s)]
*  It was just I was having like all this crap. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4103.24s)]
*  So what was when you were recording these things and releasing them? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4105.28s)]
*  What was the hope? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4108.5599999999995s)]
*  The hope was that people would enjoy them. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4109.5599999999995s)]
*  The hope. Yeah, I was just trying to leave. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4111.5199999999995s)]
*  I was just trying to leave them out for the world in case like case you died. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4113.08s)]
*  Yeah. In case I I guess in case either I died from a heart attack or not. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4117.12s)]
*  Huge these songs would be if you died. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4120.639999999999s)]
*  I think that's like the most horrible rumor about Jimi Hendrix [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4124.240000000001s)]
*  is that his manager was like a gangster, had him killed. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4128.72s)]
*  His manager had him killed because he made more of a legacy. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4132.280000000001s)]
*  He was going to leave and he owned the music while Jimmy was alive. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4135.72s)]
*  And if Jimmy died, he would get the music. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4138.96s)]
*  And yeah, and they killed him. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4140.56s)]
*  Yeah, maybe maybe I thought like I figured like that was the only thing [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4142.92s)]
*  I had that was worth anything. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4146.4800000000005s)]
*  And so like if I was going to be a shitty enough person to like leave, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4148.08s)]
*  you know, leave a kid behind and like whatever my family and whatever else, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4152.8s)]
*  it's like at least there to be something there for them to be able to capitalize on. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4158.04s)]
*  And they were you was your bad feelings come from. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4161.160000000001s)]
*  Did they come from a lack of hope for your future? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4164.68s)]
*  Did you have like a sense of what would what would make you happy? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4167.76s)]
*  What you were missing? No, no. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4172.0s)]
*  Like it's was just the mind is the mind is well. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4173.4800000000005s)]
*  And for like, I guess I'm a creative person, I guess you'd say. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4177.080000000001s)]
*  And so like for creative people in general, life is very imaginative anyway. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4180.04s)]
*  So like, again, it's like you and I could go to the same restaurant, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4185.92s)]
*  sit down, order the same meal, have the same waitress, identical everything. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4189.76s)]
*  Right. In a parallel time. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4193.48s)]
*  And you and I would walk out of that restaurant noticing different things, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4195.64s)]
*  experiencing it completely different, like the mind perceives things individually. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4200.04s)]
*  Right. And so like when you get into a bad headspace like that, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4204.04s)]
*  your perception of what would otherwise be good things can become very bad. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4207.92s)]
*  And I don't know. I don't know the best way to explain it, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4212.28s)]
*  because I'm not well versed on psychology or anything like that. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4215.12s)]
*  But that's the best way I can explain it is like [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4218.04s)]
*  you don't understand sometimes what people are going through, even from the outside in. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4221.12s)]
*  You know, you look at people who are not living life right. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4224.96s)]
*  And you're like, I just wish he'd just get his shit together. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4227.599999999999s)]
*  I don't understand why he's doing that. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4229.88s)]
*  And it's like because maybe in his head, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4231.28s)]
*  what he's looking at is totally different than what you're looking at. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4232.679999999999s)]
*  And the mind's very complicated, you know, and [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4235.28s)]
*  we my understanding is even now with all the studies we've done [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4238.96s)]
*  and the technology we have, like we understand the mind very little. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4242.56s)]
*  But there's so much that goes into it. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4245.56s)]
*  And like so much of our thoughts come from our gut biome and all. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4247.16s)]
*  Like there's just there's millions of living things within us [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4250.28s)]
*  that I think influence the way we think and what we do. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4253.56s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's a very complicated thing. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4256.24s)]
*  So, yeah, it's easy for people to get to get off track. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4259.4s)]
*  And, you know, it's hard to get back on the track when you get off. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4262.72s)]
*  Like it really took. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4267.4800000000005s)]
*  That's why I say like I was really just even though I it was on paper. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4269.04s)]
*  Things were great, right? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4274.04s)]
*  Like I was married. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4275.04s)]
*  Things were like I had I have a great marriage. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4276.4800000000005s)]
*  I had a good job. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4278.88s)]
*  Like I worked my ass off, but I made good money. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4279.88s)]
*  And what were you doing for work? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4282.4400000000005s)]
*  So the last six years, I've been in industrial sales. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4284.4800000000005s)]
*  So I worked outside sales for. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4287.68s)]
*  Because I was in the I was in the industry, like working factory work [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4291.0s)]
*  when I was younger, had a bad accident, couldn't go back to that job. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4293.84s)]
*  And then during that recovery period, I went to work. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4297.84s)]
*  I don't can I say I don't think say the place or not. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4300.28s)]
*  You don't have to say the place. OK. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4302.4800000000005s)]
*  What was the accident? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4303.6s)]
*  Uh, I fell and hit my head. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4304.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4306.92s)]
*  Had internal. I had like an internal fracture. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4308.6s)]
*  I remember riding in the ambulance on the way. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4311.24s)]
*  I'd had seizures and all and passed out at the. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4313.04s)]
*  I was it's weird because I can remember laying there. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4315.44s)]
*  Remember the ambulance and the EMT people coming in. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4317.68s)]
*  Everybody around me talking to me. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4320.8s)]
*  But like I could hear them. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4322.0s)]
*  But I was just kind of in a dream. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4323.24s)]
*  And I do remember waking up in the ambulance on the ride. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4325.2s)]
*  I had like I had I remember I had blood coming out of my ear [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4328.56s)]
*  and maybe out of my out of my mouth or my nose. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4331.52s)]
*  There's but I remember I had blood on my I went and reached [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4333.76s)]
*  and I had blood on my face. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4335.56s)]
*  I was clean shaven then. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4336.6s)]
*  But and I asked the guy in the back with me in the ambulance. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4338.12s)]
*  I'm like, man, I was like, is everything am I going to be all right or what? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4341.52s)]
*  And he's like, buddy, we're doing the best we can. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4344.68s)]
*  I'm like, oh, shit. Oh, shit. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4347.52s)]
*  And that messed me up pretty bad. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4350.08s)]
*  I was in the hospital. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4351.48s)]
*  I was in the hospital for two or three days. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4353.36s)]
*  But even like for the next year after that, my memory was trash. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4355.32s)]
*  I had really bad balance issues. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4358.92s)]
*  Like it was difficult for me. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4360.6s)]
*  It just kind of jacked everything up. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4361.64s)]
*  I had a lot of inflammation and stuff in my brain. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4364.04s)]
*  And but that kind of and I question whether or not that had a lot [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4366.44s)]
*  to do with my mental health issues. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4370.5599999999995s)]
*  Like I've talked I've met a lot of people just even at the I've done. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4371.92s)]
*  I've done four shows so far and they've all been like intimate settings. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4375.4s)]
*  And so like I've taken hours after each one to talk to everybody, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4378.84s)]
*  to give everybody a chance to talk. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4381.96s)]
*  And I've talked to another guy who had a bad head injury [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4383.6s)]
*  and has dealt with something really similar to me. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4387.08s)]
*  But I almost wonder if that didn't affect that. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4389.84s)]
*  That kind of knocked a few screws loose upstairs with like everything else. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4392.24s)]
*  It's went on. But I tell you, like the thing. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4395.76s)]
*  So you got depressed after that. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4398.16s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Before then, I was totally fine. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4400.56s)]
*  Yeah. 100 percent. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4403.04s)]
*  They're connected. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4404.4400000000005s)]
*  100 percent. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4406.56s)]
*  I mean, it might not be the only factor that led you down that road, but 100 percent. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4407.52s)]
*  That's a major symptom of fighters. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4411.52s)]
*  When fighters get knocked out, when football players get knocked out, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4413.84s)]
*  depression, major symptom, major symptom. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4416.280000000001s)]
*  That's one of the real dangers of head trauma. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4419.56s)]
*  There's a lot of people who have had severe head trauma [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4421.4800000000005s)]
*  that go to take their own lives afterwards. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4424.64s)]
*  Yeah. And looking back, I think that could be a big part of it, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4427.52s)]
*  because I look back into my 20s and a lot of it was very dark. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4430.120000000001s)]
*  And that's after that. For sure. Yeah. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4434.0s)]
*  I guarantee you they're connected. Yeah. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4436.12s)]
*  I guarantee you. And I guarantee you. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4437.5599999999995s)]
*  Like if you got your system, like if you had really good health care, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4439.76s)]
*  they could they could find some issues with your endocrine system. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4444.36s)]
*  A lot of times with people that have really bad head injuries, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4447.44s)]
*  their pituitary gland gets damaged and your body is not producing hormones [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4450.76s)]
*  correctly anymore. And you're just all fucked up. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4454.84s)]
*  Your cortisol levels are all fucked up. Yeah. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4456.88s)]
*  Because I would say that was the thing. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4458.92s)]
*  It was almost like my brain was stuck in like this fight or flight type of thing. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4460.04s)]
*  And maybe that's what the writing helped, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4463.92s)]
*  because the writing helped like it helped emphasize [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4465.4s)]
*  that more creative part of my brain to get me out of that headspace. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4468.5199999999995s)]
*  But I loved my job. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4471.759999999999s)]
*  I did because I was still in the fields. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4473.759999999999s)]
*  I was still on job sites and industrial plants and hospitals. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4475.799999999999s)]
*  And so like I've I guess the reason that I've the reason I feel like [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4479.599999999999s)]
*  other than just really divine influence, again, based off of just the experience [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4484.28s)]
*  I've had the last 60 days with my faith and stuff, which is just [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4488.96s)]
*  and I love to touch on that some too. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4492.24s)]
*  But I've had so many conversations with people the last six or seven years [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4493.76s)]
*  because it was my job to go almost kind of like how you talk to people [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4498.72s)]
*  in here every day. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4501.68s)]
*  I was going around and talking to Joe Schmoe and Billy on job sites all day [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4502.24s)]
*  and every every walk of life, not just blue collar like. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4505.52s)]
*  And so like those are some just very authentic conversations [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4510.6s)]
*  you have with people because you're just a guy and they're just a guy [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4513.6s)]
*  and you're just talking. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4515.88s)]
*  And so you can still have those the same. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4516.84s)]
*  You can still have the same. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4519.04s)]
*  The same message kept coming across, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4520.76s)]
*  which is really what I guess I resonated in this song. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4522.88s)]
*  But there's people are just so tired and. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4525.36s)]
*  So, yeah, I think I think being in that position [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4529.96s)]
*  sort of gave me this unfair advantage to to look into the world, maybe. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4532.64s)]
*  On the inside, and I don't think it's unfair at all. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4537.68s)]
*  I think it's probably I mean, if you wanted to believe in fate, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4541.72s)]
*  you know, I don't believe in fate, but I should. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4545.400000000001s)]
*  If anybody should, I should believe in fate. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4547.52s)]
*  I've had a pretty lucky life. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4550.04s)]
*  Yeah, you have. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4552.24s)]
*  I don't necessarily think it's real, though. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4553.16s)]
*  But I also think if you believe it's real, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4555.88s)]
*  I think there's a lot of things if you believe it's [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4559.5199999999995s)]
*  a lot of what's going on with human beings is the way the mind perceive things. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4562.4s)]
*  And it's kind of the software you're running. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4566.92s)]
*  That's why we seek out people who are inspirational. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4569.32s)]
*  Like if you watch a David Goggins video, you will go. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4572.04s)]

*  We were saying David Goggins quotes [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4584.4800000000005s)]
*  are you running about carrying the boats and all that? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4586.16s)]
*  Yeah, it was going to carry the boat. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4588.08s)]
*  David's the fucking man. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4589.8s)]
*  And there's another guy, Jocko Willink. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4591.320000000001s)]

*  There's a video that I 100 percent legitimately play in my mind when I'm tired. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4600.04s)]
*  I say good. I say to myself, like I was in the cold plunge the other day [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4605.360000000001s)]
*  and I was being a bitch at like two minutes and 30 seconds. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4609.599999999999s)]
*  And I was like, good, listen to this video. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4612.4s)]
*  Have you ever heard this? It's amazing. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4614.16s)]
*  I don't think I have direct support. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4615.16s)]
*  And it's one of my guys that work for me. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4617.24s)]
*  He would he would call me up or pull me aside with some major problems, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4618.759999999999s)]
*  some issue that was going on. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4622.759999999999s)]
*  And he'd say, but also we got this and that the other thing. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4625.12s)]
*  And I look at him and I'd say, good. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4627.44s)]
*  And finally, one day he was telling me about some issue [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4630.719999999999s)]
*  that he was having some problem. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4633.92s)]
*  And he said, I already know what you're going to say. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4635.2s)]
*  I said, well, what am I going to say? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4639.36s)]
*  He said, you're going to say good. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4640.48s)]
*  I said, that's what you always say when something is wrong and going bad. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4644.44s)]
*  You always just look at me and say good. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4648.839999999999s)]
*  And I said, well, yeah, when things are going bad, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4652.719999999999s)]
*  there's going to be some good that's going to come from it. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4658.08s)]
*  Didn't get the new high speed gear we wanted. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4662.2s)]
*  Good. Didn't get promoted. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4665.36s)]
*  Good. More time to get better. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4668.64s)]
*  Oh, mission got canceled. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4672.280000000001s)]
*  Good. We can focus on the other one. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4674.08s)]
*  Didn't get funded. Didn't get the job you wanted. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4675.84s)]
*  Got injured. Sprained my ankle. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4679.76s)]
*  Got tapped out. Good. Got beat. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4681.96s)]
*  Good. Learned. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4685.400000000001s)]
*  Unexpected problems. Good. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4689.400000000001s)]
*  We have the opportunity to figure out a solution. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4693.12s)]
*  That's it. When things are going bad. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4697.52s)]
*  Don't get all bummed out. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4701.92s)]
*  Don't get startled. Don't get frustrated. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4703.040000000001s)]
*  If you can say the word good. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4709.64s)]
*  Guess what? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4713.64s)]
*  It means you're still alive. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4715.56s)]
*  It means you're still breathing. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4717.8s)]
*  And if you're still breathing. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4719.96s)]
*  Well, now you've still got some fight left in you. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4723.0s)]
*  So get up. Dust off. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4728.0s)]
*  Reload. Recalibrate. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4731.88s)]
*  Reengage. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4736.04s)]
*  Go out on the attack. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4739.4s)]
*  That's what's up. Yeah, I love that. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4744.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's software you can run in your mind. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4746.6s)]
*  You could run that. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4751.4s)]
*  You just need to listen to it and then apply. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4752.96s)]
*  That's real. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4756.799999999999s)]
*  Now, if you don't know that software and if you know that there's a human [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4757.719999999999s)]
*  being like Jaco out there in the world, it's a real person [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4761.04s)]
*  that really does think like that. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4764.4s)]
*  But you don't think it's possible. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4766.2s)]
*  But it is. So you have to be seen it. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4767.719999999999s)]
*  So you see it. Now, you know, run that software. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4769.599999999999s)]
*  Run that software. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4773.0s)]
*  I don't know how much of people's depression. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4774.04s)]
*  I mean, I think depression has a mosaic of problems [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4777.08s)]
*  that's associated with it and a mosaic mosaic of causes, like a large pattern. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4781.360000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff going on that causes people to be depressed. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4787.08s)]
*  Some of it in your case may very well have been from a physical injury. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4790.04s)]
*  And I think I think that's a big I never considered that until now. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4793.88s)]
*  So I think it's I think it's 100 percent. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4797.400000000001s)]
*  100 percent, because it's it's totally in the literature. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4800.08s)]
*  You know, my my good friend Dr. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4803.2s)]
*  Mark Gordon, he does a lot of work with traumatic brain injury patients. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4805.2s)]
*  And he runs that he runs this Wounded Warriors. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4808.96s)]
*  It's it's called. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4813.76s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4816.639999999999s)]
*  What is this is the thing that he works with those guys, Warrior Angels. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4817.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's helping people with traumatic brain injuries. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4822.36s)]
*  And he's helped countless soldiers, fighters, football players, always. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4825.28s)]
*  And it's real similar with a lot of them. Yeah. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4830.08s)]
*  And that's no hope. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4832.28s)]
*  And exactly. And that's and I guess that's the that's the thing that [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4833.24s)]
*  I've learned from this, again, from 18 year old Chris, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4837.16s)]
*  that thought a lot of that was just made up and people giving excuses [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4841.679999999999s)]
*  like to what I understand now about is, again, it feels those that [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4846.04s)]
*  that place that your mind can take you. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4852.28s)]
*  It feels just as real as anything else. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4854.599999999999s)]
*  Like even if you tell yourself like you can tell yourself a hundred times that, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4857.28s)]
*  oh, yeah, well, you still got a job. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4861.56s)]
*  You still have everything's fine. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4864.160000000001s)]
*  It's like if I don't know, it's your perception of reality [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4865.76s)]
*  becomes very distorted when you're in that place. And it's [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4869.88s)]
*  again, for me, I think a lot of it came down. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4874.400000000001s)]
*  I just knew I wasn't fulfilling whatever purpose it was. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4876.040000000001s)]
*  I was here to fulfill, you know, probably didn't have any energy [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4878.360000000001s)]
*  because you had a head injury. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4882.76s)]
*  It's probably a major factor in it. Yeah. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4884.76s)]
*  Major factor. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4887.4800000000005s)]
*  It's another major factor in people with head injuries. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4888.400000000001s)]
*  They drink a lot because their dopamine is really low. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4890.24s)]
*  You know, like it fucks up everything, man. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4893.32s)]
*  And there's people that have traumatic brain injuries [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4896.16s)]
*  that are subcocussive trauma from playing soccer. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4899.36s)]
*  People play soccer and heading the ball doesn't even hurt. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4903.12s)]
*  But you throttle throttle your brain in the cage over and over and over again. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4905.92s)]
*  And eventually you have TBI. That's real. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4910.4s)]
*  You have real like CTE symptoms for soccer players. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4913.2s)]
*  And it's crazy, but the head is just not designed to get hit. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4918.84s)]
*  Yeah. And I've I've experienced it with so many fighters, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4922.44s)]
*  so many guys that I know that got knocked out. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4926.28s)]
*  And then after the knockout, they're like severely depressed, both because they lost. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4928.32s)]
*  It was like that's even if you lose by decision, you get depressed. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4932.32s)]
*  Yeah. It's a terrible feeling to lose in front of the whole world. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4934.92s)]
*  Well, sure. Yeah. I mean, just inherent loss in a lot of animals is a does that, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4937.32s)]
*  you know, and that's a whole nother conversation. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4941.88s)]
*  But one thing I did find from Jordan Peterson talking about the lobsters, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4943.92s)]
*  it makes me think about the fighters, but it's like you lose that dopamine and that drive. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4947.16s)]
*  All those chemicals are very tightly regulated to your to your performance [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4950.88s)]
*  and your place sort of within the world. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4954.96s)]
*  What do you say about the lobsters again? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4956.44s)]
*  So if you have two lobsters fight the defeated lobster, he loses his drive and dopamine. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4958.48s)]
*  He's like there's some ridiculous chance that he won't win another fight. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4963.04s)]
*  Like he basically just becomes a bum lobster once he loses. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4968.68s)]
*  But they can give they can give them the same medications that they give humans [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4972.28s)]
*  to combat that like whatever anti-depress or whatever. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4976.84s)]
*  So they're giving SSRIs to lobsters. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4979.32s)]
*  Then they're out there fighting. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4981.639999999999s)]
*  We know they give SSRIs to like I've got some close friends in veterinary medicine. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4982.639999999999s)]
*  They have cats and dogs that take SSRIs. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4987.44s)]
*  Oh, God. Freaked out cats and dogs. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4989.96s)]
*  I can tell you my experience with SSRIs were not pleasant. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4992.04s)]
*  Like all it did was just make me very numb. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4994.84s)]
*  Just just like the cat. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4998.36s)]
*  Like and I'm not I'm certainly like again, I'm not giving anybody advice on anything. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=4999.44s)]
*  But just in my personal experience, especially for a guy, when you're on SSRIs, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5004.08s)]
*  he does a lot of things bad to you. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5008.5199999999995s)]
*  For one, like if you're in a relationship, I like I hear this on both sides with men and women. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5009.84s)]
*  But like good luck, good luck like making love with your with your lover. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5015.44s)]
*  Like good luck having sex because that's out the window. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5020.12s)]
*  It messes with that. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5022.4s)]
*  It messes with your with your thought with your thought patterns and takes away. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5023.5199999999995s)]
*  Like it was very difficult for me to write music when I was on it. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5028.2s)]
*  And so that was a short lived life. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5030.72s)]
*  But the best thing that I found that helped me other than just [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5032.6s)]
*  than just jumping into this and making this music happen, like along the way was actually [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5037.8s)]
*  I found a lot of benefits out of CBD, like even smoking CBD flower. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5043.160000000001s)]
*  And so like that surprisingly, like I never really got benefits from the oil. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5048.6s)]
*  But I'd say if anybody is in a position like listening to this right now [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5053.4800000000005s)]
*  where you're having like daily panic attacks and you're just like [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5057.4s)]
*  you're you're just there, you know, like if you're listening and you'll know what I'm talking about, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5061.4s)]
*  but you're at that like breaking point like I was. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5065.5599999999995s)]
*  I found smoking CBD joints like not ingesting it where we go through my system, go through my liver and all, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5068.599999999999s)]
*  but smoking it just like you would smoke traditional cannabis flower. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5074.32s)]
*  Knocked a lot of it right out. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5078.12s)]
*  Interesting. Now, it's not going to fix it. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5079.599999999999s)]
*  There's an underlying issue that you got to figure out and address, but it'll at least give you some like [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5081.48s)]
*  it gave me some very good relief from that. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5085.48s)]
*  And that's amazing. That's really good to hear for people because it doesn't get you high either. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5087.679999999999s)]
*  Right. It doesn't get you high. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5091.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But it reduces inflammation. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5093.08s)]
*  Yeah. Have you tried adjusting your diet? [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5096.48s)]
*  Well, I'm good now. That's what's that's what's so funny. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5098.919999999999s)]
*  Like since this has all happened, haven't had like I'm telling you again, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5101.16s)]
*  because you're on top of the world. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5105.799999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, but even before like it. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5106.879999999999s)]
*  I have to be careful with what I say, because I don't like my shit stinks. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5111.679999999999s)]
*  Like I'm nobody special and I'm not here to preach to anybody, but I'm telling you, like [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5115.44s)]
*  given things to God for me, alleviated 99 percent of what like [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5119.679999999999s)]
*  I had a like I don't know how to describe it, but when you when you experience [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5126.919999999999s)]
*  and I mean, you've done things that I haven't like with DMT and all, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5132.879999999999s)]
*  and that stuff's very intriguing to me. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5135.5199999999995s)]
*  And so I'm open minded to all that as well. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5136.96s)]
*  Like I'm not. But yeah, like I had when this when I kind of had this breakdown moment [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5138.719999999999s)]
*  and decided that I was going to let whatever ego I had go and just at this point is like [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5144.76s)]
*  I knew I didn't have much left in for me anyway. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5149.4800000000005s)]
*  And I wanted I wanted to serve whatever purpose it was that I was here to serve. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5152.12s)]
*  It's like you get this just overwhelming feeling and you [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5155.68s)]
*  just crying like a baby, just this very like warm feeling throughout me. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5160.2s)]
*  And that that really hasn't gone away since. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5164.0s)]
*  Like I I'm not the guy that can play in front of 12000 people on guitar. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5168.240000000001s)]
*  I would be like, I mean, I had never played a paid gig when we when we played the show [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5173.52s)]
*  at the farm market where Jamie Johnson showed up. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5178.080000000001s)]
*  That was my first paid gig. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5180.200000000001s)]
*  Like I'm not a guy to go out and play live shows. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5182.120000000001s)]
*  But I can tell you, I was so like [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5184.320000000001s)]
*  I was just so at peace being up there. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5187.400000000001s)]
*  Like it just felt like that's where I was supposed to be. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5189.72s)]
*  And that and with all this, it has been like there's no way that Chris [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5191.8s)]
*  from six months ago could handle what's gone on the last two weeks. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5195.52s)]
*  But I feel just so empowered from all of it. And [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5198.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5201.2s)]
*  I'm telling you, like, again, I'm not I'm not anybody special. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5202.2s)]
*  And I'm certainly not here to preach to anybody, but just from coming from somebody [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5205.88s)]
*  who was just really just in a really just fucked up place. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5209.16s)]
*  Like and I use that word like with discretion. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5213.24s)]
*  But in this case, it describes like where I was like that guy found a lot of peace [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5216.52s)]
*  like from this book and from looking at things in a different way. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5221.72s)]
*  Yeah. Looking at things through the. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5225.72s)]
*  Well, yeah. And I think for me, it was like a very, very [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5227.6s)]
*  I had been in, you know, I'd been in church growing up and I had been [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5230.8s)]
*  I'd been exposed to all that. But [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5234.04s)]
*  I'd found a lot of a lot of theatrics and a lot of politics in church [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5237.76s)]
*  and in religion when I was younger. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5242.28s)]
*  And so it just immediately turned me off to. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5243.84s)]
*  So if you can take us to like, what was like the day you picked it up? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5245.68s)]
*  What what was the feeling that you had, like what caused you to act? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5250.64s)]
*  What what was it like when you did it? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5254.56s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I'd been reading it here and there off and on. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5257.320000000001s)]
*  And I had for like off and on for a long time, like because I again, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5260.5199999999995s)]
*  I was introduced to it as a kid, but it was really just like. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5264.719999999999s)]
*  I remember I'd went to the I went to the E.R. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5271.719999999999s)]
*  for everything that was going on. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5274.24s)]
*  I mean, I thought I was seriously going to die like I was having [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5276.04s)]
*  shooting pains up under my jaw, down in my wrist and my leg, like just [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5279.04s)]
*  cardiovascular 101 symptoms. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5285.36s)]
*  Of course, I'm 31. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5287.32s)]
*  I had been like I could run four miles without stopping. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5288.24s)]
*  No problem. It's like I knew my heart was strong, but I just freaking out. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5291.84s)]
*  Yeah. But I went and did that. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5295.92s)]
*  And I remember being in the truck after that, just like. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5297.32s)]
*  And I just yeah, I just had a breakdown moment. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5301.32s)]
*  I was just just crying and was just just. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5303.24s)]
*  I just felt hopeless, like like almost the way a child feels hopeless [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5309.28s)]
*  when they, you know, like you can't find your parent or something [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5312.84s)]
*  like a like a four year old that can't find his parents or something. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5315.28s)]
*  I was just like, just didn't have anything left in me. And. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5318.08s)]
*  I don't know, I just [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5323.6s)]
*  I just decided like right then and there, I was like, I know I can't do this anymore. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5325.64s)]
*  And but I know I know that I can. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5329.2s)]
*  I know there's things that I need to do. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5332.76s)]
*  And I just I was just just told God, I was like, just let me do it. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5334.32s)]
*  Like, and I'll give all this shit up. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5338.64s)]
*  I'll give up the weed and I'll quit getting drunk and I'll quit. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5340.0s)]
*  I'll quit being so angry about things and I'll just like [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5343.44s)]
*  I'll just call it good. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5347.72s)]
*  Whatever I've done up from from up until I was 30 or whatever, 31. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5348.68s)]
*  Like I will just call that good and I'll start over again and [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5353.64s)]
*  I'll make him the focus and not me. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5357.96s)]
*  And I just tried to try to let my let my ego and everything that I was [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5359.96s)]
*  just let that go and just focus on because because obviously like [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5366.28s)]
*  it's not just me, I've seen it with even other people I know. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5371.0s)]
*  And I see it with celebrities and everything. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5373.56s)]
*  But I don't know. I just feel like [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5375.68s)]
*  we're in such a weird place right now in the world that. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5378.04s)]
*  I feel like God's working through inadvertently through certain people to get [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5381.88s)]
*  to get his point across. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5386.400000000001s)]
*  So take me to what what you did. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5388.56s)]
*  You start reading the Bible. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5391.68s)]
*  Like, what did you do? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5393.16s)]
*  I just changed my perspective. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5395.12s)]
*  You change. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5399.360000000001s)]
*  I quit worrying about me and I started worrying about what [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5400.280000000001s)]
*  what it is that I'm supposed to do. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5403.04s)]
*  You know, like it talks in the Bible about [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5404.76s)]
*  about being a servant and, you know, giving up, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5407.72s)]
*  I guess, my desire and my will and whatever it is that I that I want to do. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5411.68s)]
*  Like I don't know the best way to describe it, but it's about [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5415.320000000001s)]
*  it's about trying to use what I have as a tool versus [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5422.0s)]
*  doing what I can in the moment to give what give myself [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5424.96s)]
*  whatever satisfaction that it is I'm trying to get, you know, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5428.0s)]
*  it's about letting trying to let go of your ego, I guess, in a way. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5431.280000000001s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5434.72s)]
*  And I mean, people people pursue that mentality without faith. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5436.96s)]
*  I mean, it's the idea of there being something bigger than you. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5441.88s)]
*  But I think inherently all human beings idolize something like [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5444.4400000000005s)]
*  it talks in the Bible about false idols. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5448.96s)]
*  We all have false idols, like whether it's our phone or it's a celebrity [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5451.4400000000005s)]
*  or it's something we do or it's our addiction to food or drugs or whatever. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5455.4800000000005s)]
*  But like, it's very difficult for a human to be the biggest thing on their hierarchy. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5459.92s)]
*  There's always something above us, right, because we're always in pursuit [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5464.6s)]
*  of something bigger than whatever it is in that moment. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5467.4400000000005s)]
*  And I think for me, it was just about taking everything else, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5470.4800000000005s)]
*  all the distractions and all the other things in my life away [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5473.96s)]
*  and just ensuring that at least and look, I'm we're all we're all we all sin [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5476.240000000001s)]
*  and we all do stupid things like we're all just people. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5482.200000000001s)]
*  Nobody's special or righteous. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5484.64s)]
*  People sometimes act like they're special and righteous, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5486.160000000001s)]
*  but we're all just the same thing like. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5488.160000000001s)]
*  But it's just about trying to make that make that my idol, make make [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5491.72s)]
*  make God and the concept of what it is that he wants done on this earth. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5496.16s)]
*  My idol versus anything else, you know, like we all serve. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5499.8s)]
*  We all serve some master, whether we realize it or not. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5503.24s)]
*  So why not let it be the master that is above all? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5505.96s)]
*  And so when you made this transformation in your mind, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5509.5199999999995s)]
*  did you then start reading scripture like regularly? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5512.96s)]
*  Like, what did you start doing? Yeah, well, it was different. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5516.04s)]
*  Well, what's what really I guess it's like now I don't read it. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5518.08s)]
*  I don't read it because I feel like I should read it to be a better person. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5521.88s)]
*  It's like now I try to read it for the guidance within it. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5525.0s)]
*  And I'm still in the infancy stages of a lot of this. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5528.2s)]
*  Like I've read a lot of Psalms, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes and Luke. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5530.48s)]
*  And there's other good books, but just trying to. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5534.76s)]
*  I don't know, like trying to restructure, I guess. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5539.28s)]
*  On a granular level, like, I guess, the neural pathways in my brain [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5542.76s)]
*  that have certain habits and certain ways of thought, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5545.76s)]
*  like I've tried to retrain that to, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5548.0s)]
*  you know, like there's there's things it says like [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5551.48s)]
*  and I'll be very brief with this, I promise. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5553.96s)]
*  But like one thing, ironically, it's Proverbs 420, which I thought you were like. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5555.84s)]
*  So if there's anything better. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5561.92s)]
*  Perfect. Read it. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5563.16s)]
*  Preach. My son, pay attention to what I say. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5565.32s)]
*  Turn your ear to my words. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5568.4s)]
*  Do not let them out of your sight. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5570.36s)]
*  Keep them within your heart, for they are life to those who find them [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5571.92s)]
*  and health the one's whole body above all else. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5575.64s)]
*  Guard your heart for everything you do flows from it. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5578.200000000001s)]
*  Keep your mouth free from perversity. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5581.64s)]
*  Keep corrupt talk far from your lips. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5583.92s)]
*  Let your eyes look straight ahead. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5586.400000000001s)]
*  Fix your gaze directly before you. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5588.4800000000005s)]
*  Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5590.88s)]
*  Do not turn to the right or the left. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5595.4400000000005s)]
*  Keep your foot from evil. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5597.4400000000005s)]
*  But that's pretty fucking profound. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5599.56s)]
*  But the whole book of Proverbs is like that. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5602.4800000000005s)]
*  Like it's not preachy. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5604.48s)]
*  It's not. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5605.679999999999s)]
*  It's not what you think. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5607.36s)]
*  Like it's it's like it's good guidance. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5608.44s)]
*  It's like good guidance that you would want a father to give to his son. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5611.08s)]
*  You know, what? Where do you think it comes from? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5614.08s)]
*  Like if you had to guess, where do you think the Bible comes from? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5616.679999999999s)]
*  Like it was an oral tradition for who knows how many years [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5622.759999999999s)]
*  before they ever wrote it down. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5626.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. What do you think these stories come from? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5628.28s)]
*  What? I believe that people come across in different points of time, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5634.879999999999s)]
*  and I think they are given messages that need to be delivered. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5639.879999999999s)]
*  And I'm not in any way trying to parallel me to anyone [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5643.44s)]
*  in any of these books by any means, but I do think that [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5646.0s)]
*  throughout history, like even beyond from what's been written in this Bible, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5650.2s)]
*  there's been important people that came along and said important [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5653.48s)]
*  or maybe not not even important people. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5656.24s)]
*  Sometimes it's the lowly of the low [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5658.28s)]
*  that come along and just say things that need to be said. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5660.599999999999s)]
*  And if I could. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5663.5199999999995s)]
*  To me, it's like there's no question that this is an intelligent planet [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5665.8s)]
*  we live on in an intelligent solar system. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5669.96s)]
*  Everything is just much more immense than any human on Earth would admit. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5672.68s)]
*  Like even people in science, so much of science is based on theory. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5677.08s)]
*  Like it's this very elegantly written way of thinking. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5680.96s)]
*  But ultimately, if you take it down to it's like on a granular level, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5684.6s)]
*  it's very it's all in many ways based on theory. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5688.28s)]
*  And so I think the Earth is far more intelligent than we realize [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5691.44s)]
*  in the systems that we live in. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5695.0s)]
*  Like, I just don't think somebody just pulled all that out of thin air. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5696.16s)]
*  I do think that and maybe maybe it's [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5698.639999999999s)]
*  I've been waiting for my time to bring up the aliens because I. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5701.839999999999s)]
*  But anyway, but no, but in all seriousness, it's like for me, I just I believe that. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5704.48s)]
*  Well, let me if you if you read through it, it's so much of it is so timeless [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5709.839999999999s)]
*  and so much of it. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5713.839999999999s)]
*  If you read about the rich and the poor and the wicked and the way [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5715.44s)]
*  just the inherent human behavior that existed at the time [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5718.92s)]
*  when these books were written back then, it's so parallel to what goes on today. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5721.719999999999s)]
*  Like to the point that you wouldn't if you just read it out of context [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5726.36s)]
*  and didn't know it was scripture, a lot of it sounds like something [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5729.599999999999s)]
*  somebody wrote two hours ago and posted on a on a vlog or whatever. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5732.24s)]
*  It's like it's to me, it's there is no other book like it. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5736.679999999999s)]
*  Have you paid any attention to Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5742.36s)]
*  and their theories about the restarting of humanity? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5746.88s)]
*  It's a really fascinating [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5750.64s)]
*  field of of inquiry and discussion, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5753.52s)]
*  because it's now starting over time to be backed up by more science, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5757.0s)]
*  because there was always this curiosity, like when did the human race [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5761.4800000000005s)]
*  first invent civilization? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5766.08s)]
*  And the current theory is that it was about 6000 years ago. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5768.76s)]
*  It's Mesopotamia, Sumer and these areas, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5771.88s)]
*  which is where we found the first written language, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5776.24s)]
*  like first mathematics, cuneiform language. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5778.96s)]
*  But what they believe is that's a restarting of civilization [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5782.400000000001s)]
*  and that very likely civilization existed at a very, very high level, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5786.04s)]
*  somewhere around eleven thousand eight hundred years ago. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5790.8s)]
*  And that what caused the end of the ice age also caused [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5793.360000000001s)]
*  just a mass destruction [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5798.96s)]
*  all throughout the universe or all throughout the earth, rather, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5803.04s)]
*  of particles from space slamming into the earth. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5805.84s)]
*  That the earth goes through these comet storms periodically. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5809.400000000001s)]
*  And it happens, I think it's every June and every November. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5813.96s)]
*  And when they go through these clouds of comets, occasionally we get hit [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5816.76s)]
*  by big ones. And there's a lot of evidence for this. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5821.88s)]
*  And what they believe is that when you're looking at [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5824.96s)]
*  like the ancient Egyptian structures, when you're looking at some structures [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5829.08s)]
*  in Turkey and other parts of the Middle East, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5832.4800000000005s)]
*  you're looking at things that are older than twelve thousand years old. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5835.16s)]
*  Yeah. And I agree with that. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5838.36s)]
*  I think that it's obvious that technology existed, that we don't know anything [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5840.0s)]
*  about today. Just the construction of the pyramids alone. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5844.56s)]
*  We leaned you to that. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5847.32s)]
*  Like somehow or another, they were able to do that. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5848.88s)]
*  And they were able to do that with immense sophistication and insane [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5851.64s)]
*  capabilities, the ability to move stone from hundreds of miles that weighs tons. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5856.04s)]
*  Massive stones cut perfectly stacked on top of each other. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5861.16s)]
*  Two million three hundred thousand of them that are perfectly due north, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5864.96s)]
*  southeast and west. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5869.52s)]
*  That's the craziest thing is that they they can understand that. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5871.200000000001s)]
*  That scale like the technology was almost. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5873.84s)]
*  We don't understand what they were doing. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5879.04s)]
*  It's it's alien and not alien like human being, not like like nonhuman beings. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5881.4800000000005s)]
*  I think there were human beings that made it. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5886.04s)]
*  But I think to us, they went in a direction with their technology [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5887.68s)]
*  that's very different than we did. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5891.68s)]
*  We went in this weird direction of internal combustion engines and silicone [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5893.96s)]
*  chips and all these different things. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5897.72s)]
*  I think it's very likely that they had comparable, if not better technology, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5899.64s)]
*  but it moved in a completely different direction, whether it was using sound [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5903.4800000000005s)]
*  or vibration or some other completely undiscovered technology [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5906.52s)]
*  that we have yet to invent that was wiped out when civilization was knocked [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5911.08s)]
*  into barbarism. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5915.08s)]
*  And I think that's one of the reasons why you go back in early history. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5916.36s)]
*  People were so fucking savage because I think that the people that survived [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5918.759999999999s)]
*  that eleven thousand eight hundred years ago event, I think whatever was left [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5922.88s)]
*  was like fucking walking dead. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5927.28s)]
*  And I think people lived a horrible life for a long time. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5929.92s)]
*  I think it was thousands of years of this until we emerged from that [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5934.48s)]
*  and finally started reinventing agriculture and cities and all these different things again. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5939.639999999999s)]
*  So I think the six thousand year ago, Mark, I think if I had to guess, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5944.16s)]
*  I would imagine that is the first example of a rebuild of civilization. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5949.84s)]
*  It took thousands of years to emerge from horrific slaughter. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5954.84s)]
*  It wouldn't surprise me if all that doesn't happen again. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5958.92s)]
*  Like it could easily happen again if we get hit. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5961.4400000000005s)]
*  That was one of the initial things that really intrigued me reading. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5963.320000000001s)]
*  And I think it's it talks about an Ecclesiastes, but that that everything [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5966.4800000000005s)]
*  that's happened under the sun has already happened before and will happen again. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5971.08s)]
*  The generations that are yet to come will be forgotten about those that come after them. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5974.72s)]
*  Like it's I think just in the same way that we have that we have a summer [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5978.68s)]
*  and a fall and a winter and a spring. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5983.2s)]
*  It's like I think human society [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5986.0s)]
*  just because of our our human nature and like our pursuit for whatever it is [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5988.8s)]
*  that we want to like our we just love to create and develop. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5993.76s)]
*  And like so we'll we shoot all the way up to the top. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=5997.08s)]
*  And then some tragedy comes along, whether it's whether it's self-inflicted [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6000.04s)]
*  or from from comets or whatever. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6004.28s)]
*  And then there we go right back down to the bottom. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6006.76s)]
*  We start over again. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6008.36s)]
*  And yeah, like there is a lot of weird things like they've discovered a lot [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6009.88s)]
*  in South America recently because of the new technology, [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6012.92s)]
*  like the civilizations that existed down there that we had no idea about. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6015.16s)]
*  Like Graham Hancock's who knows what's going on even just on this ground [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6017.96s)]
*  in years past that we'll never know about. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6023.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6025.28s)]
*  Well, we know quite a bit about Texas, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6026.16s)]
*  which is a fascinating story of its own. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6028.5199999999995s)]
*  But, you know, what's really fascinating about Texas is they were dominating [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6031.32s)]
*  like these nomadic tribes are dominating this land for hundreds of years [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6036.88s)]
*  where people couldn't even settle down. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6040.64s)]
*  There's an amazing book called Empire of the Summer Moon. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6042.5599999999995s)]
*  It's all about Texas and the Comanches and the Texas Rangers. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6045.72s)]
*  Crazy stories. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6050.28s)]
*  Yeah, crazy. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6051.36s)]
*  But I think you I think what the Bible is saying rings true [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6052.68s)]
*  and that if people, you know, they just understood the history of the past [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6056.320000000001s)]
*  from when they wrote the Bible, they had to have known massive catastrophes. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6060.240000000001s)]
*  They had to. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6064.0s)]
*  But they believe that's what the story of the flood is from. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6064.64s)]
*  The flood from Noah's Ark and even from the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is even older. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6067.280000000001s)]
*  It's like they have these similar kind of stories. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6073.360000000001s)]
*  And they think that these similar kind of stories relate [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6076.400000000001s)]
*  to the immense flooding that occurred after impact. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6078.56s)]
*  They think that after impact, well, they know that at one point in time, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6081.839999999999s)]
*  the United States, half of it was covered with at least like a mile of ice. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6085.24s)]
*  Some places it was more than a mile, which is just insane to think. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6089.599999999999s)]
*  To think now. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6093.08s)]
*  Standing here and looking straight up for a mile cover in ice. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6093.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, how is how can you even wrap your head around that? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6098.16s)]
*  It's so difficult to even imagine. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6101.08s)]
*  And what's even yeah, it's crazy to think about it existing then, but also that [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6103.04s)]
*  like that's I guess when I talk about the intelligence of like [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6107.08s)]
*  whatever system it is we live in, the fact that the earth is able to [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6110.28s)]
*  self correct itself over a period of time. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6113.4s)]
*  It's like no matter. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6115.8s)]
*  And even today, when we see cycles and things happening, it's like [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6117.96s)]
*  I don't know that I'm sure that we could destroy the earth [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6122.4s)]
*  if with some of the technology we have now, like I I fear that we don't [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6124.84s)]
*  that this this sort of proxy war that we've involved ourselves [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6129.0s)]
*  and doesn't escalate into something bigger because [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6132.12s)]
*  we could really we could wipe society out indefinitely. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6135.44s)]
*  But we were talking about this yesterday with Peter Berg. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6138.48s)]
*  He's a director actor. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6141.599999999999s)]
*  He's got to did Lone Survivor, made that movie, made that painkiller show [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6144.28s)]
*  that's on Netflix. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6148.44s)]
*  And he did a tour of one of those battleships. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6149.5599999999995s)]
*  And he saw the missiles that could carry nuclear warheads. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6152.639999999999s)]
*  He's like, what the fuck? [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6155.719999999999s)]
*  Like one of these ships could literally wipe out the whole earth. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6157.16s)]
*  It's so bonkers. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6160.48s)]
*  It's so bonkers that these things exist and that there's thousands of thousands [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6161.599999999999s)]
*  of thousands of them ready to go, thousands of them. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6167.56s)]
*  And it's just flatten the planet. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6169.8s)]
*  That probably has happened before. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6172.4400000000005s)]
*  And if I had if I had to look at things with the most [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6174.88s)]
*  optimistic perspective. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6179.320000000001s)]
*  My most beautiful, optimistic perspective is that's what the aliens are here for. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6182.6s)]
*  That's the beautiful one is that life exists everywhere in the universe [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6188.64s)]
*  and that it's a very complicated process of evolving from territorial apes [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6193.200000000001s)]
*  to becoming these intergalactic travelers that have no ego [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6197.16s)]
*  and and don't display irrational behavior and work [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6201.72s)]
*  for whatever purpose, because that's where it gets weird. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6206.6s)]
*  It's like if you don't have emotions, you don't have jealousy and envy and love, [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6208.84s)]
*  love and lust and all the things to fight against and all the things to fight for. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6212.12s)]
*  If you don't have those things like what is purpose, what is our purpose as humans? [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6216.24s)]
*  It's very terrifying for us. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6221.04s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why we're most scared about technological innovation. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6222.360000000001s)]
*  Where comes that's Terminator. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6225.64s)]
*  You know, it's everything. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6227.12s)]
*  All these things that we create that wind up killing us [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6228.320000000001s)]
*  and that we are somehow or another purposeless [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6231.280000000001s)]
*  if we don't have all these things that we cling to like love and fear [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6234.360000000001s)]
*  and anxiety and jealousy and, you know, and all the stuff that we want. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6238.4800000000005s)]
*  We want to be praised and loved and all these different things [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6242.92s)]
*  that that motivate people to succeed and do things in life. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6246.96s)]
*  Without that, what are we? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6251.4800000000005s)]
*  That's a big question. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6253.240000000001s)]
*  But with it, how dangerous are we? [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6254.08s)]
*  We do use it in so many different beautiful ways, like your music or like, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6256.16s)]
*  you know, like a great book or like there's ways that people use this that are that are beautiful. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6261.96s)]
*  But it's ultimately the reason why life is so scary. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6268.5599999999995s)]
*  It's ultimately why why during the period of mass communication, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6271.36s)]
*  during the period of exchange of information worldwide, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6276.48s)]
*  which has occurred from the start of the 20th century to where we are in the 21st century. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6278.8s)]
*  We've never had a time where we could communicate with mass amounts of people better. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6285.12s)]
*  But it's still we're at the verge of nuclear catastrophe. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6289.400000000001s)]
*  It's still we're still in this very terrifying place [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6293.2s)]
*  where one group of people for some reason or another oppose this. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6297.08s)]
*  Like, I don't know anyone in Russia. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6301.16s)]
*  I don't know anyone in China. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6303.92s)]
*  The idea that somehow or another China is my enemy or Russia is my enemy. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6306.32s)]
*  Like, how? How did that happen? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6310.88s)]
*  You know, the people there aren't exactly. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6312.759999999999s)]
*  Exactly. So their establishment is an enemy of our establishment. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6315.08s)]
*  Right. The idea that what the human mind is capable of in creating great art and great music [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6318.5599999999995s)]
*  is also capable of dominating massive groups of people through tyranny. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6323.5199999999995s)]
*  We have to be very careful because that same thing that makes us this emotional being [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6327.84s)]
*  that wants all these weird feelings. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6333.0s)]
*  That's the same thing that leads us down the road to tyranny. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6336.0s)]
*  And I bet that exists everywhere in the universe. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6338.96s)]
*  And I bet the aliens, if they're coming down here, they want to be very careful with this species [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6342.280000000001s)]
*  while it's going through this transition, because I bet this shit is very touch and go. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6347.4400000000005s)]
*  And I bet every now and then some fucking Putin type character goes, oh, yeah, yeah, NATO. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6351.200000000001s)]
*  Fuck you. I have cancer. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6356.240000000001s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6358.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's also complicated because, yeah, like. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6360.4s)]
*  Scary. All that starts with someone's imagination, like all these. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6365.879999999999s)]
*  It all starts. And that's on the other end of that, though, to your point, it's like that's [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6371.32s)]
*  that's what I find so important about freedom of speech and the ability for people to have good, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6375.48s)]
*  honest conversations, because you can imagine the mind is just as capable of creating good as it is evil. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6380.0s)]
*  I think I think right now maybe we're creating a little more evil than we are good. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6386.44s)]
*  But I don't think so. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6390.4s)]
*  I think things can I think things can turn around just as quickly as they've turned bad [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6391.799999999999s)]
*  as far as on a global scale. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6396.839999999999s)]
*  I don't think we're creating more evil than we are good. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6399.24s)]
*  I think if you look at the statistics of history, human history, we're moving in a right [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6401.28s)]
*  direction, even though there's a lot of struggle. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6405.2s)]
*  It's not like a perfect curve. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6407.599999999999s)]
*  It goes up and down. But over time, if you look at just violent crime and horrible things [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6409.4s)]
*  that people do to each other, it's down almost everywhere in the world where it was [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6414.52s)]
*  a hundred years ago. And I think it's moving in that general direction. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6420.040000000001s)]
*  I just think it's messy. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6423.160000000001s)]
*  Human beings are we we fuck up a lot to get better. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6425.160000000001s)]
*  And we have to things have to like like I was having a conversation with a friend about [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6429.200000000001s)]
*  Nordstrom's closing in San Francisco. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6434.280000000001s)]
*  They get robbed so much. They just like we have to close up. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6436.080000000001s)]
*  It's so San Francisco. So crazy. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6438.400000000001s)]
*  It's so fucking crazy. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6440.12s)]
*  And and the person I was talking to was like, good, that they'll have to reassess now. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6442.24s)]
*  They have to realize their policies are crazy and they're going to have to put someone in [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6448.28s)]
*  here that fixes it. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6450.88s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. Or it becomes like a third world city. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6452.8s)]
*  Like some crazy, like violent crime ridden city that's controlled by gangs. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6456.76s)]
*  Like that could happen, too. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6462.68s)]
*  What do you feel like? See, to me, I perceive that as being a symptom. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6463.84s)]
*  Like, what's the what do you think the problem is? [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6469.2s)]
*  Like, I mean, I know the easy answer is it's the people that run the government in [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6471.320000000001s)]
*  California that have that have like made it into this atrocity that it is that it wasn't [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6475.64s)]
*  maybe 15 or 20 years ago. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6481.360000000001s)]
*  But like, there's also a big problem, too, with like homelessness and drugs and like. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6482.76s)]
*  Well, cynical me wants to think that there's a conspiracy. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6487.52s)]
*  Cynical me wants to think that if you create more prime, more problems, more crime, more [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6490.24s)]
*  confusing, then people will give in to more control by the government to somehow or [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6496.04s)]
*  another mitigate those problems that exist everywhere. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6502.6s)]
*  And there has to be a solution. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6505.72s)]
*  This is the only solution is that you have to have a digital ID. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6507.04s)]
*  You take it everywhere you go. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6510.12s)]
*  Everyone has a cell phone. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6511.28s)]
*  So if everyone has digital ID, that way we'll catch everyone when they're doing all [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6512.28s)]
*  these crimes. That's scary. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6515.44s)]
*  And you got to use it for that. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6517.84s)]
*  And then they're going to make up crimes. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6519.76s)]
*  They're going to decide that you saying things that they don't like that may even be [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6521.4s)]
*  true, like malinformation. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6524.96s)]
*  Like, that's a crime. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6526.96s)]
*  And then they'll shut down your social media. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6528.12s)]
*  And look, what we saw that during this, the Twitter files investigation from when [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6529.84s)]
*  Twitter first was purchased by Elon Musk and he let these journalists go over all the [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6536.8s)]
*  emails. Like, holy shit, the FBI is telling people to delete tweets. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6540.56s)]
*  This is nuts. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6544.32s)]
*  Again, it goes back to freedom. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6545.52s)]
*  They. Yeah, I can see that there's there is a power at the that wants to limit free [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6546.8s)]
*  speech. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6551.4s)]
*  Sure. People that have money that are that that are making money off of suppressing [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6552.04s)]
*  information and free speech is such a precious thing. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6556.92s)]
*  Like, that's something that that if we have anything, if we have something precious, a [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6559.48s)]
*  resource that needs to be protected more than anything right now, it's freedom of [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6564.24s)]
*  speech. It's a very important thing for this country. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6567.4s)]
*  And, you know, I've said it many, many times, but it's the reason why this country has [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6569.92s)]
*  created so much culture, the reason why there's so much. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6573.32s)]
*  Sure. And you and you've seen that you've seen that, like, spread out throughout the [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6575.64s)]
*  world, like, to your point, like, a hundred years ago, a lot of the even a lot of these [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6579.68s)]
*  countries, they're dealing with they've got radical politicians that are locking them [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6583.0s)]
*  down and taking away their rights. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6587.16s)]
*  And like, yeah, all that's happened within the last 10 or 15 years, maybe. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6588.56s)]
*  But in general, like the whatever craziness that we established here, like arguably the [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6592.04s)]
*  first country, I guess you'd say in modern history that had some form of democracy and [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6597.56s)]
*  some form of involvement of citizens deciding what it is they want, what the world they [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6603.400000000001s)]
*  want to live in. Like that spread out. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6608.0s)]
*  Like you see most all countries have some sort of you don't see a lot of kings and [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6609.48s)]
*  dictators running countries anymore. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6613.6s)]
*  They have an election cycle now, whether or not it's all credible or not, I don't know. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6615.12s)]
*  But, you know, the idea that, like, sovereign people can live in a land and decide what [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6619.8s)]
*  it is that they want for themselves is something that, like, has not existed. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6624.4s)]
*  It has not existed for a very long period of time in the world. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6629.72s)]
*  And it is precious that we hold to it. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6632.6s)]
*  And I guess going back to my point earlier about the federal government and state and [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6634.88s)]
*  local level, it's like I just think there needs to be more strength within local communities [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6638.32s)]
*  as far as people making decisions and uniting with one another. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6645.4800000000005s)]
*  And, you know, I've had a lot of people. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6648.64s)]
*  I'm the one ugly ginger is walking around like everybody's like, oh, is it that guy? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6651.16s)]
*  And so I've had a lot of people stop me on the street and in parking decks and at the [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6655.28s)]
*  airport and at the hardware store. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6659.56s)]
*  And like, you know how many times I've had now, at least a dozen times now, I've had [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6662.2s)]
*  people tell me that they're talking to people they haven't talked to in five or six years [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6666.96s)]
*  that they got pissed over politics about. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6670.88s)]
*  And just this message that's coming out has given them like I know a guy in my own personal [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6673.639999999999s)]
*  life, he hasn't talked to his brother in six years because they disagreed over Trump and [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6679.2s)]
*  Biden. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6683.44s)]
*  And even prior to that, like they just left and right. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6684.44s)]
*  Which one was the Biden guy? [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6687.5599999999995s)]
*  The guy I hang out with is because obviously I like I live out in the country. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6690.04s)]
*  I own guns. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6694.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, like I am the people in my neck of the woods are not despite what they may [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6695.64s)]
*  say on. Yeah. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6702.4400000000005s)]
*  Despite what they might say on a news organization somewhere like a lot of the people I hang [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6703.4800000000005s)]
*  out with in the area, the country I live in is is stereotypically red. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6707.0s)]
*  Right. Because a lot of people will vote no matter what other influences there are. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6711.92s)]
*  A lot of people will vote conservative just because of their Second Amendment rights, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6717.32s)]
*  which is very much under attack in Virginia. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6720.679999999999s)]
*  You know, like you remember about the sanctuary cities and all this, all the counties that [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6723.16s)]
*  decided, well, even if the federal government bans us, we're not going to enforce it type [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6726.759999999999s)]
*  of a thing, which is crazy to see like in our time. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6729.92s)]
*  But yeah, so he voted. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6733.5599999999995s)]
*  He was a big Trump guy and and he watched his certain news organization. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6735.08s)]
*  And then the other guy was for Biden and he watched his news organization. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6739.8s)]
*  So they just basically picked up whatever narratives they got from each other's news [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6743.2s)]
*  and they would just, you know, they let that destroy literally a friendship. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6747.72s)]
*  Yeah, they were brothers, you know, biological brothers. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6753.0s)]
*  And so so dumb. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6755.5599999999995s)]
*  That's that's not good for us as a country like that. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6757.44s)]
*  It's not it's not a wise thing to just apply to your life as a human being. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6761.68s)]
*  You can have people in your life that have disagreements with you. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6766.92s)]
*  I have people in my life that disagree with me on so many things. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6771.28s)]
*  Absolutely. On politics. Absolutely. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6775.8s)]
*  You know, especially like when I was a Bernie Sanders supporter, you know, there's so many [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6779.08s)]
*  people that are like, you're a fucking idiot. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6783.4s)]
*  Like, listen, I like to try it that way. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6785.12s)]
*  Let's try some guy who doesn't want war at all. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6789.4s)]
*  Let's try some guy who wants to take a certain percentage off speculation [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6791.4s)]
*  trades in the Wall Street where they're doing these and they're running a tiny fraction of a penny. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6795.92s)]
*  For each one of them. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6801.16s)]
*  And he's saying it would generate an insane amount of money that could be applied to education, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6802.28s)]
*  that could be applied to health care. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6806.64s)]
*  You could give people free health care. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6808.24s)]
*  You could give people free education. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6809.64s)]
*  Well, why wouldn't we do that? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6811.48s)]
*  If you got some guy who doesn't want to divert money to these fucking forever wars [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6813.5199999999995s)]
*  and instead wants to apply it to communities. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6818.44s)]
*  I was like, let's give that a chance. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6821.92s)]
*  Maybe it won't work. I don't know jack shit about politics, but I sincerely believe the guy. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6823.48s)]
*  And I'm like, that to me is at least an option for change. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6828.08s)]
*  And that guy had been the same guy his whole life. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6831.72s)]
*  He had been always pushing for that his whole life. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6834.68s)]
*  He's kind of gotten tired in his later years, but that's just understandable. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6837.68s)]
*  He's kind of like supported. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6841.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And so you believing in someone shouldn't. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6843.44s)]
*  Yeah. It shouldn't suspend your friendships or relationships with other people like that. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6846.64s)]
*  It's just you're hanging out with dummies. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6851.2s)]
*  People should have like I have many friends that are Trump supporters. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6854.76s)]
*  I have many friends that wholesale believe in the Democratic Party no matter what. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6858.360000000001s)]
*  It's a million times better no matter what anybody says. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6863.24s)]
*  And no matter what anybody says about the Biden family, the Trump family. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6866.04s)]
*  I've seen a lot of people change that now, though, in recent years, like even people who were [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6868.6s)]
*  hardcore conservatives and hardcore Democrats. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6872.56s)]
*  Like, I don't think whatever whatever a Republican, a Democrat was represented [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6875.6s)]
*  at some point in time is anymore. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6880.12s)]
*  Like both both both sides have. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6881.84s)]
*  I mean, like I said, I'm a I love freedom of speech and I love the Second Amendment, but. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6885.360000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of things that I see that I don't like. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6892.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, you got to think I'm 31, so I was in fourth grade at 9 11. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6895.56s)]
*  So we've been we were an endless war from 9 11 on. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6898.96s)]
*  And, you know, even when we shouldn't have been like. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6901.92s)]
*  So both sides have like just picked up on things and ran with it. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6906.92s)]
*  But they use certain emotional triggers to like keep their fan base happy, you know, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6910.04s)]
*  like the like, oh, they're going to take your guns. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6914.08s)]
*  And the other side, they've got all their emotional triggers and there are things that [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6916.36s)]
*  they're trying to feed their audience with. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6919.08s)]
*  But I guess like at the end of the day, it doesn't it doesn't help either side to pick [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6920.6s)]
*  like no. In my opinion, no one's no one. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6926.28s)]
*  No one can go into that position in politics in the White House or anything else for that [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6928.92s)]
*  matter at this point because of how just inefficient and how large the federal government is. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6933.76s)]
*  I don't think anybody can go into those positions and overnight save everything. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6938.24s)]
*  They can certainly make big influences. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6942.04s)]
*  I mean, you saw when Trump was in office, the economy was rocking. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6943.76s)]
*  But then other things he did, you know, like this thing like warp speed and all that, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6947.08s)]
*  like that. There was a lot of controversy around all of that. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6952.0s)]
*  And so, well, he would have to be a vaccine scientist to even understand what they were [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6954.44s)]
*  doing. And imagine being him. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6959.2s)]
*  Well, this is not to defend Donald Trump, but imagine being him and being in control [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6961.8s)]
*  of all of it. You're in control of the economy. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6968.24s)]
*  You're in control of foreign relations. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6971.64s)]
*  You're in control of the biggest military the world has ever known. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6973.8s)]
*  You're in the public eye. You're tweeting about your ex-girlfriend being a horse face. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6977.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, yeah, I don't think one person can do it. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6981.96s)]
*  There's so much shit going on in that guy's life. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6984.96s)]
*  Do you think that he had the time to investigate the efficacy of the covid vaccines that [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6987.32s)]
*  were this novel mRNA technology that never been applied to hundreds of millions of people? [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6993.04s)]
*  And then you had to trust the CDC and Fauci and all those people. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=6998.04s)]
*  Like, how could he know? [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7001.64s)]
*  Well, and that's a good example. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7002.6s)]
*  I don't think that one. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7004.64s)]
*  I don't think we can we can or should rely on one person to save all save us on all those [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7005.92s)]
*  issues. It's something we've got to work out on a personal level. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7010.52s)]
*  You know, well, it's insane. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7013.4s)]
*  It was invented back when people lived in tribes. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7015.12s)]
*  So you had a tribe of 50 people. You want that old guy? [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7018.68s)]
*  He's got a lot of scars in his face. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7020.92s)]
*  He knows how to run shit. He knows what to do wrong. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7022.4800000000005s)]
*  He knows what to do right. He survived. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7024.64s)]
*  All of his brothers died. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7026.48s)]
*  You know, like those guys are the guys you want teaching younger people. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7027.84s)]
*  It's like you're talking about with older folks. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7030.96s)]
*  That was the whole idea of a tribal leader. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7032.8s)]
*  Like, this is the greatest warrior. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7034.599999999999s)]
*  This is the smartest chief. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7036.08s)]
*  This is the person who's like they can lead us and they want nothing but good for us [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7037.36s)]
*  because they love us because they know us. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7041.16s)]
*  But I don't know you. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7042.92s)]
*  He don't know you. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7044.5599999999995s)]
*  You don't know. He don't know you. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7045.92s)]
*  He doesn't care. He just wants to get up there and say his speech the right way. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7047.12s)]
*  And then they give him ice cream. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7049.96s)]
*  And then he sits down like you see that woman is the White House press secretary. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7051.2s)]
*  I don't know if this is true, so we should find out if it's true. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7056.639999999999s)]
*  Did she or did she not accidentally delete a Biden tweet from her account? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7059.12s)]
*  So it's a tweet as president when I ran for president. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7065.32s)]
*  I just know she accidentally. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7067.92s)]
*  Yes. She accidentally posted it on the right. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7069.36s)]
*  I want to find out if that's true, though, because that could be Russian disinformation, [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7072.08s)]
*  because that's true, too. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7075.72s)]
*  Here's one of the reasons why free speech is so important in this country, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7076.68s)]
*  given the parameters of social media, is because we know that foreign interests [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7079.24s)]
*  are interfering with our discourse. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7084.96s)]
*  We know it. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7087.92s)]
*  It's proven that there's troll farms they have in Macedonia. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7089.28s)]
*  I'm sure they have them in China. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7093.04s)]
*  They have troll farms where people create accounts [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7094.32s)]
*  and then they argue with people about stuff. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7097.28s)]
*  And they'll post links to fake stories and they'll post fake information. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7099.4s)]
*  They may even post fucking AI voice swap shit. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7104.16s)]
*  But what they're doing is trying to get people arguing about stuff, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7107.8s)]
*  trying to get people to diminish their faith in democracy, [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7110.8s)]
*  trying to get people at each other's throats from the right and the left. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7114.32s)]
*  It's manipulated and think about who that benefits. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7117.2s)]
*  Investing in America means investing in all of America. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7120.92s)]
*  When I ran for president, I made a promise that I would leave no part of the country behind. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7124.08s)]
*  So she did do it. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7128.24s)]
*  She really did tweet it from her account. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7129.84s)]
*  Is that real? Oh, my God. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7131.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. She really did do it. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7135.08s)]
*  Oh, my God. That's so crazy. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7138.16s)]
*  So, of course, when you read his tweets, it sounds like her. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7140.84s)]
*  She's got a very politician way of doing it. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7145.04s)]
*  She's like an AM radio DJ, an AM radio DJ version of what a press secretary is. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7148.84s)]
*  Like a politician. Because, you know, AM, all right, here we are on the drive. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7157.0s)]
*  I'm Mike and I'm with the Rock, you know, or whatever. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7161.400000000001s)]
*  With fucking sidekick. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7163.96s)]
*  And maybe that's what attracted people to Trump and maybe what attracts people to like, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7165.280000000001s)]
*  see, thank God I haven't, especially now, at least I've got a good excuse [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7170.08s)]
*  not to keep up with politics anymore, because I've got a few other more important things on my plate. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7174.48s)]
*  But I think that's what attracts people to like that rough raw authentic type of speech. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7178.16s)]
*  Like, it's not clean cut and it's not professional. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7182.32s)]
*  But it's at least like you said, even with Bernie, which who knows? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7184.639999999999s)]
*  I don't know anything about Bernie, but he's not polished. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7188.2s)]
*  But at least what he's saying is like, at least you feel like he actually [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7191.08s)]
*  like, at least he actually believes it, because he believes it. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7193.92s)]
*  You look at you can look at politicians over a 15 year span and like they'll quote something from like, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7196.5599999999995s)]
*  oh, good God, I think anybody, any politician from the 90s is going to have a lot different opinions [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7202.839999999999s)]
*  on emotional triggers that we talk about today. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7207.08s)]
*  Politicians from the 90s, from the Democratic Party, sound like Nazis. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7209.679999999999s)]
*  They sound like Nazis. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7214.48s)]
*  There is this crazy, when Biden passed the crime bill in 94, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7216.16s)]
*  there's this famous speech that he gives about locking people up [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7220.5199999999995s)]
*  so that his wife is safe and so that they're safe and that I'm safe. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7224.92s)]
*  And it's it sounds like right ring, like Proud Boys speech. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7229.32s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7235.12s)]
*  It sounds like patriot speech. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7236.92s)]
*  Now, would you worry about militia say I don't I know very little about any of this. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7239.4s)]
*  But my understanding is even I know for sure with Hillary Clinton, but I think even with Obama, [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7243.28s)]
*  originally, their stance was very much against gay marriage and then it flipped around. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7249.04s)]
*  She didn't support gay marriage till 2013. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7253.24s)]
*  2013. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7257.12s)]
*  So like how can I pass them cigars? [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7259.32s)]
*  You're going to bust out your first cigar. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7261.28s)]
*  Yeah. So this is exciting. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7262.5599999999995s)]
*  So like I said, a fan gave me these at a show. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7264.28s)]
*  But yeah, so that's that's the thing. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7266.72s)]
*  I just hope I hope to see a fan gave me these. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7268.12s)]
*  How do we know they're not lace? [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7270.72s)]
*  Well, I'm going to let you go the way you try it first. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7272.0s)]
*  God damn it. Oh, they're sealed. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7274.84s)]
*  It definitely has to be real if it's sealed in plastic. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7277.12s)]
*  And it says it's from Cuba. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7279.88s)]
*  So it must be from Cuba. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7281.44s)]
*  I should have brought the note with him to give the guy a shout out. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7283.08s)]
*  That's my fault. But he's a cool guy. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7285.28s)]
*  He's a cool guy. Thanks for the cigars. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7286.76s)]

*  These are supposedly the real ones from Cuba. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7293.76s)]
*  But you know how hard that is to get like the real ones? [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7295.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of fake ones. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7298.5199999999995s)]
*  It's one of those things where for whatever reason, how do you tell the difference? [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7300.28s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not a cigar aficionado. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7303.32s)]
*  I like cigars. I can't even open a box. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7306.16s)]
*  That's also I suck. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7308.24s)]
*  I'm not a I like them, but I don't know jack shit about them. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7310.04s)]
*  Like my friend Bobby Kelly, he knows a lot about cigars. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7313.6s)]
*  He could tell you all that shit and he can he can answer all these questions. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7316.04s)]
*  But I know the good ones. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7320.08s)]

*  Like there's something about you piece of shit. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7324.08s)]
*  Sorry, we should have done this. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7327.08s)]
*  OK, I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7328.12s)]
*  I'm just trying to slice open this little cover with my sweaty hands. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7332.04s)]

*  Maybe he set us up and yeah, maybe he did. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7343.96s)]
*  Maybe it's a bomb. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7346.36s)]
*  Maybe it is. He said he's given us a bomb. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7347.28s)]
*  Maybe it's a sign this through security. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7349.96s)]
*  Yeah, maybe it's a sign that we are [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7351.96s)]
*  trying to preserve the looks of this box. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7354.36s)]
*  I'm out the window. Oh, I'm not worried about that. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7356.12s)]
*  Yeah, but everybody likes boxes in the cigar world. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7358.4s)]
*  People like they like the whole thing behind it. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7361.92s)]
*  They like cutting the cigar and smelling it. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7365.4s)]
*  And they like knowing that it came from some [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7367.64s)]
*  and it's hilarious. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7371.56s)]
*  Like the experience of it. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7374.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why I can't get into this box. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7375.8s)]
*  This is brutal. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7378.68s)]
*  It appears that this is a fake box. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7381.4800000000005s)]
*  We'll have to start with the. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7383.56s)]
*  Had to plan that out better next time. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7385.8s)]
*  Yeah, man, for real. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7387.400000000001s)]
*  I should give this to Jamie. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7390.04s)]
*  He'll figure it out. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7391.360000000001s)]
*  I see the seal on a different spot. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7392.08s)]
*  I think the top flips up. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7394.360000000001s)]

*  and I thought that that line was the seal. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7413.4400000000005s)]
*  This will be like a perfect YouTube short [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7419.320000000001s)]
*  of us trying to get the box open. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7421.400000000001s)]

*  Short anymore. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7424.64s)]
*  It's not short. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7425.6s)]
*  This is way too long. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7426.360000000001s)]
*  This is pathetic. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7427.52s)]
*  Come on, bitch. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7429.6s)]

*  I want to smell that. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7456.88s)]
*  That's what you got to do. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7458.639999999999s)]
*  You got to smell them. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7459.32s)]
*  This is what they do. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7460.28s)]
*  They take them, they put them by their nose. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7461.08s)]
*  It smells good. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7463.68s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7464.76s)]
*  Now we're going to have to find out if these are fake. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7465.92s)]
*  How do you know? [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7468.28s)]
*  Bill Burr says you just know. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7470.72s)]
*  You know, you know, I got some real ones. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7473.76s)]
*  Yeah, you fucking know. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7475.96s)]
*  Are you supposed to leave this on or slide this off? [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7478.0s)]
*  That's personal preference. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7480.92s)]
*  A lot of people leave them on. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7482.8s)]
*  Let's slide them off. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7484.0s)]
*  They seem a little ostentatious, a little ridiculous. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7484.84s)]
*  For a regular guy like yourself, yeah. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7487.56s)]
*  Yeah, for Joe Schumacher like me. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7489.8s)]
*  Now, real cigar people, you're going to have to do that by yourself [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7497.96s)]
*  because you got to kind of suck on it while you're doing that. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7501.68s)]
*  Real cigar people will tell you what you're really supposed to do [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7503.92s)]
*  before you even suck on it. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7506.64s)]
*  Is roll the flames around the end. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7508.280000000001s)]
*  So you should probably do it correctly because I didn't. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7510.84s)]
*  They'll get mad. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7513.28s)]
*  Yeah, you do that. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7513.96s)]
*  You get a little cooked. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7514.68s)]
*  Kind of get a little burned up. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7515.4400000000005s)]
*  Get a little cooked. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7516.32s)]
*  There you go. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7517.360000000001s)]
*  Now put it in your mouth and light it and suck on it at the same time. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7517.8s)]
*  And then you get a nice, nice bull. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7521.6s)]
*  This is yeah, I feel like I need to get some bullhorns for the hood of my truck. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7528.0s)]
*  Well, these might be legit. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7531.4400000000005s)]
*  Can I see that? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7535.8s)]
*  Here we go. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7539.0s)]
*  These are good. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7540.84s)]
*  You think they're good? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7547.32s)]
*  I mean, they seem good to me, but I wouldn't know the difference. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7548.64s)]
*  Yeah, like I said, I'm not an expert. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7551.52s)]
*  I don't even know how to open a box, but they're good in that they're smooth. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7554.08s)]
*  They're very smooth. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7560.68s)]
*  So if it really is from Cuba, there's only like there's a very small area [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7561.6s)]
*  where they grow these Cuban cigars. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7567.84s)]
*  Was it called a Balto viejo a balta or something like that? [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7570.12s)]
*  What is the area of Cuba? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7576.4s)]
*  It's like a bit. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7577.759999999999s)]
*  It's a very surprisingly small area where they grow the best cigars. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7578.12s)]
*  And it's just something about the soil that makes in the climate and everything's perfect. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7583.599999999999s)]
*  But they grow really good cigars in Nicaragua. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7588.36s)]
*  They grow really good cigars in the Dominican Republic. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7591.4s)]

*  That's the area. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7621.24s)]
*  So that one area just has bomb ass oil. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7622.12s)]
*  And they figured out a long time ago they grow the dopest cigars there. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7626.2s)]
*  Do you know that when the embargo happened with Cuba, [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7629.0s)]
*  JFK ordered a shit ton of cigars before the embargo? [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7631.88s)]
*  What a dirty bird. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7636.6s)]

*  I think it actually still had some of the cigar. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7656.8s)]
*  See if you could find that. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7659.08s)]
*  Maybe I'm imagining that. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7660.08s)]

*  Do you think I don't have you hunted before? [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7741.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, my that's what a lot of guys in the comments [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7743.6s)]
*  were saying on the Richmond North of Richmond video. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7747.160000000001s)]
*  They're like, I don't think that tree stand is going to be very good [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7749.120000000001s)]
*  this year with all that screaming and shouting. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7752.52s)]
*  Y'all were doing that. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7754.160000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I hunt on my land and I let people come in and hunt it. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7755.04s)]
*  I'm not I don't run dogs or anything, but that's real popular in Virginia. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7758.6s)]
*  So we'll do our thing at like early season and then we let the [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7762.08s)]
*  we let the club come in and run dogs at the end of the year. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7766.64s)]
*  You know, that's very controversial in Virginia. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7768.84s)]
*  There's like you want to talk about Coke and Pepsi politics. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7770.56s)]
*  Like that's definitely part of it. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7773.52s)]
*  You got people are very opposed to running dogs and you got some guys [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7774.64s)]
*  that just it's like it's such a long tradition. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7778.0s)]
*  You know, those two clash together. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7780.52s)]
*  But as far as like any of the big game, like the stuff we were checking out, [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7783.4800000000005s)]
*  and I'd love to I'd love to experience that once. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7786.6s)]
*  So do you use dogs to catch deer or what? [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7790.4400000000005s)]
*  They run the deer. They run the deer. Yeah. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7793.92s)]
*  So they they [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7796.360000000001s)]
*  they use them just to get the deer moving, which again, I don't [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7799.240000000001s)]
*  I don't know enough about it one way or the other. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7802.08s)]
*  But Virginia's got got a really healthy deer population, all things considered. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7805.360000000001s)]
*  Like I just think people think it's cruel. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7809.68s)]
*  You know, people think it's cruel when they do that with mountain lions, too. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7812.04s)]
*  But I was trying to explain to something, listen to somebody. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7815.88s)]
*  If you don't do that, you don't get mountain lions. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7818.52s)]
*  Like you're not going to find them. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7821.08s)]
*  They're they're they know you are coming long before you have any idea [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7823.08s)]
*  that they're and they're gone and they're smart. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7827.72s)]
*  See, I don't know if I'd want to kill a mountain lion. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7830.32s)]
*  I think I just want to like see, this is one thing people give me hell about. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7832.04s)]
*  But like we've got on my property, we've got coyotes and bear and bobcat. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7835.599999999999s)]
*  And we get them on camera a lot. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7840.04s)]
*  Like there's a huge bear we kept getting June and July. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7842.2s)]
*  It's like, man, I don't I don't think I'd want to shoot him. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7847.72s)]
*  I think I'd want to just just just admire him and let him go. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7850.36s)]
*  I don't know. Like, I'm just funny about that. Like, [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7853.48s)]
*  well, there's nothing wrong with not wanting to shoot an animal, you know, [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7856.8s)]
*  and if you don't want to shoot a bear. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7861.84s)]
*  Look, I've eaten bear, I've hunted bear. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7863.16s)]
*  Bear tastes good. You can eat bear. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7865.84s)]
*  But it's not my favorite thing to eat. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7867.76s)]
*  It's not. But it is also an animal that has to be managed. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7869.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. The thing about biological management, [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7873.2s)]
*  this is the uncomfortable truth of it. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7875.360000000001s)]
*  You have to have a balance. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7877.6s)]
*  There's wildlife biologists. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7879.12s)]
*  They observe populations and they want to enact [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7880.68s)]
*  some sort of a balance of predator and prey. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7884.76s)]
*  And we have an overabundance of predators in areas that are [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7887.68s)]
*  like when you have hunting that's off limits. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7891.64s)]
*  You create a really dangerous imbalance. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7894.12s)]
*  And they did that in all places of in New Jersey. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7895.92s)]
*  The governor of New Jersey ran on this platform of stopping the bear hunt [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7899.320000000001s)]
*  in New Jersey, because a lot of people in New Jersey, they live in urban [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7903.8s)]
*  environments like Newark and, you know, like hack and sack. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7906.64s)]
*  And like that's where the population is. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7911.0s)]
*  And like, we don't want you vote. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7912.84s)]
*  I mean, voting to kill bears. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7914.92s)]
*  Why would you kill bears? [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7917.08s)]
*  What they don't understand is like rural New Jersey [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7918.68s)]
*  has the highest bear per capita in the country. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7922.32s)]
*  There's more black bears in New Jersey than any other state, [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7926.84s)]
*  which is so nuts per capita. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7932.04s)]
*  I wonder why that is because they're fucking everywhere there. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7933.56s)]
*  And there's not a lot of hunting, you know. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7937.0s)]
*  So they had a bear season and this governor came in and stopped it. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7939.08s)]
*  It was part of the things that he ran on. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7945.72s)]
*  And then when he got into office, he realized after a while, like, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7947.56s)]
*  oh, my God, we have to kill these bears because like human [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7950.72s)]
*  bear interactions are going up. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7953.16s)]
*  A kid at Rutgers got killed by a fucking bear. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7954.72s)]
*  Like he was out in the woods near the campus and he got fucking slaughtered. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7957.72s)]
*  See, I always wonder if I'm going to get I think the bobcats [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7962.08s)]
*  psych me out more than anything. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7964.48s)]
*  I was the bear I'm OK with. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7965.76s)]
*  Like, I feel like they'll leave me well enough alone. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7967.56s)]
*  But until they don't. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7969.4800000000005s)]
*  I remember even when I when I first bought the place, [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7971.320000000001s)]
*  like right after I closed on it, because I'd had my house before that. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7973.92s)]
*  I had a house with five acres and like had the little homestead thing going. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7978.360000000001s)]
*  And we had like, you know, some basic stuff, horses and chickens. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7982.68s)]
*  And that's cool. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7986.160000000001s)]
*  But I knew I wanted more land. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7987.64s)]
*  And with everything, the way everything is like, [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7989.240000000001s)]
*  they're not making any more of it, you know. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7992.04s)]
*  So I said, I'll go ahead. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7993.96s)]
*  And that that caused that caused a lot of controversy with my better half. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=7995.16s)]
*  And I because she thought I was crazy that I was selling our [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8000.8s)]
*  like our comfortable house or living in to go buy land [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8003.52s)]
*  and stick a freaking camper on it until we can afford to build something. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8006.84s)]
*  But man, it's I remember my first weekend. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8009.76s)]
*  It was Memorial Day weekend of 2019 was like the first time I slept out there. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8012.76s)]
*  And I'd heard I knew what a coyote was, but I'd never heard a bobcat at night. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8017.88s)]
*  And it was me and the dogs. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8021.6s)]
*  And we were tent camping out there. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8022.68s)]
*  And it was like two in the morning as a bobcat, like right on us, [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8023.92s)]
*  doing that, you know, the noise they make. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8026.76s)]
*  What is the noise like? [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8029.08s)]
*  Sounds like a like a demented baby crying. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8030.16s)]
*  I don't know. It'd be cool to hear if people haven't heard it. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8033.52s)]
*  But it was in the dogs. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8035.88s)]
*  So we ended up leaving the middle of night because my dogs wouldn't stop barking. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8037.52s)]
*  But the bobcats are the only thing out there really freaks me out. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8040.400000000001s)]
*  Like one of them jumping on you. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8044.04s)]
*  I don't think they attack people, though. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8045.6s)]

*  Maybe they get going. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8059.8s)]
*  They live up to 12 years in the wild. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8063.72s)]

*  Wilderness like that when you're looking at mountains and stuff like that, [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8210.68s)]
*  it's some kind of medicine for the human mind. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8213.44s)]
*  This is something about the awe inspiring beauty of it and just the vastness of it. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8216.960000000001s)]

*  Yeah, well, you realize like, [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8235.48s)]

*  Yeah, they really are in the bigger scheme of things like [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8249.84s)]
*  it's a beautiful thing when you can because you find you really find peace in that. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8253.6s)]
*  But yeah, there's something about being out in nature. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8257.28s)]
*  I don't know. Like I've read all these things about, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8259.720000000001s)]

*  But there really is something just very peaceful about it. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8266.08s)]
*  Like and I found that even on my property, being able to just be out there [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8268.48s)]
*  in the woods just helped me tremendously with everything. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8272.48s)]
*  You know, I've been reading about like these different [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8275.4s)]
*  these different like healing centers and camps and things that they're using to try to. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8278.08s)]
*  It's for people like that are just getting out of rehab centers or PTSD or whatever. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8282.32s)]
*  But like they they have a lot some of these nonprofit organizations [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8287.439999999999s)]
*  where they take people out into that environment. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8290.08s)]
*  And it's it's they found a lot of benefit in it for people. But [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8292.0s)]
*  I'm looking forward to getting the experience just different parts of the country. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8297.439999999999s)]

*  Just they don't even realize they're working for you. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8425.28s)]
*  They're just making you more popular. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8427.72s)]
*  Well, the thing is, is like, yeah, I see a lot of the negative stuff online. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8429.24s)]
*  But man, if you if you read through my my emails and my social media messages [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8431.96s)]
*  and the people I've talked to on the street, like there's no question that [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8436.08s)]
*  there's no question that the majority of people perceive it in the way [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8439.28s)]
*  that I hope that it was that it would be perceived. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8442.08s)]
*  Yeah, no question. No question. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8444.12s)]
*  You know, think about that. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8446.04s)]
*  No matter what you do, you can't make everybody happy. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8447.44s)]
*  No matter what you do, no matter who it is. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8449.64s)]
*  There's always going to be people that don't like it. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8451.8s)]
*  It's in everything and in music and comedy and literature and films. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8453.56s)]
*  There's always going to be people that don't like things you like. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8458.679999999998s)]
*  It's always going to be people. And that's OK. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8460.72s)]
*  That's OK. Just don't have to read it. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8463.24s)]
*  Like the thing is about your things that people are going to [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8464.72s)]
*  people are going to write about you now, like you don't want to like [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8468.32s)]
*  inject that negativity into your mind. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8471.48s)]
*  So just don't read it. You don't have to read it. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8473.88s)]
*  But it's so they don't like you said this. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8475.759999999998s)]
*  So they think you said of that should have done this. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8479.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No, shut up. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8481.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny, though, like I. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8483.24s)]
*  But they're allowed to do that, too. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8485.24s)]
*  That's that's their job. Yeah. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8486.36s)]
*  And like and that's what I've said, even with people at certain [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8488.32s)]
*  organizations that I strongly disagree with that have reached out [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8490.72s)]
*  trying to do interviews or even some of the people that have come out [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8493.279999999999s)]
*  with the hit pieces and I'm like, look, I respect what you're trying to do. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8496.4s)]
*  Same way with the people in the music industry that have approached me. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8499.199999999999s)]
*  It's like I don't necessarily want to work with your organization, [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8501.4s)]
*  but I respect you for what you're doing. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8503.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they're just trying to earn an income just like anybody else. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8505.16s)]
*  You know, and they're stuck in a system. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8508.199999999999s)]
*  Everybody's got a boss. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8510.0s)]
*  You know, if you're doing a show on CNN, you're you're in a system. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8511.32s)]
*  That's what you're doing. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8515.96s)]
*  You know, you work for a system. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8516.88s)]
*  There's no way around that. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8518.16s)]
*  You are part of a gigantic corporation that is a very specific [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8519.64s)]
*  kind of news that it does. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8523.52s)]
*  And you're you're told how you're supposed to do this. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8524.88s)]
*  And you're hired accordingly and you know what your job is. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8528.32s)]
*  And it's not it's not you representing you. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8530.88s)]
*  And I think what your music, [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8534.6s)]
*  one of the reasons why I represented or why I resonated rather with people [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8537.84s)]
*  is because it represents them. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8541.32s)]
*  It represents humans like a real human being. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8542.640000000001s)]
*  This isn't just some bullshit hit written by a is a real human. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8544.92s)]
*  Well, I don't know. Right on the Internet that it was a [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8549.08s)]
*  you probably could, but I don't think you'd put the fudge rounds in there. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8552.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that doesn't seem like I would be that creative. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8556.04s)]
*  It made those things rhyme. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8558.84s)]
*  It's it's funny that that was one that was the most controversial. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8560.640000000001s)]
*  I really thought when I because it's funny, like to just, I guess, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8564.04s)]
*  just to tell the story about the song and how it was written, it was like [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8567.640000000001s)]
*  I had the first again this that song to me. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8570.68s)]
*  We weren't even I was I didn't even want to record that song [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8573.560000000001s)]
*  when Draven from Radio WV came down. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8576.28s)]
*  He had hit me up on a Thursday about coming to do the recording. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8578.2s)]
*  And I'd watched a lot of Radio WV, like [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8582.240000000002s)]
*  Logan Hallstead and a few of the Nolan Taylor. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8586.320000000002s)]
*  Like those guys are just they're some of my recent favorites. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8589.04s)]
*  And they were all sort of debuted on this channel. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8592.44s)]
*  And so I've been watching them for years. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8594.68s)]
*  And a guy gave a guy on Tick Tock [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8596.36s)]
*  got me in contact with him. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8601.04s)]
*  And so he called me on a Thursday. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8602.960000000001s)]
*  He wanted to come that Saturday and record. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8604.92s)]
*  And I only had the first half of Richmond, North of Richmond even written. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8607.12s)]
*  It was on my it was on my tick tock. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8610.08s)]
*  I was sitting in my bathroom, like just halfheartedly singing through the word. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8612.24s)]
*  I didn't even know if I was going to just when stuff comes in my head. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8615.12s)]
*  A lot of times I would just post part of it online just as like [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8618.480000000001s)]
*  to get it out there, you know, very casually. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8621.84s)]
*  And everybody in the comments is like, oh, you got to finish this one, whatever. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8624.119999999999s)]
*  And then Draven was insistent that we needed to do that song because I didn't. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8626.84s)]
*  My my top song in my head was Ain't Got a Dollar. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8629.84s)]
*  Ain't Got a Dollar and I Want to Go Home are like two of my favorites. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8632.92s)]
*  So I just threw the rest of the song together. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8636.32s)]
*  I finished it the day we recorded it around six thirty on a Saturday. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8639.759999999998s)]
*  And I had had the song finished at like three o'clock on a Saturday. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8643.4s)]
*  So it was very thrown together. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8646.92s)]
*  Had no idea that was going to be the one. Wow. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8648.48s)]
*  And Alex, I was a little reluctant to even record it because I was like, [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8651.2s)]
*  I'm not really an anthem song kind of guy. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8655.12s)]
*  A lot of my other songs are different than that. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8657.04s)]
*  So, I mean, I'm glad he I'm glad he had the insight to tell me to do it. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8659.28s)]
*  But yeah, it's just kind of funny the way it was thrown together. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8663.480000000001s)]
*  But really, I thought when we uploaded the song, I thought the controversy [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8666.320000000002s)]
*  and it was going to be more around the first line in the second verse than anything [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8669.84s)]
*  about miners on an island somewhere. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8675.0s)]
*  Like, I thought that was that what people got upset about, too. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8677.480000000001s)]
*  What's interesting is left people on the left got upset about that one. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8679.92s)]
*  Like, why is he talking about miners and why wouldn't you be talking about it? [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8684.56s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8688.0s)]

*  Like, why wouldn't why would that be a thing that's controversial to sing about? [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8691.48s)]
*  And why would it be like something that left wing people would be upset about? [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8695.4s)]
*  Like, what? Yeah, I hope that people I hope and I've seen it happen. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8698.24s)]
*  Like a lot of people like I want to go home. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8703.04s)]
*  I've seen that one's got like some million views on it and whatever. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8706.16s)]
*  And that's awesome. But yeah, Richmond, North of Richmond isn't really even my [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8709.08s)]
*  my favorite pick, like my and I'll get a better version uploaded of it at some point. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8713.4s)]
*  Right now, it's just off my phone. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8717.92s)]
*  But like I'd say my favorite song that talks about [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8719.12s)]
*  like class and politics in the world and like the way I perceive it is probably Dog on it. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8723.08s)]
*  Like Dog on it is probably my favorite out of any of them. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8728.6s)]
*  So I'm excited to like get those songs released in a more professional format [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8731.6s)]
*  the way Richmond, North of Richmond is. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8735.28s)]
*  And I've got notebooks just full of stuff written down. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8736.76s)]
*  So I've got a lot of ideas of new songs that I want to work on. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8740.48s)]
*  So I'm really excited to get and I hope that like it's good that we did this interview [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8743.880000000001s)]
*  and that we got to get on here and talk. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8748.28s)]
*  But I'm not I don't want to talk a whole lot anymore. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8749.92s)]
*  I don't think like you don't have to. I'm not a talker. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8752.24s)]
*  I'm a I'm a writer. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8754.960000000001s)]
*  And so I hope moving forward that I'll just be able to communicate with people [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8756.12s)]
*  just through music and not worry so much about doing interviews and stuff like that. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8760.2s)]
*  Because well, I think you made an excellent account of yourself. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8763.72s)]
*  And people are going to understand who you really are. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8766.76s)]
*  And you know, and it's a cool story. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8769.0s)]
*  It's fun. I think more people are going to be behind you now than even before. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8771.36s)]
*  They'll get a sense of this is a magical thing for you. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8774.68s)]
*  And it's beautiful. And if it can happen to you, if you can pursue a dream and do this, [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8778.12s)]
*  other people can do things that are very similar. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8784.24s)]
*  Exactly. I mean, if there's if there is a message to get out of all of this, [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8786.04s)]
*  it's just that you don't need anybody to do what it is you want to do. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8789.36s)]
*  Like I'm just a guy that wrote some songs. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8792.880000000001s)]
*  I took I recorded them on my phone. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8795.24s)]
*  I uploaded them through Distro Kid. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8797.12s)]
*  And like, here I am. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8798.8s)]
*  And it doesn't matter what your pursuit is. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8799.84s)]
*  Like you don't need some big industry [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8803.16s)]
*  fancy, schmancy, whatever, to back you up to do it. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8806.36s)]
*  You just want you just got to go do it. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8808.96s)]
*  You know, and I think there's so many people that are like [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8810.72s)]
*  and I know people like that that are very good at things. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8813.48s)]
*  But they say, oh, I'm not good. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8816.32s)]
*  And like the the fear holds a lot of people back from being successful. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8817.36s)]
*  You know, you're afraid of your fear of failure [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8822.320000000002s)]
*  will will keep you from being successful all day long. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8825.12s)]
*  So I hope that if anything resonates out of this, it's that that people [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8827.560000000001s)]
*  just do what you want to do and don't worry about if people are going to like it [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8831.52s)]
*  or not, they probably are, you know. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8834.12s)]
*  And if they don't make something better, [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8836.720000000001s)]
*  go back and try again. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8839.92s)]
*  Yeah, who cares if they don't? Yeah. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXqSnhNUE8&t=8841.24s)]
