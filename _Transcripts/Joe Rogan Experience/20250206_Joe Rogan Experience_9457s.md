# Joe Rogan Experience #2269 - Bret Weinstein
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up? Good to see you my friend. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=10.0s)]
*  Great to see you Joe. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=14.0s)]
*  Wild times. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=15.0s)]
*  Almost unbelievable. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, the last time you were here we were really worried about what was going to happen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=18.0s)]
*  And now it seems like we're in a completely different timeline. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=24.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have to say in addition to being just over-archingly worried about what was going to happen to the republic and to the globe, I was personally worried about what would happen to people like you and me if we lost. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, probably wouldn't be so good for business. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=41.0s)]
*  There probably would have cracked down. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=45.0s)]
*  There's that. But I must say on my darker days I had concerns even beyond that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=47.0s)]
*  And you probably should. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=53.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah, in light of what we now know. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=55.0s)]
*  You know, it's this USAID thing that's going on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=57.0s)]
*  You know, Mike Benz has been on that like a pit bull. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=60.0s)]
*  And I've been following him on X and he's going to come back on here and kind of explain everything. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=63.0s)]
*  But he explained it the last time he was here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=68.0s)]
*  And I don't think I really grasped it until Elon's six wizards. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=71.0s)]
*  They brought in some young wizards to go in there and go over the books and they are just finding crazy shit. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=77.0s)]
*  It's great. And it's so interesting. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=84.0s)]
*  I was listening to a left-wing podcast today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=86.0s)]
*  I like to mix it up. You know, I listen to all kinds of different stuff. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=89.0s)]
*  And it was like I was listening to a different world. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=92.0s)]
*  Like they weren't even talking about all of this corruption and all this obvious buying of influence. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=95.0s)]
*  Instead, they were talking about aid overseas and how people are going to starve and Mike. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=102.0s)]
*  Mind boggling. And there's also I have to say I'm just I'm upset at the general pattern of a failure to recognize how right those of us who hypothesized that there was a racket that had overtaken our entire governance structure. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=107.0s)]
*  We turn out to be absolutely right about this and no one's going to mention it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=127.0s)]
*  That that's mind blowing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=131.0s)]
*  It's very strange that the media is ignoring it, especially the left wing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=133.0s)]
*  It's just too big of a win for the right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=136.0s)]
*  And so they're just ignoring it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=138.0s)]
*  And then they're just highlighting the good things that USA did, which I'm sure that probably did probably had to do some good things to at least justify its existence. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=140.0s)]
*  As a cover story. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=149.0s)]
*  I'm not even sure. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=150.0s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't change anything. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=152.0s)]
*  Obviously, this was a mechanism used to funnel money to all sorts of things that we didn't vote on that don't make sense in light of our constitutional structure. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=155.0s)]
*  And I'm you know, I obviously have concerns like everybody else about where this train takes us. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=166.0s)]
*  But seeing that structure broken up is it's a huge relief. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=174.0s)]
*  They gave twenty seven million dollars to the George Soros Prosecutor Fund. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=181.0s)]
*  So our own government is funding this left wing lunatic who is hiring the most insane prosecutors who are letting people out of jail who commit violent crimes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=187.0s)]
*  And that's that's exactly how this racket worked is that the ability to tax the American public and then effectively get us to pay for being propagandized for being surveilled. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=200.0s)]
*  That that's the game. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=216.0s)]
*  And I don't know what era we currently live in. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=218.0s)]
*  Obviously, there's a lot that's confusing about what the Trump administration is up to. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=222.0s)]
*  But I don't think any reasonable person could be unhappy that we are exiting that era. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=227.0s)]
*  I'm going to read off some of the things that this guy Ken Dakota the great on Twitter listed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=233.0s)]
*  And this is off the Jesse water show USAID. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=239.0s)]
*  Twenty million dollars for Iraqi Sesame Street. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=243.0s)]
*  Two million dollars for Moroccan pottery classes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=246.0s)]
*  Eleven million dollars to tell Vietnam to stop burning trash. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=249.0s)]
*  Twenty seven million dollars to give gift bags to illegals. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=253.0s)]
*  Twenty seven million dollars. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=257.0s)]
*  Three hundred and thirty million dollars to help Afghanis grow crops crops. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=259.0s)]
*  Wonder what those crops are. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=265.0s)]
*  What's the biggest crop bread. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=267.0s)]
*  It's going to be the poppy seeds for bagels. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=268.0s)]
*  Three hundred million dollars. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=270.0s)]
*  Two hundred million dollars on an unused Afghani dam. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=274.0s)]
*  Two hundred fifty million dollars on an unused Afghani road. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=278.0s)]
*  This is why you'll. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=282.0s)]
*  I mean, some of this stuff is really, really crazy. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=286.0s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=291.0s)]
*  And, you know, USAID is, of course, riddled through whatever international madness it is that caused us to open our southern border. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=292.0s)]
*  And facilitate an invasion through the Darien Gap. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=299.0s)]
*  So, you know, seeing that structure laid bare is it almost feels like it can't be real. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=303.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, it can't have been this close to the surface. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=312.0s)]
*  And yet here we are. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=314.0s)]
*  They were spending is this number correct? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=316.0s)]
*  I think the number that I read was six hundred million dollars every two months to ship in illegals. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=319.0s)]
*  Sounds right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=326.0s)]
*  I don't know the number offhand, but. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=327.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=330.0s)]
*  Well, you have to you have to realize that basically we had a shadow apparatus functioning and it involves all kinds of things. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=332.0s)]
*  It involves payoffs to people who didn't deserve them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=343.0s)]
*  It involves contracting to entities that were necessary to get the work done. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=346.0s)]
*  So I don't think we can properly understand what these numbers mean and what they're actually being used for. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=354.0s)]
*  But it was a racket. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=361.0s)]
*  Well, we were always wondering, like, why is our debt so high? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=363.0s)]
*  Why is the national debt so high? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=366.0s)]
*  Like, why is our deficit so insane? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=369.0s)]
*  Well, this is it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=372.0s)]
*  This is it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=373.0s)]
*  I mean, the how about the one where they paid two hundred thirty six billion dollars like for chargers? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=374.0s)]
*  Do you know that they were trying to set up chargers? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=384.0s)]
*  You mean car chargers and they only built a couple of these me forty billion dollars for electric carports. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=386.0s)]
*  Eight ports have been built. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=393.0s)]
*  You know how crazy that is. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=396.0s)]
*  Forty billion dollars. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=397.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=399.0s)]
*  Carports. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=400.0s)]
*  But I have to say, as much as this is shocking, I wasn't surprised. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=401.0s)]
*  I thought that effectively our entire system had been turned into a racket and that we were basically being fed a cover story from it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=407.0s)]
*  And it's weird to now have the evidence of this. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=417.0s)]
*  But I think it was apparent that whatever had taken over our system wasn't interested in the well-being of average people, that it was interested in the power of the state to take people's resources and redistribute them and that that really is what's been going on for most of our adult lives. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=421.0s)]
*  And it's also important to note that this progressive left leaning, like radical left arm of the government of the country was manufactured. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=443.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=453.0s)]
*  It's all manufactured. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=454.0s)]
*  It's all manufactured and supported. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=456.0s)]
*  It's not organic, which is really fascinating about the other side, because the other side, the reaction to it is organic. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=458.0s)]
*  Like, say what you want about the Trump administration and what you think about him. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=465.0s)]
*  That was an organic shift where people were like, E fuck enough. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=471.0s)]
*  Enough. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=475.0s)]
*  Yes, it was an overdue reaction. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=477.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=481.0s)]
*  The cover story that what we were up to was writing past wrongs was so pernicious and pervasive that it was hard to get our footing to challenge it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=482.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=495.0s)]
*  But it shouldn't really be surprising that that movement wasn't organic. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=496.0s)]
*  Of course it was induced. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=501.0s)]
*  And we're going to be waking up to the magnitude of that theft for quite some time. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=503.0s)]
*  Have you ever heard of the audience effect? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=512.0s)]
*  It is a psychological theory that our behavior changes when we know we're being watched. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=514.0s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=519.0s)]
*  We are being watched when you use the Internet. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=520.0s)]
*  Data brokers watch and record everything you do online, even if you're using a private browser. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=524.0s)]
*  But you don't have to become a slave to the digital surveillance state. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=530.0s)]
*  You can free yourself with ExpressVPN. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=534.0s)]
*  With ExpressVPN, 100% of your online activity is rerouted through secure encrypted servers that hide your IP address. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=537.0s)]

*  ExpressVPN is easy to use. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=549.0s)]

*  I think this is going to take years. Chamath said that it's going to be like Iran contra on steroids. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=588.0s)]
*  That's what he said. He said when you get to the bottom of all this, it's going to be insane because they haven't even got to the Medicaid yet. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=593.0s)]
*  They haven't even got to the medical stuff. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=599.0s)]
*  There's so much they haven't even tapped into where they think the real motherlode of fraud is. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=601.0s)]
*  Yes. And I must say that there is also another aspect to this which we have to be careful about, which is that the the justifiable anger at discovering what it is that we've been dragged into as a nation is going to make it hard to see where the limits ought to be in terms of upending this stuff. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=607.0s)]
*  In other words, at the moment, I'm cheering for the wrecking ball. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=630.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=633.0s)]
*  Break this stuff up. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=634.0s)]
*  That's going to happen ever again. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=635.0s)]
*  But there are. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=637.0s)]
*  What's that, Jamie? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=639.0s)]
*  Reading the spending on the Chargers. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=640.0s)]
*  They said that they haven't actually. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=643.0s)]
*  According to this, they haven't actually spent all that money yet. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=644.0s)]
*  What do they do with it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=648.0s)]
*  It's they've spent some of it to make some of those things, but it's just that hasn't been allocated yet. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=649.0s)]
*  So long article going through all the spending that's been done. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=654.0s)]
*  It's on factcheck.org. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=658.0s)]
*  Factcheck.org who runs that. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=661.0s)]
*  Some of the chargers have been made some of them are on the way to be making they built 61 at 15 stations [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=663.0s)]
*  Since mid-august or through mid-august fourteen thousand nine hundred more currently in some stage of development [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=667.92s)]
*  But that's where it goes into like where they are what they have to be done and who's getting the money from them has to [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=673.56s)]
*  Be done through a long process [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=678.12s)]
*  from each state [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=680.12s)]
*  Yeah, the question is how can we get a proper accounting as you bring out who the hell is factcheck.org? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=681.92s)]
*  That's a problem with fact-checking organizations that should really be illegal like I think if you're a fact-checking organization [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=688.0s)]
*  We should have stringent rules on what influence is being peddled like what who's paying for these fact-checkers? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=695.0s)]
*  Who's behind the scenes? What is the term? It should be very transparent [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=703.12s)]
*  How did you determine whether or not this was true or false? You know because [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=706.92s)]
*  There are a lot of things that get said like I don't know if you saw this but Elizabeth Warren got confronted and it's on [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=711.84s)]
*  Twitter this morning. She got confronted about the amount of money that she's received from pharmaceutical drug companies [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=717.88s)]
*  She said she's never received any money from pharmaceutical drug companies and never received any monies from any packs [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=724.86s)]
*  And then of course underneath that community note strikes again, and of course she received millions. Yeah, she's a fucking liar [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=730.28s)]
*  Well, and it you know, it's an arms race, you know [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=737.24s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=739.52s)]
*  How can pharma cloak the money that it's giving so that there's plausible? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=739.68s)]
*  Deniability at the point that that Elizabeth Warren is confronted or Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders was hilarious only 1.5 billion [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=743.72s)]
*  Only 1.5 million out of 200 million only 1.5 [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=751.0s)]
*  Yep, that's what I saw as well [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=755.1600000000001s)]
*  Only the hard-working people the hard-working people in this country gave me money [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=757.44s)]
*  Well, I don't think I don't think the Democrats understand [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=762.12s)]
*  That it's over and that there was a vast infrastructure that made their feeble [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=767.4399999999999s)]
*  Arguments viable and that infrastructure is now collapsing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=773.24s)]
*  People are far more aware and their lives aren't gonna function anymore [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=777.68s)]
*  Well, it makes sense now that we're seeing these numbers because okay [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=782.1999999999999s)]
*  This was what was funding the infrastructure now we get it because it wasn't otherwise. It's organic [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=784.78s)]
*  This is the will of the people. This is how people are moving. It's not it wasn't that at all [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=791.04s)]
*  This was all organic and it was really about control and money [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=794.6999999999999s)]
*  It had nothing to do with helping people making people better giving aid to foreign countries [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=798.78s)]
*  That's all a cloak and dagger bullshit show. The reality was it's about money. Yeah, it's well [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=803.9s)]
*  It's always it's always about power and limited resources [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=809.06s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=812.1s)]
*  This was a new game taking place at a level that was hard to believe and therefore many of us couldn't see it [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=812.62s)]
*  Did you see how they used software to map out? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=819.06s)]
*  55,000 different NGOs that were used as a branch of the democratic system. No, I didn't catch that I [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=822.94s)]
*  Could send it to you. I think I said to you Jamie, right? We went over it on the podcast before [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=829.86s)]
*  It's so nutty that this was all kind of like hidden until they started using software to try to like figure out like well [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=833.74s)]
*  In and map out where all the influence goes and the crazy thing about the NGOs [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=840.26s)]
*  And this is one of the things that Mike Benz has gone like so deep into it [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=845.1800000000001s)]
*  It's essentially like they contributed to Democratic Party the government pays them [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=848.38s)]
*  It's like it's all this like weird sort of like circular money transfer thing. That's out in the open [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=853.46s)]
*  No, it's a it's a positive feedback. The whole idea is power is [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=859.9s)]
*  Utilized to free resources that garner more power and it is the exact inverse of the system that we are supposed to have [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=865.5s)]
*  Yeah [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=873.3000000000001s)]
*  It's very interesting where we're headed [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=874.4200000000001s)]
*  That's a harder question. Well, we're headed is we're gonna own Gaza [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=877.38s)]
*  Somehow this is it so fractal technology maps previously hidden connections between [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=882.54s)]
*  55,000 liberal NGOs revealing how tax dollars allegedly flowed through major institutions like Vanguard and Morgan Morgan Stanley to groups [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=888.3s)]
*  Like the Chinese Progressive Association this breakthrough tracking system can now monitor every dollar going to every NGO [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=895.9s)]
*  Exposing intricate funding webs that traditional tech couldn't detect [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=902.74s)]
*  So an example black voters matter funds four million dollar distribution network was invisible until quantum mapping revealed dozens of subsidiary [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=906.86s)]
*  organizations the unprecedented mapping reveals a pre-zit previously hidden web of financial relationships [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=916.02s)]
*  And that's what it's really all about. Yes. The problem is I [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=922.78s)]
*  you know sometimes when I see like a list of [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=927.6600000000001s)]
*  preposterous [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=931.58s)]
*  Scientific projects that have gotten big grants. Mm-hmm. I read it and I think I [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=932.82s)]
*  Some of they all sound preposterous [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=939.62s)]
*  but I don't know some of these things are likely to have had a good explanation and [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=941.78s)]
*  it just is not apparent in the sound bite and some of them are every bit as preposterous as as [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=946.46s)]
*  They seem and so I can't look at a map like that and say what I would expect if the system was healthy [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=952.0600000000001s)]
*  So I'm I'm cautious about it. I I don't think the system was healthy [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=958.66s)]
*  I think the system was a racket from one end to the other and I've been saying that we've been living in the era of [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=962.26s)]
*  Malignant governance where there's basically no element of this you couldn't turn off and make us better, but [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=967.54s)]
*  We have to be suspicious also of our [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=974.86s)]
*  Understanding of how a properly functioning system would graph in some something like that [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=978.74s)]
*  So that we don't we don't overrun the train station when we get there right and [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=984.7800000000001s)]
*  I will just say I was I was talking to a friend of mine who runs an Alaska native corporation [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=991.0200000000001s)]
*  which I don't know if we've talked about Alaska native corporations before but this is a [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=997.1s)]
*  a [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1002.6600000000001s)]
*  corporation the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1003.98s)]
*  It competes for federal contracts [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1005.9000000000001s)]
*  It has some advantages in the competition for federal contracts and all of the profits go to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1008.3s)]
*  Alaska natives and it is finding itself in a very difficult to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1015.3s)]
*  navigate battle because of all of the successes of Doge so [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1022.26s)]
*  the Alaska native corporation is [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1029.06s)]
*  Utilizing something called the 8a program the 8a program is a program that gives [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1032.1000000000001s)]
*  advantages to disadvantaged people and at some point that [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1038.7800000000002s)]
*  Ability to use the 8a program was granted to Alaska native corporations [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1043.5400000000002s)]
*  Well, the 8a program is now under attack by some large corporations federal contractors who do not like [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1049.8600000000001s)]
*  Competition from things like Alaska native corporations and it is being portrayed as if it was based on race, which it isn't [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1057.74s)]
*  Anybody can use it. It's not a race-based program, but because people are in a mood to dismantle all of this [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1066.06s)]
*  left wing solution making corruption [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1073.86s)]
*  the these mega corporations are finding it easy to target the 8a program and they are persuading members of Congress that [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1077.82s)]
*  It doesn't belong and this is going to be a tragic loss if this program which works [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1086.1399999999999s)]
*  Well is dismantled in the fervor to go after all of the stuff that should never have been [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1091.86s)]
*  What does this program do exactly it provides a? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1097.1799999999998s)]
*  mechanism for [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1101.72s)]
*  disadvantaged people to [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1103.4199999999998s)]
*  Compete for grants. It's really not race-based anybody, you know, so would you just have to live in Alaska? No, no [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1105.86s)]
*  So there are two separate things Alaska native corporations are for Alaska natives, right? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1112.46s)]
*  When you say Alaska natives, you mean people who live in Alaska or no, no, I mean [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1118.1000000000001s)]
*  Arctic peoples Arctic people. Yes, so the original people of Alaska before we bought it for 50 bucks [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1123.82s)]
*  Exactly. We bought it for 50 bucks from the Russians and then the after the discovery of oil in Prudhoe Bay [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1129.94s)]
*  The US government realized that it could not afford to give the natives of Alaska [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1136.3400000000001s)]
*  Sovereign land rights because it was going to need to do things like put a pipeline to [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1143.3s)]
*  Transport oil so instead of giving them reservations and sovereign land rights it gave them [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1148.7s)]
*  some [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1156.6200000000001s)]
*  Abilities to compete for federal contracts as Alaska native corporations [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1157.9s)]
*  It's an interesting program that does a lot of good [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1163.78s)]
*  But its connection to the 8a program now has [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1167.54s)]
*  The good that it does in jeopardy and I don't know how many stories there are like that, but we need to be [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1171.1799999999998s)]
*  Careful that our excitement about watching all of this nonsense torn apart [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1179.34s)]
*  Doesn't cause us to tear apart things that actually are functioning well and don't suffer from the the defects of the DEI madness [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1185.22s)]
*  Got it. So this thing that allows disadvantaged people to get grants like how is it structured? Oh that I couldn't tell you [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1193.26s)]
*  That I couldn't tell you we could look into it. It's it's easy to look up. It's the 8a program [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1200.5s)]
*  Help small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to compete for federal contracts provides training and technical [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1206.9s)]
*  Assistance to help businesses compete categorizes eligible businesses as veteran owned women owned minority owned or owned by a person with disabilities [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1214.78s)]

*  There are quite a number of success stories that [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1277.2s)]
*  This is exactly what we want for [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1281.14s)]
*  Disadvantaged people right we want a real social safety net [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1283.82s)]
*  Yeah, not only a social safety net but something that provides an opportunity. Hey build a business right? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1288.1s)]
*  This is what we want you to do [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1293.8999999999999s)]
*  This is the mythology of our system is you know pull yourself out of your disadvantaged state [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1294.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so that you don't need help. Yeah, so anyway [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1299.78s)]
*  We should we should be interested in maintaining those programs at the same time [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1303.1s)]
*  We find the stuff that's actual nonsense and get rid of it as quickly as possible [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1306.94s)]
*  And that's gonna be a delicate balance so far [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1311.9s)]
*  We're so we're early in this process and you're gonna have you know big wins like the revelations about USAID [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1314.74s)]
*  But the day will come soon enough when we're talking about [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1322.7s)]
*  Discussions where we actually have to do a cost-benefit analysis on the programs that are targeted right and we have to realize that there are [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1327.26s)]
*  Programs that benefit people greatly and are really good for the entire country as a whole absolutely and that's that's like the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1334.38s)]
*  problem when you like if you want to if you're a left-wing progressive person like we both sort of [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1342.3400000000001s)]
*  Identified with up until a while ago, and then all of a sudden the entire country takes a polar shift [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1347.94s)]
*  You don't want to lose your own [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1352.94s)]
*  ideas about what's important and what things that we should contribute to with our tax dollars because like I think we both agree that [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1355.66s)]
*  There's a lot of there's a lot of good in taking taxes and providing social safety nets [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1363.9s)]
*  providing food for poor people and homeless people like helping people [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1371.26s)]
*  Welfare all these things are important for like to not have people starving on your fucking streets [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1375.74s)]
*  Like all that stuff is like we we're gonna have a community which is essentially what a country supposed to be an enormous [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1380.9s)]
*  Community we have to support the members of our community [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1386.7800000000002s)]
*  We just have to do it without grifters and do it without bullshit and do it without it being just a [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1389.52s)]
*  Cleverly disguised ruse in order to gain political power [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1395.52s)]
*  Well, you may remember years ago [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1399.48s)]
*  I used to say that I want to live in a country so good that I get to be a conservative [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1401.72s)]
*  Alright, I'm a liberal because there's a lot of problems with the way our system works [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1408.84s)]
*  But the objective of all of that progressivism ought to be a system that doesn't require [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1413.2s)]
*  Intervention in that way, you know in which everybody does have access to the market and so people really can be [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1418.9599999999998s)]
*  Responsible for you know lifting themselves out of whatever literally the rising tide lifts all boats [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1425.6399999999999s)]
*  Which should be everybody's thought process? Yeah a fair system [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1431.32s)]
*  Yeah, which everybody starts out with the tools that allow them to take advantage of the market [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1435.4799999999998s)]
*  That's great. And I want a system in which lazy people [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1440.0s)]
*  Don't have yeah money to spend and are motivated to become unlazy. I don't want people profiting from [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1444.36s)]
*  destroying opportunities that belong to other people [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1453.0s)]
*  But if we had a system that was like that and everybody had the tools to utilize it [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1455.76s)]
*  Then we should want as little intervention as possible. Yeah [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1461.28s)]
*  wild times [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1465.56s)]
*  Just wild like what a fun time to be alive. I [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1467.28s)]
*  It just feels different I have to tell you I [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1471.68s)]
*  Don't know what's coming but it's at least it's at least [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1475.24s)]
*  delightful [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1480.3600000000001s)]
*  Not to know what to think. Yeah, right the the cynicism that was required to understand what was going on two months ago [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1481.3600000000001s)]
*  Is now no longer required. You actually have to think about what you're [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1489.88s)]
*  What you're told is coming down the pike and think well, I don't know. Is that a solution is it? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1494.64s)]
*  Yeah, is it a negotiating tactic or is it a solution that's actually being proposed and would it work and right? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1499.36s)]
*  Like are we really taking over Gaza or is this just a bullshit? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1504.8799999999999s)]
*  Marketing ploy like what is this like some negotiation tactic with Israel like what? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1508.9199999999998s)]
*  Cuz like the look on Netanyahu's face when Trump was talking about taking over Gaza [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1513.76s)]
*  It was like what you could see his face. He was just like [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1519.8799999999999s)]
*  What the fuck you say? I have to say I [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1524.1599999999999s)]
*  Almost feel like it was worth the price of admission right there just to watch his face [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1527.64s)]
*  Yeah, like you want to let us in. Oh, you want us help? Okay, we're gonna set up bases there and instead of you know [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1532.04s)]
*  Someone was describing this on Twitter instead of a response time to any action Israel takes taking days. It takes minutes [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1538.9s)]
*  Well, I I am NOT a fan of Netanyahu's as you probably know [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1545.44s)]
*  My sense is that he the relationship of Netanyahu to the Israeli [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1550.9s)]
*  Population is more or less like the Biden administration to the US population. Well, they were even more even more [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1556.88s)]
*  Against it because they were protesting in the street hundreds of thousands of people up until October 7th [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1564.82s)]
*  You know that was one of the reasons [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1569.58s)]
*  Apparently why they think they got their pants down or they had their got caught with their pants down in October 7th [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1572.1000000000001s)]
*  Because they had so many troops that were around these protests [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1577.5s)]
*  So they had hundreds of thousands of people protesting in the streets because Netanyahu was trying to expand his powers [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1580.74s)]
*  And this just so happened to put him back in charge [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1586.06s)]
*  But in any case to see him back on his heels [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1590.26s)]
*  That was a that was a good sign now I am of course [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1595.14s)]
*  Concerned about the idea of I'm not even sure I know what I heard right. We're gonna make Gaza [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1598.74s)]

*  Yeah, and the fact that we were living in the era of malignant governance and that [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1715.48s)]
*  basically, I'm concerned as somebody who believes in good governance that there's almost no component of this that you couldn't remove and [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1722.2s)]
*  Create an improvement that that's not a message you want. I want a message in which we [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1732.0s)]
*  govern as lightly as possible [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1737.96s)]
*  But we do it really really well and an era in which you can cut off any limb and the patient gets healthier that [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1739.68s)]
*  Teaches the wrong lesson about governance it it teaches the lessons that that governance was a mistake to begin with which it wasn't right [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1747.96s)]

*  And this is a real problem because if it was just the only way you could win [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1856.12s)]
*  It was you had to do for the will of the people [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1860.8s)]
*  It you had to literally do things that were better for the people the people realize you're doing a great job and they keep [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1863.4s)]
*  Electing you well, let's be honest about what the conservatives had right from the get-go [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1869.3s)]
*  There are problems that only competition solves [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1876.12s)]
*  There are other problems that competition in something like a market is not well positioned to solve but there's certain problems that there's just [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1881.2s)]
*  There's no second best. It's only competition that works. And so when we talk about well, you know, what are we gonna do for fact-checking? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1887.94s)]
*  we're gonna abandon the idea of fact-checking what you want is a [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1895.8s)]
*  vibrant [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1901.4s)]
*  Independent journalist sector in which people who spot the story early and people who articulate the story in the most [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1902.8s)]
*  intuitive and accurate way out compete those who do a worse job so that over time what we get is [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1912.0s)]
*  Journalism that you can't [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1919.08s)]
*  Fool right and that it reveals to us which government programs actually work even if they don't sound reasonable at first glance [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1921.84s)]
*  Here's what's really going on behind the scenes in this program, right? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1929.34s)]
*  And then journalism that exposes any kind of fraud and I don't know about you but as I was watching [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1933.1s)]
*  confirmation hearings [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1940.5s)]
*  My sense was that the Elizabeth Warrens and the Bernie Sanders were [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1943.1799999999998s)]
*  Dinosaurs who do not understand [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1950.82s)]
*  that [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1954.3799999999999s)]
*  The earth has just been hit from outer space and that they don't live in the world that they are so used to [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1955.86s)]
*  that their corruption was [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1962.3799999999999s)]
*  Immediately apparent and they're not used to that. They're used to having a whole phony journalistic layer that [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1965.78s)]
*  covers for them, right and [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1972.58s)]
*  That layer is gone and the American public is awake and it's angry and rightfully so and now [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1974.8999999999999s)]
*  It looks at Bernie Sanders who you know [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1981.74s)]
*  I remember the first time you and I spoke you and I had both been Sanders supporters [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1983.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and now to see that same guy [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1988.7s)]
*  Going after Bobby Kennedy and you know the feeble excuse. Well, what if Bobby Kennedy becomes the head of HHS and [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=1992.66s)]
*  People don't have access to prescription drugs and it's like [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2002.66s)]
*  Dude I just lived through kovat [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2007.08s)]
*  It's not obvious to me that they wouldn't get healthier if they didn't have access to prescription drugs [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2009.6799999999998s)]
*  Do you realize how corrupt those companies are and how? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2014.84s)]
*  Nonsensical their science is the science that says that you actually get better if you take a [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2018.84s)]
*  Staton based on some metric in your chart, right? So I'm not arguing that there aren't good pharmaceuticals [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2023.9599999999998s)]
*  they're undoubtedly are but what's the net effect of our [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2030.4399999999998s)]
*  Pharmaceutical obsessed medical culture. It's not obvious to me that it's positive [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2035.6000000000001s)]
*  I think it may well be negative and so anyway again, I see Bernie Sanders and I see him [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2040.1200000000001s)]
*  reading from a script that is no longer [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2046.4s)]
*  Relevant to the movie we're watching right and this is not saying that there aren't some pharmaceutical drugs that are amazing [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2049.96s)]
*  The problem is they're not all amazing and they sell them all like they're amazing. Absolutely [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2056.32s)]
*  That's the problem some of them are great like Viagra is fantastic like it's really good stuff [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2061.4s)]
*  There's a bunch of stuff like that that really works. There's a bunch of drugs that really help people [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2065.46s)]
*  There's a bunch of drugs that brilliant scientists have developed that definitely help people live longer and live healthier lives [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2070.28s)]
*  But also they're in the business of selling medicine selling [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2078.2000000000003s)]
*  Pharmaceutical drugs and so there's a lot of stuff that they sell that is not good not good for you [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2083.26s)]
*  Overall net negative when you look at the amount of drugs that get pulled that get [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2088.48s)]
*  Endorsed and then supported by the FDA and then they have to pull them wasn't it like 30% something in the range [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2094.12s)]
*  Yes, and that is the tip of the iceberg [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2102.08s)]
*  We do not have just as we don't have a journalistic layer that exposes [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2105.48s)]
*  people in Congress who are lying to us and [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2111.16s)]
*  Aspects of the government that are corrupt we don't have a university system that can properly do [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2113.56s)]
*  Science and can be relied on to tell us what the impact of a drug or a food additive is [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2121.68s)]
*  Right. The whole system is missing an action, right? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2127.8s)]
*  The whole system is paid for by the pharmaceutical drug companies. They pay for tests. They pay for studies. They support [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2131.2000000000003s)]
*  Organizations that are supposed to be regulating them. The whole thing is bananas [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2137.7200000000003s)]
*  Everything that is supposed to evaluate something like safety or efficacy or [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2141.96s)]
*  Analyzed net effects anything like that has been captured by the PR wing and [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2149.56s)]
*  so the consumer is in no position to [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2157.7599999999998s)]
*  To navigate a world like that. I mean and we know that this [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2162.12s)]
*  encompasses everything, you know how many people's doctors are [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2167.24s)]
*  Pharma skeptical [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2171.36s)]
*  Right. Your doctor should be very pharmaceutical. I don't know that this drug is actually a benefit to you [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2173.6400000000003s)]
*  But know that the doctors have become pushers, right? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2178.52s)]
*  Because they've been compromised and and also I mean that's literally the system that they're created from [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2181.6800000000003s)]
*  they're sent out into the hospitals immediately with that and [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2188.6400000000003s)]
*  It just it's so difficult for a doctor to step outside of the system and be independent when they do they get attacked [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2193.04s)]
*  Like how many doctors lost their licenses because they were trying to prescribe ivermectin to people who had kovat [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2198.72s)]
*  Yeah, almost all of the doctors who were any good found themselves chased out of a job or with [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2204.0s)]
*  yeah, pretty to their license or slandered in in the media and [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2209.72s)]
*  You know my I'm sure you're in the same position [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2214.4s)]
*  Those are frankly the only doctors I trust at this point were the ones who were willing to pay a price to tell me the truth [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2217.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah my doctor that I know out here want a case [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2222.48s)]
*  But they were about to lose their license [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2227.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's that's and just for prescribing ivermectin. No, that should that should be your first question [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2230.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, is how did you do over kovat? Yeah, and if they have nothing interesting to say [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2236.0s)]
*  I would just turn around and walk out the door [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2242.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, imagine going to a doctor right now and they're telling you you should get your kovat shots. You should stay up-to-date [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2244.6s)]
*  Imagine well, I find that bad, but at least I know how to interpret that what I don't [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2249.14s)]
*  Understand is what I'm supposed to do with the doctor who did recommend the shots [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2255.46s)]
*  has stopped recommending them and has not [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2260.78s)]
*  Talked about said something about the change in their perspective. Yeah. Yeah [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2265.38s)]
*  I have a problem with that with social media influencers to hundred percent people that were pushing it and then have not [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2270.62s)]
*  Publicly correct, of course. I've not said I was wrong and this is why I was wrong [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2276.58s)]
*  Like I can't fuck with you anymore [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2280.58s)]
*  If you if you can't say that you were wrong about that then I don't I just can't a hundred percent [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2282.58s)]
*  It is a it is a test of integrity and you wouldn't want to go to a doctor that didn't have [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2289.2599999999998s)]
*  High integrity at a moment like this your doctor needs unusually high levels of integrity and what we've seen is unusually low levels [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2295.42s)]
*  and the same thing with [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2301.7s)]
*  Social media influencers as you called them [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2304.8199999999997s)]
*  Anybody in the public sphere should go back and they should do an accounting of [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2307.78s)]
*  What they said what they thought how they got there how that played out in the end [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2313.22s)]
*  When they changed their mind and what they said about it publicly. Yeah, right [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2318.5s)]
*  I I must say I'm constantly in a battle with [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2322.84s)]
*  The ultra cynics who claim to have gotten everything right during kovat because basically they never believe anything [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2326.66s)]
*  It's not a method you got lucky right you got lucky so it happens double into a full con game [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2333.18s)]
*  You've stumbled into a con game and yes, you didn't buy it [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2339.14s)]
*  But that's not a demonstration that you know how to think through the next one, right? Right, correct doesn't demonstrate anything, right? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2342.02s)]
*  so what I really want are people who had a good track record and who know what mistakes they made and [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2349.2599999999998s)]
*  Know how not to make them in the future [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2356.2599999999998s)]
*  Those are the people that we should be paying attention to. Yeah, that's a good point [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2358.46s)]
*  It's um, it's a fun time though [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2362.74s)]
*  It's fun because things are actually happening [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2365.7s)]
*  Which is very different than most of the time when people get elected [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2367.9399999999996s)]
*  most of the time when people get elected they claim all these things and they're running for president then they get into office and [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2371.2599999999998s)]
*  not much changes and [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2376.7799999999997s)]
*  in fact a lot of what they [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2379.02s)]
*  Campaigned on they don't practice at all like a great example is the Obama administration [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2382.18s)]
*  The hope and change website had to be changed because there was a bunch of stuff in there about whistleblowers [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2387.2599999999998s)]
*  Protecting whistleblowers, which they didn't do at all. They were some of the worst [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2393.9s)]
*  There was one of the worst administrations for whistleblowers hundred percent. Yeah [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2396.98s)]
*  Well, I think what we have seen over our you and I are about the same age what we have seen over our entire lifetime is [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2400.94s)]
*  that [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2409.8199999999997s)]
*  Elections can change the jerseys, but they just swap [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2411.2999999999997s)]
*  You know who's in power and who's out of power? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2415.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, the point is the system is in power and you know the people in the the roles to deliver the speeches change [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2418.54s)]
*  But they're just basically trading off and so I have the sense that you and I are now watching [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2424.9399999999996s)]
*  the first the outcome of the first genuine election since [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2432.02s)]
*  1963 yeah, I've heard that argued that 63 when they assassinated Kennedy [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2437.2999999999997s)]
*  That was the last time we had a real president was an actual person who was trying to change things and put things in [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2442.18s)]
*  Put things in a position where he felt it was beneficial to the entire country, right and it [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2451.14s)]
*  Changes the feel of this in two ways [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2459.2999999999997s)]
*  one of them is just just unfamiliar to us because we've been watching theater for our entire lives and being told that it was [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2461.62s)]
*  The transfer of power and the other is that there's a lot of [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2468.48s)]
*  pent-up need for change because you've effectively had a [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2472.76s)]
*  cryptic power structure that never gets displaced that has gotten so entrenched that rooting it out takes [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2477.76s)]
*  frankly an [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2485.6000000000004s)]
*  extraordinary in every sense of the word person like Donald Trump and an extraordinary team [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2487.6000000000004s)]
*  Imagine if he's doing this imagine is trying to do doge without Elon [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2494.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, I so you know Heather and I took a lot of flack after [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2497.86s)]
*  the assassination the first assassination attempt [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2504.18s)]
*  of Trump where we both [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2507.82s)]
*  Perceived I think we were actually perceiving this before but the the assassination attempt really kicked it off [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2511.2200000000003s)]
*  We perceived that this was a different person than the first administration's [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2515.96s)]
*  Trump that he had matured and [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2521.5s)]
*  He had been he had been forged by you know [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2525.04s)]
*  all of the lawfare that had been deployed against him and that it had been good for him and in fact, I [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2528.7400000000002s)]
*  Hate to say this because I have my doubts of course about [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2535.4s)]
*  the election of 2020 but I [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2540.48s)]
*  Don't think what he is currently doing would have been possible if he had won and been inaugurated in 2020 [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2545.56s)]
*  I think you're right [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2553.46s)]
*  I think also the public witness supported it if they didn't see four years of the Biden administration how crazy everything was yeah [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2554.02s)]
*  and then having gone through kovat and watching the economy collapsed and [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2560.2s)]
*  Watching, you know hurricanes coming is like the most important thing for hurricanes to get vaccinated [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2563.58s)]
*  I do now that you mention can we get vaccinated? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2570.26s)]
*  Yeah, very important the everything's harder [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2574.78s)]
*  Everything everything [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2578.7s)]
*  The [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2581.1s)]
*  We lived in a movie a bad one. We went through a fucking crazy [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2583.1s)]
*  Cohen brothers kind of apocalyptic movie a poorly written [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2589.98s)]
*  poorly directed movie. Yeah with you know an extraordinary [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2595.14s)]
*  budget and [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2600.8999999999996s)]
*  Almost no need to pay attention to continuity. It was weird. It was bad [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2602.2599999999998s)]
*  But at least we know but I think that really woke a lot of people up, you know [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2608.5s)]
*  So called red-pilled a lot of people I think that that four years was important to get to where we are now [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2612.62s)]
*  It was essential where most people are aware [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2618.68s)]
*  like I think if you had gone to 2018 and and had like a real conversation with most people in this country about [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2621.06s)]
*  The level of corruption it would be a fraction of what they believe it to be now fraction [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2629.66s)]
*  I know this to be true because [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2635.44s)]
*  You know, I tried to [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2638.36s)]
*  To spark unity 2020 and make it work and you're banned on Twitter. I [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2640.84s)]
*  was [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2646.6s)]
*  Explain that to people because I want to think the difference between the new Twitter [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2648.0s)]
*  Thank God for Elon Musk and the old Twitter the old Twitter you guys [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2651.3s)]
*  Tried to put together a unity party where you would get the best [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2655.76s)]
*  Representatives from the left and the right together for the good of the country and like that's dangerous [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2659.8s)]
*  It's dangerous and they even lied about us. They said that we were engaged in inauthentic behavior [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2666.0s)]
*  Basically, they accused us of using bots [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2672.6s)]
*  Which we didn't so anyway, that's the world [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2675.56s)]
*  We we were in in 2020 and headed to a more controlling more world, right and then in [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2679.0s)]
*  2024 [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2686.52s)]
*  You know, there's what I think of as a continuation of the same idea [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2688.04s)]
*  Right, there's you know, rescue the Republic was what it looked like in 2024 and the point is that actually worked [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2693.3799999999997s)]
*  That was an organic unity movement and it took advantage of the fact that you know, maha had already [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2699.98s)]
*  catalyzed as [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2707.94s)]
*  as [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2709.3799999999997s)]
*  Kennedy and Trump had gotten together and so that was huge [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2710.2999999999997s)]
*  That was a huge part of it because Kennedy had so many supporters even in many states [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2713.66s)]
*  He was like bordering like 25 30 percent [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2718.04s)]
*  Which is really crazy for an independent and when he went over to Trump and then all those people like oh my god [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2720.96s)]
*  I have hope now people who are vaccine injured people were very skeptical about certain pharmaceutical drugs that may have caused them harm [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2726.48s)]
*  People who knew Bobby's history of being an environmental attorney and all the amazing work that he did then [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2734.02s)]
*  Those people got on board with the Trump administration and I think that was huge and now with Tulsi [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2740.72s)]
*  I think that's huge as well. I think you know when when Elon took over Doge that was like the final Avenger [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2746.56s)]
*  like having that team together is such a unique team where you have [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2754.96s)]
*  prominent former Democrats former eight-time Democrat for eight years Democrat Congresswoman who also [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2760.48s)]
*  Served overseas in a mill in a medical unit twice. Like this is you've got an extraordinary [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2768.2s)]
*  Group of human beings [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2775.28s)]
*  Extraordinary group of human beings all of whom I think took very real risks [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2777.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah at the very least with their reputations. Well, Tulsi got put on a terrorist watch list, of course [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2783.6400000000003s)]
*  Which is fucking crazy and it was a gamble each of these people, you know [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2789.3s)]
*  Kennedy Musk Tulsi they knew that they were taking that risk and it was clear that they were motivated by [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2794.4s)]
*  Patriotism that they actually I mean this is what a soldier does right? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2803.7200000000003s)]
*  You know that you're taking risks for something that matters [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2808.32s)]
*  More than you yes, and you know to watch Elon to it. I think also [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2812.48s)]
*  Was just remarkable because of course in Elon's position [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2818.0s)]
*  He could he could have done, you know what Zuckerberg does [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2822.32s)]
*  Right and he could have played it safe and kept his options open and done what he was told [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2826.44s)]
*  And you know apologize for it later sort of right that wasn't what Musk did [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2831.4s)]
*  he actually had the courage of his convictions a as many people have noted his [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2837.64s)]
*  liberation of X [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2844.48s)]
*  Set the stage for this election to even happen that there wasn't anything you could put over on us that we couldn't [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2846.8s)]
*  unpack and [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2854.48s)]
*  You know crowdsource a better interpretation of on X and even if most people weren't on X [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2855.76s)]
*  It was enough that they their narrative engine just didn't work right [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2861.24s)]
*  If you look at it a viral post on X a viral post about something that's very important like that has to do with USAID [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2866.4s)]
*  You will see seven million eight million views ten million views. There is nothing equivalent like that to mainstream media [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2873.68s)]
*  There's nothing even close [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2880.92s)]
*  There's nothing even close maybe a very viral YouTube clip [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2882.68s)]
*  But these are every day all day long there's posts that have seven million five million three million and [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2887.58s)]
*  People are reposting them as well and sharing them and and taking the information and posting them, you know without credit [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2894.62s)]
*  There's a lot of that going on [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2901.3799999999997s)]
*  So there's the actual amount of the information that gets out is [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2903.04s)]
*  Far more than it would have ever happened without Elon taking over Twitter [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2906.8199999999997s)]
*  It's probably changed the course of our civilization in a way that nothing else could have done yes [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2911.5s)]
*  and I think it's a little bit deceptive because [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2917.8199999999997s)]
*  Its size doesn't quite explain its impact [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2921.06s)]
*  But it's a little bit like the higher reasoning centers of the brain like there's a collective [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2924.94s)]
*  Consciousness in which we figure out what we think is true and it's been downstream of this amazing [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2932.22s)]
*  propaganda engine [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2938.5s)]
*  Well, we're now learning to spot the propaganda and to understand what it really means and to figure out what it's cloaking and [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2940.22s)]
*  A lot of that is happening on Twitter because it can and it's actually forcing [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2948.1s)]
*  You know Facebook to come around right, right? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2953.66s)]
*  Which of course, you know [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2957.02s)]
*  I usually say that zero is a special number meaning in a world with no [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2958.66s)]
*  Social media platforms where you can speak freely and reason with others [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2963.5s)]
*  There's no pressure to start doing that but once you have one any [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2967.84s)]
*  Social media platform that doesn't allow you to speak free freely. Is it a competitive disadvantage? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2972.7200000000003s)]
*  And so, you know Elon freeing X actually liberated the others and they were beginning to move in the right direction which [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2977.0s)]
*  Frankly is part of why this era just feels different. Yeah, it's it's very interesting times and then on top of that [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2985.0s)]
*  We're being invaded by UFOs. So it's all happening. I have not noticed that [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2992.2000000000003s)]
*  Are you watching News Nation what's wrong with you? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=2998.2400000000002s)]
*  You're so not informed. I [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3001.36s)]
*  Am not informed. I am I'm waiting for some sort of compelling evidence that something [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3003.92s)]
*  Extraterrestrial is going on. I'm talking to everybody and the more people I talked to the less I know [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3010.0400000000004s)]
*  There's that more information I get from all these people that have had UFO and alien encounters and experiences and whistleblowers [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3014.6000000000004s)]
*  And the more I talk to them the less I feel like I know I [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3021.88s)]
*  Do not feel like it's and then on top of that I'm in the middle of Jacques VallÃ©e's books [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3026.1200000000003s)]
*  Which are very wild like Jacques VallÃ©e. I had him on the podcast a long time ago and he's coming back on again [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3030.76s)]
*  but the first time I had him on I only knew him as the French scientist that had [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3036.6800000000003s)]
*  The he that the character in closing counters of the first kind was based on him [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3042.32s)]
*  Do you know the character the French character that brings together the military to try to communicate with the aliens? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3047.1600000000003s)]
*  It's based on Jacques VallÃ©e who's been studying UFOs [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3051.98s)]
*  like for decades like from the since like the 50s in the 60s and [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3055.48s)]
*  Boy the more you read about his take on things the more it's very confusing [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3061.16s)]
*  Because these fucking stories are the same stories that have been going on for hundreds of years. They're not even modern [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3066.04s)]
*  You know we we think of them we think of like Kenneth Arnold seeing the flying saucers and coining the phrase in the 1950s [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3072.76s)]
*  Like no, no, these stories have been like real similar for hundreds of years [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3079.76s)]
*  That some there's some phenomenon that people occasionally encounter and it's real similar [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3084.96s)]
*  It says similar like it's similar enough from people that weren't aware of the narrative [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3091.28s)]
*  That you have to wonder what the fuck is actually going on [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3098.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think you do have to wonder what the fuck is actually going on on the other hand. I think there's a whole range of possibilities [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3102.04s)]
*  that [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3109.8s)]
*  Don't involve [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3111.28s)]
*  Anything extraterrestrial I think there's a bunch of shit that doesn't involve anything [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3113.0s)]
*  extraterrestrial that's happening at the same time as a bunch of shit that we don't have explanations for well [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3119.32s)]
*  That's what I think you would you wouldn't [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3125.76s)]
*  That would not be shocking if there was something to cover [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3128.88s)]
*  You might decide instead of trying to keep it under wraps you would bury it in so much low-quality bullshit [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3132.72s)]
*  Yes, that nobody be able to find it. That's what it feels like to me [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3138.8s)]
*  That's what it feels like to me. It feels like to me that this is [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3142.02s)]
*  There's a lot of people that I think are trying to do the right thing a lot of whistleblowers that are really trying to educate [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3145.9399999999996s)]
*  The American public, but I don't know who they really are doing the bidding of I don't know they even know [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3151.14s)]
*  I think if I was the government, let's pretend that I was some gigantic [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3156.62s)]
*  Arm of the military industrial complex and I had [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3162.62s)]
*  Some literal recovered flying saucers [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3166.86s)]
*  I would come up with the dumbest fucking stories and put them in binders and leave them on desks and [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3169.7599999999998s)]
*  Hope that these people leak this shit and the more dumb shit they leak the more the actual reality of what we possess [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3176.62s)]
*  Like let's say if the government [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3183.22s)]
*  Really did find a flying saucer in the 1940s really did back in it back engineer the propulsion system [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3185.86s)]
*  Really did apply it to drones and they really are flying them around and they have them [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3191.96s)]
*  Well, what I would do I would make up some [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3196.6s)]
*  crazy shit about you know a mothership that's [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3200.12s)]
*  47 years away and it's coming and it's as big as a planet and I would come up with the wackiest stuff [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3204.28s)]
*  Possible and like get it all out there put it all out there. We have 57 different species on a [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3210.8s)]
*  Fucking freezer somewhere and Wright Patterson Air Force Base and I just like [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3217.04s)]
*  Ramp up the bullshit in as many ways as possible, you know [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3222.48s)]
*  They've controlled all our nuclear test codes and they hover over our facilities were powerless to control them [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3225.9s)]
*  I would say everything as wacky and crazy as possible [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3231.16s)]
*  So I could keep flying around these gravity propulsion vehicles that we've developed [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3234.84s)]
*  Well, I must tell you I'm not I'm skeptical that those vehicles are vehicles [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3240.48s)]
*  What do you think they are? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3246.56s)]
*  projections [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3248.12s)]
*  Projections. Yeah in what way but what if you could monitor them on if you see them on radar if they visual [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3249.44s)]
*  They've seen them going into the water. Like what is I'm having a deja vu moment here or we've discussed this before [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3257.68s)]
*  I don't know which it is but [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3263.44s)]
*  the basic rubric is [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3265.2799999999997s)]
*  Physical stuff [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3269.12s)]
*  displaces air [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3271.08s)]
*  which means it makes noise when it moves and [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3273.04s)]
*  Right. I [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3276.0s)]
*  Don't quite see the logic behind suppressing that fully [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3277.48s)]
*  I don't see the capacity to suppress it fully who knows what I don't know [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3280.92s)]
*  But my guess is if you had [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3286.2000000000003s)]
*  Actual craft moving around in the ways that people who have observed these things think they've seen it [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3289.1600000000003s)]
*  that [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3295.52s)]
*  Noise would be an inherent part of the phenomenon [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3296.48s)]
*  And why would that be the case if it operates on a gravity? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3299.2000000000003s)]
*  Propulsion system that essentially bends space around it and instead of creating a sonic boom because it's flying through the air [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3302.52s)]
*  It's not flying through the air. It's displacing space [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3309.0s)]
*  Well, I don't even know displacing space means I don't know what a gravity propulsion system means, right? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3312.64s)]
*  So but I'm trying to imagine some futuristic sci-fi version of a propulsion system that doesn't involve [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3318.7999999999997s)]
*  Pushing something out the back. It doesn't involve exhaust. Oh, like I'm not rocket [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3325.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm not necessarily [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3331.08s)]
*  requiring engine noise [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3332.64s)]
*  I'm requiring air noise passing through the air [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3334.84s)]
*  Yeah passing through the air noise that you know as the air collapses as the craft moves [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3338.04s)]
*  The air collapses behind it that you'd hear something you mean when it's moving fast [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3344.66s)]
*  Yes, especially if it's moving fast [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3349.56s)]
*  But if it's not really displacing the air around it and if this is what allows it to go through the water as well [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3351.56s)]
*  With extreme speed so one of the crazier things that they've they've monitored is something moving underwater [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3358.52s)]
*  That's huge like size of a couple football fields at 500 knots. So this this is exactly my problem is [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3364.84s)]
*  There's two realms there's a realm in which I understand [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3372.64s)]
*  The physics of the universe enough that I can evaluate that claim and then I can say well [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3378.28s)]
*  It's not obvious to me how you go through the water the water has to be displaced and [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3384.64s)]
*  water is [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3391.9599999999996s)]
*  Denser than air in terms of how much matter there is how many particles there are and therefore [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3393.9599999999996s)]
*  It ought to be harder to move through than air. I would expect noise in the air [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3399.8799999999997s)]
*  I would expect something similar in the water and the fact that these things [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3403.9599999999996s)]
*  And the fact that these things [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3408.28s)]
*  Behave in a couple of different ways one. They're silent two they turn in ways that [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3410.28s)]
*  Would challenge a biological critter profoundly three they move at speeds that are [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3417.1600000000003s)]
*  Improbable in light of what we understand now [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3426.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm not saying there can't be lots of stuff we don't understand but what I'm saying is all of those things [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3429.1200000000003s)]
*  Have a simplest explanation which is that that craft isn't matter [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3434.32s)]
*  All right, it's it's a projection now what science [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3440.96s)]
*  What kind of technology would even be available that could create a projection like that? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3446.1200000000003s)]
*  Well that I believe we have I'm not expert in it, but you can project from above or below [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3451.6400000000003s)]
*  Onto material, you know, okay could even I think be done in clear skies, right? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3458.08s)]
*  Especially if you had a substrate and I don't I don't know whether to go down this road. Let's go down that road [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3464.8399999999997s)]
*  What do you mean? Well [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3470.8399999999997s)]
*  there seems to be a certain amount of experimentation with [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3473.08s)]
*  particles being [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3477.3199999999997s)]
*  Released from aircraft for some reason I would assume and have long assumed that there is experimentation with [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3479.12s)]
*  Altering the albedo of the earth so it reflects more light back into space. Well, there's certainly proposals [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3486.44s)]
*  It's certainly been discussed and you know, this is something that Bill Gates has been involved in [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3492.28s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't think you know one of the things that we many of us came to understand during kovat about [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3497.4s)]
*  Proposals is the very often the proposal comes after the experiments have already begun [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3503.68s)]
*  right you propose an experiment that you've already done and then right recoup your your [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3508.48s)]
*  Investment when the grant is given so anyway, I believe that there's been some experimentation with [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3514.2400000000002s)]
*  Releasing particles. I think it's an insane experiment to run its diabolical [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3521.0s)]
*  Frankly, you have no right to alter the earth's atmosphere without us at least having a global public discussion about the consequences [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3524.92s)]
*  I believe this is an informed consent violation and that I take those things very seriously [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3532.28s)]
*  Those were hanging offenses in at the end of World War two [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3538.0s)]
*  But nonetheless if you drop particles into the atmosphere those particles are largely not visible [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3541.56s)]
*  right, they have impacts but could they be used to project a [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3548.6s)]
*  Craft that that wasn't on to a substrate. You can't quite see so it would have to be a substrate [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3554.12s)]
*  So would there have to be particles or is it is there a potential? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3560.72s)]
*  Technology that would allow you to project something into the just actual air clear blue sky [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3564.56s)]
*  Physical thing something that looks like a physical thing. Well, let's put it this way [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3571.88s)]
*  First of all, there are always particles even if what we're talking about is air [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3575.4s)]
*  Navy laser creates plasma UFOs [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3580.2799999999997s)]
*  At least four years old remember I showed you that one YouTube video that one time that shows there's little plasma things dancing in the air [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3583.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah find that find that video. Yeah, that's almost describes that it's they've created stuff to [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3590.08s)]
*  trick missiles and different homing [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3596.2799999999997s)]
*  Devices not that that's what this is but it's a potential explanation for what some of it it's in the right neighborhood [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3599.12s)]
*  so let's just say first of all, this is where I would want a [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3607.08s)]
*  Robust university system and a robust journalistic system to dig [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3612.76s)]
*  because [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3618.7200000000003s)]
*  There's a lot you need to know [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3619.96s)]
*  That you could figure out that would tell us whether or not what we're looking at are really distant craft moves it moving at [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3622.52s)]
*  Tremendous speeds or it's an optical illusion for let me just give you an example. You'll you'll probably have this is ten years old [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3629.44s)]
*  Huh and they could do it in patterns like this in the air [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3637.76s)]
*  Look what they could do a long time ago aliens [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3641.04s)]
*  So they're making a butterfly out of plasma bulbs in the air [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3643.4s)]
*  Huh a plasma pretty good [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3648.8s)]
*  And pretty silent what oh [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3652.08s)]
*  My god, that's pretty good. That's insane. Oh my god now make a tick-tack [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3655.64s)]
*  So a 3d display in midair using laser laser plasma technology [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3660.2400000000002s)]
*  So if you were somewhere and you encountered these things you would absolutely think these are alien craft from another dimension [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3665.68s)]
*  That's come here to communicate with you and imagine that you saw that [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3672.96s)]
*  outside [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3678.12s)]
*  Right, you wouldn't necessarily know how far away the object was and therefore you wouldn't necessarily know how fast it was moving [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3679.44s)]
*  You'd you'd misjudge it and to give it everybody an example that they will have familiar familiarity with I was driving down the highway at one point [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3686.18s)]
*  Rainstorm but the Sun was shining and I saw a rainbow and I've thought a lot about rainbows [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3694.52s)]
*  They're pretty interesting and I realized that I could tell that although the rainbow [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3701.2200000000003s)]
*  looked to be [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3706.48s)]
*  10 miles from me or something like that [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3708.16s)]
*  It was actually feet from me and I could tell that because the rainbow [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3710.72s)]
*  Came down onto the road and I could see it in front of the guardrail [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3716.64s)]
*  Right continuous rainbow where the parts up here look like they're closer to the mountains in the distance [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3722.7599999999998s)]
*  But when I see where it's continued down into the spray off the road, it's actually 10 feet away, right? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3728.3599999999997s)]
*  So the mind is [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3735.1200000000003s)]
*  Building a model of stuff and if you give it the wrong cues [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3736.88s)]
*  It'll totally misunderstand the distance that it's looking at. I mean to the extent that a rainbow is at a distance, right? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3741.1600000000003s)]
*  Right, especially when you take any consideration a lot of these UFOs are in night skies [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3748.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, right. Let's say it's all black sky or trying it's very difficult to gauge [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3753.2400000000002s)]
*  So if you had if you had a robust journalistic [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3758.6400000000003s)]
*  Apparatus what it would want to do is figure out well if person a was standing in location X and they saw craft [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3763.1600000000003s)]
*  Moving at what appeared to be 200 miles an hour [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3771.6400000000003s)]
*  At a distance of five miles [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3775.28s)]
*  Then the question is well who else would have seen it and if we go and we ask people who were standing in those locations [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3777.6400000000003s)]
*  Did they see it at all? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3784.44s)]
*  Because if they didn't then maybe the thing was inches away from the person being projected [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3785.8s)]
*  locally [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3790.96s)]
*  Right, and they only felt like they saw something at a great distance. Mm-hmm [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3792.16s)]
*  so [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3796.64s)]
*  What is your take when you keep hearing all these congressional whistleblowers and people coming and talking about that? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3797.8399999999997s)]
*  We've been in contact and we have in our possession [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3805.08s)]
*  Multiple craft that are not of this world. What's all that? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3809.12s)]
*  Well, I'm going to share credit with Ben Davidson for this [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3814.0s)]
*  But the basic point is Psyop until proven otherwise [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3818.88s)]
*  and Psyop until proven otherwise, I think is a very functional way to approach this because [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3822.52s)]
*  Depending upon what kind of program we're looking at and there obviously is [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3831.36s)]
*  Governmental involvement in whatever it is either concealing real stuff or pretending that it has real stuff that it's pretending to conceal or whatever [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3835.28s)]
*  It's doing right [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3842.76s)]
*  there is [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3844.6400000000003s)]
*  Every possibility that [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3847.6s)]
*  There are sort of layers of awareness and [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3851.68s)]
*  At the bottom layer there may not be anything alien at all [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3858.64s)]
*  But it may be that people fairly close to the center have been shown something [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3862.96s)]
*  I mean [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3868.6s)]
*  I don't understand what the purpose of any of this stuff is either [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3869.72s)]
*  Talk to us about the aliens and when they started to visit and what it is [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3872.28s)]
*  They seem to want and whether they're still here and whether they're gonna be back and whatever we know. That's what I would do [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3876.16s)]
*  Any excuse that says the public can't handle it. I think it's just nonsense [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3883.64s)]
*  But isn't the problem if you've been let's pretend that there is a real crash retrieval program and there are real aliens [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3889.28s)]
*  If we've been hiding it for so long then it's very difficult to not hide it anymore [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3897.6400000000003s)]
*  It's almost like kind of like being in the closet like even though there's no reason to be in the closet in 2025 [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3902.84s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are still in the closet [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3908.28s)]
*  Yeah [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3909.76s)]
*  And I think part of the reason why they're in the closet is because like they were in the closet 20 years ago and they've been [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3910.2400000000002s)]
*  Lying forever and they don't want to come out. So that's just a person with social consequences now imagine a government [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3914.84s)]
*  So, how are you funding these things were you lying to Congress you have a crash retrieval program? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3923.6s)]
*  How is that funded like let me see your budget. Let me see where where did you allocate the money? This is fraud [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3928.68s)]
*  Okay. Now you're getting into a situation where people can go to jail [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3934.68s)]
*  There's perjury these people that have lied on the witness stand [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3937.36s)]
*  So like if that's the case, then I understand why you would continue for your own personal benefit just for your own personal protection [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3940.92s)]
*  Your own personal interest to keep things secret from the American people [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3947.98s)]
*  Then there's also the attitude that government does have there's the [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3952.08s)]
*  Infantilization of our people by the government that's always been like they they decide that [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3957.3599999999997s)]
*  Malinformation is a thing. So what that is is information that's true, but it could fuck you up [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3964.2s)]
*  So we're gonna say it's bad. It's bad information, even though it's accurate information [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3970.2s)]
*  So this is like you're a baby. You can't handle the truth [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3975.7599999999998s)]
*  That's basically what that is is the government's version of it now that sort of attitude which clearly persists throughout the entire federal government [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3979.8s)]
*  Wouldn't you apply that sort of thinking to something as powerful as an actual alien? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3987.7200000000003s)]
*  Contact that we have been experiencing for decades and they've been lying about all right [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=3994.5600000000004s)]
*  Well as long as we're just sort of fantasizing about wild stuff here [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4000.26s)]
*  Imagine that Donald Trump were to be elected president for a second time and he was pissed off and he was to nominate [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4003.5s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard for the director of National Intelligence and then she was only [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4010.8599999999997s)]
*  Hours or at most days away from being confirmed by the Senate then when she gets in [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4017.3399999999997s)]
*  Presumably she wouldn't have investment in all of those years of lying about this and she might feel obligated [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4024.62s)]
*  To tell us in the public what the hell's going on. Maybe we should add that part out so she gets confirmed [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4030.62s)]
*  Yeah [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4035.9s)]
*  All right fair enough just kidding just kidding we don't have to edit it out but yeah, that's the hope right the hope is [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4038.58s)]
*  She's a very honest person and a real patriot and she would want people to know hundred percent also [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4045.66s)]
*  You know, we've got Elon on a separate track [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4049.62s)]
*  he's going through the books and finding all of the [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4052.62s)]
*  the nonsense and so presumably the [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4056.42s)]
*  effort to hide whatever it is either to manufacture the impression of [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4060.1s)]
*  UFOs or to hide what we know about them. That's gonna have a budget somewhere. Yeah [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4064.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's all interesting [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4071.22s)]
*  but it's also I always assume that when something hits the zeitgeist and is like [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4074.62s)]
*  prominently out in the newspapers and media and websites and I always assume that they're covering something else and that this thing is [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4079.74s)]
*  The big distraction and that's what I was thinking while the UFO thing was happening over New Jersey [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4087.46s)]
*  I was like, okay, what are they distracting from? What's the big distraction? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4093.18s)]
*  Because it seems like that's what that was that just seemed so forced and so obvious and then the Trump administration says oh [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4097.54s)]
*  They were ours [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4104.9s)]
*  Right. Well, okay. Well, why were you doing that? Why were they doing that? Why why didn't they say they were ours? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4106.7s)]
*  Why did they freak everybody out? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4112.66s)]
*  Why they send jets to go scramble after them and then they turn their lights off and disappear like what so there there is the [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4114.5s)]
*  Question of what they were trying to distract us from if that was their purpose, but I also find this is again [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4120.78s)]
*  Become a kind of theme in my life [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4128.46s)]
*  This is also a violation of informed consent if those were our drones and they were [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4130.5s)]
*  Nightly traumatizing the residents of New Jersey and pretending they didn't know what it was [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4137.06s)]
*  That's a de facto experiment that they were running on the citizens of the country they have no right to do this shit [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4142.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, that should be illegal 100% [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4149.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, especially like lying about it and not telling us what you're doing [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4153.22s)]
*  and then just keeping everybody in the dark for weeks or people were really panicking I [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4157.02s)]
*  I [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4161.9400000000005s)]
*  You know one doesn't know until you see this stuff [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4163.780000000001s)]
*  In acted [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4167.42s)]
*  Where it's gonna lead but my sense is I don't want my government lying to me ever again [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4169.54s)]
*  With the excuse that it's for my own good. Is it possible to you know Obama passed that? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4176.780000000001s)]
*  Law in was it 2012 that allowed the government to use propaganda on its own citizens [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4185.14s)]
*  That law I'm trying to remember this is not the NDAA 2012 no no NDAA is a that's the [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4192.82s)]
*  Authorization act that this is a that's indefinite detention. Yeah, that's indefinite detention. This is different [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4200.66s)]
*  This is the use of propaganda [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4205.86s)]
*  So they authorize the use of propaganda on American citizens [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4209.0599999999995s)]
*  So the CIA instead of turning its you know propaganda wing on the whole world [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4212.42s)]
*  They're allowed to use it under the guise of course of national defense national security [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4216.9s)]
*  Sometimes they need to bullshit us. Well, that is in fact exactly what we have discovered [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4222.98s)]
*  Yeah, and why it was so hard to convince people of this before the evidence for it emerged [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4227.54s)]
*  I don't know but all you needed to realize was that some rogue element [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4234.78s)]
*  Had decided that it had the right to engage in the same kind of regime change bullshit [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4241.98s)]
*  domestically that it was [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4249.7s)]
*  Already feeling entitled to engage in globally and the rest makes perfect sense [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4252.0599999999995s)]
*  And of course you would get an entrenched cabal that would come up with a justification [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4257.139999999999s)]
*  For fending off a challenge, you know at the ballot box that it could portray as somehow [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4261.58s)]
*  A threat to American democracy, of course, it would do that [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4268.58s)]
*  Yeah, right [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4272.38s)]
*  It has to be forbidden to do that and the penalties have to be extreme for attempting it or it will happen [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4272.98s)]
*  Right. But so the argument against that is not not the argument for using it in America [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4279.66s)]
*  But the argument is you need organizations like that to do that worldwide to counteract the fact that other [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4285.54s)]
*  countries are doing that worldwide and that there is some sort of a [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4291.0199999999995s)]
*  Psychological game that's going on as a propaganda game that's going on with all countries as well as [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4295.700000000001s)]
*  You know, they're doing it against us. We're doing it against them [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4302.900000000001s)]
*  We need to be sophisticated in how we employ these things. Otherwise, we're gonna lose very important parts of the world [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4306.54s)]
*  Key to the national security of the United States [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4313.38s)]
*  We have to have things like that in place [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4315.58s)]
*  But when they start using it on us and they say oh well [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4318.02s)]
*  We have to start using it on us because Russia's using it on us [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4321.7s)]
*  But we have to use it on us to counteract what China's doing. We have to that's when things get really screwy, right? Well [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4324.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes, but I also am not sure that I buy the international [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4331.42s)]
*  Rationale either and I think as much as I understand it, right? [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4335.66s)]
*  We have to be mature about what's possible in the world and what implications it has for [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4340.5s)]
*  for the Republic on [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4347.38s)]
*  The other hand to the extent that we believe in self-determination [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4349.3s)]
*  Where exactly does our right to interfere with other people's self-determination come from? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4356.02s)]
*  further I do think that there's a kind of end state for [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4362.1s)]
*  the governance structures of earth that [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4367.58s)]
*  what we have in the West an [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4371.38s)]
*  agreement on a level playing field an agreement to [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4374.46s)]
*  compete with each other by [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4378.379999999999s)]
*  Attempting to produce better stuff rather than by interfering with our competitors ability to get to the market [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4381.299999999999s)]
*  that [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4389.58s)]
*  That view of the West is superior and it is also contagious [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4390.7s)]
*  That it makes for a safer [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4397.86s)]
*  more rewarding fairer [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4401.78s)]
*  Less warlike system and [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4404.58s)]
*  Therefore there's a very good reason for people to want to adopt it [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4408.900000000001s)]
*  So that sounds great though [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4412.34s)]
*  but doesn't that isn't that slightly naive when you take into consideration the amount of [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4413.66s)]
*  Espionage that we know exists in American corporations and in American [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4419.42s)]
*  Educational institutions. Well, I'm not arguing that you just go and live your values [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4424.9800000000005s)]
*  What I'm arguing is that those values are superior that they are sticky and contagious [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4432.02s)]
*  When they take hold and that anything you do where you compromise on the idea that that's the objective is to get [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4438.34s)]
*  Western values to to catch on across the world, right? Anytime you decide you have a right to do something else [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4446.9400000000005s)]
*  You're you're you're dragging us on to a slippery slope [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4453.780000000001s)]
*  Okay, you will disrupt other people's self-determination you have no basic right to do it and it will eventually come home and be done [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4457.58s)]
*  to us [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4464.94s)]
*  mmm, so I [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4465.74s)]
*  Don't know what the sophisticated way to make it maximally likely that other societies take on those values is but I know that it was [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4468.219999999999s)]
*  happening organically without us having to do terribly much and so the real question is [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4475.9s)]
*  how do we make that a [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4482.099999999999s)]
*  Winner so that it organically catches on and how do we? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4484.900000000001s)]
*  Reinforce it when it does how much are you paying attention to deep seek and the AI competition that's going on right now [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4490.7s)]
*  I am loosely paying attention to the AI competition. I'm conflicted about it [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4497.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't think there's anything we can do to regulate AI competition that doesn't make matters worse [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4503.18s)]
*  I'm very concerned about the [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4509.08s)]
*  Outgrowth of [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4512.66s)]
*  This transformative technology, I think even the most mundane disruptions that will come from it things like [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4514.7s)]
*  disruptions to the the job market are [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4523.7s)]
*  Going to be a profound challenge to our society and we're going to have to come up with an [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4527.26s)]
*  approach that allows us [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4533.86s)]
*  To tolerate the disruption. I used to think the approach was universal basic income [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4536.0199999999995s)]
*  But now I'm conflicted because now I just take into account human nature [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4540.8s)]
*  And you know, unfortunately, I don't think it's good for people to just give them free money [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4546.200000000001s)]
*  Even though you need to even though you need to I think is it's ultimately bad for them to be dependent upon it [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4550.6s)]
*  and that's what scares me about automation and AI in general that if it does get to the point where [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4556.160000000001s)]
*  there's so many people that are displaced from the job market that we have to provide them like a real meaningful wage and [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4562.360000000001s)]
*  What incentives do they have to break free from that system and do they just decide to live inside the means of whatever? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4568.639999999999s)]
*  That is forever and does that limit the growth and potential that those people possess because people really don't accomplish anything [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4576.48s)]
*  Unless they're driven or unless they have to right? That's that's what really gets people going [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4584.24s)]
*  That's why it's so difficult for people that were trust fund babies to ever get anything going [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4588.759999999999s)]
*  I mean [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4592.639999999999s)]
*  We all know the trust fund kids that are just they do do drugs and party and they're materialists and they're really lost [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4593.28s)]
*  That's really common like more common than not right very difficult [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4600.08s)]
*  To navigate that water [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4605.8s)]
*  So what what would we do to incentivize people to do things? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4608.04s)]
*  Like to have this healthy thriving [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4614.0s)]
*  artistic creative [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4618.36s)]
*  Innovative economy that we have right now like how does that continue if so many people are displaced from the job market or [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4620.12s)]
*  Is there a way where you can say you know what we are so concerned about basic? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4627.72s)]
*  Goods needs food shelter things like if you just provide people with the basics [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4634.24s)]
*  So nobody ever has to worry about food or shelter [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4640.2s)]
*  Would it organically arise that some people would compete outside of that and then say now that I have basic food and shelter [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4643.5199999999995s)]
*  Let me pursue my dreams. Let me do what I want to do. Let me provide [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4650.88s)]
*  Let me create a business that AI can't make let me make you know fine cabinetry [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4655.48s)]
*  Let me let me do let me paint let me do things that's gonna provide a real value [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4660.5199999999995s)]
*  that you know, I can get money from that it can be an actual viable business and [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4666.0s)]
*  Maybe the way to incentivize people do that is to never take away their universal basic income [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4672.72s)]
*  So it's not like welfare where one of things like my family was on welfare when we were young and when they got off welfare [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4677.360000000001s)]
*  it was like a nice thing to know that like [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4683.92s)]
*  We're providing for ourselves now, you know, but you have to do that [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4687.360000000001s)]
*  You have to break off the system and then you don't get the checks anymore [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4691.820000000001s)]
*  but what if the people just keep getting universal basic income and you'll and we just [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4695.0s)]
*  Rewire the way we think about food and shelter we think about food and shelter is just something that everybody should have [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4700.4800000000005s)]
*  Not like tons of money not an exposable indispensable income where you can disposable income [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4706.200000000001s)]
*  We could just buy fucking junk food and garbage and and do cocaine all day [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4712.0s)]
*  But have enough where you can live and then have people [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4716.400000000001s)]
*  Pursue a life that is more meaningful, but you have to give people incentives [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4721.84s)]
*  They have to be somehow or another either personally motivated to do that [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4726.4s)]
*  Encouraged by the culture to do that. It has to be something where people develop this desire to do more [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4732.48s)]
*  well, let's talk about the [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4740.2s)]
*  ultimate source of this problem [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4743.5199999999995s)]
*  our ancestors our hunter-gatherer ancestors even our farming ancestors lived in a world where [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4745.96s)]
*  The world itself provided the incentive structure [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4753.0s)]
*  Right if you didn't work hard enough as a hunter-gatherer it manifested as hunger and jeopardy [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4757.84s)]
*  So people were naturally incentivized to invest in the right kind of stuff and the right kind of stuff is hard work in some cases [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4765.84s)]
*  Where you know you pursue the materials that make your hut better that procure more food for your family [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4773.240000000001s)]
*  Or it could be insight where you figure out some way to do something better [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4780.32s)]
*  So you make more with what you've already figured out how to get [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4785.12s)]
*  That's a very natural structure and it's what we neurologically are built for [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4790.0s)]
*  The economy has some of that [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4796.28s)]
*  characteristic the economy rewards hard work somewhat and [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4800.4800000000005s)]
*  It also rewards cheating and it rewards lots of [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4805.72s)]
*  Unproductive behavior that actually destroys wealth but creates a profit [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4812.6s)]
*  Yeah, for example, it rewards gambling it rewards [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4817.4800000000005s)]
*  Interference competition all sorts of stuff, you know destroying wealth is actually a big part of our economy and the way [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4823.12s)]
*  The mythology of [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4830.32s)]
*  Free market capitalism works you're getting paid for producing stuff that enhances us all [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4832.84s)]
*  But what fraction of the economy is actually dedicated to activities that destroy wealth? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4839.2s)]
*  You know the production of porn for example in my opinion that is highly likely to destroy vastly more wealth than it than it produces [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4845.32s)]
*  In my opinion that is highly likely to destroy vastly more wealth than it than it produces [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4854.52s)]
*  But it's a very rich industry for a reason so [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4861.24s)]
*  What I'm getting at is we have a new problem with the AI component [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4866.4s)]
*  Maybe it's taken the magnitude of the problem that we had and it's multiplied it by 10 [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4872.44s)]
*  But it's not a new problem [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4879.28s)]
*  We are still trying to figure out what to do with the fact that you're taking an animal out of the habitat that properly [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4880.76s)]
*  inherently incentivizes it and putting it into an environment in which the incentives aren't really well built and I agree with you whatever [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4887.12s)]
*  Sympathy I may have had for the idea of universal basic income is gone because I do think it would produce at best a [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4895.6s)]
*  Kind of learned helplessness. Yes, that's unproductive [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4904.0s)]
*  dependency [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4908.68s)]
*  So what scary right? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4909.68s)]
*  So what we really want is a system in which whatever the new opportunities are going to be in the world where AI is available [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4911.16s)]
*  Everywhere and very sophisticated [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4920.200000000001s)]
*  we want people to figure out how to leverage it on our behalf and [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4923.200000000001s)]
*  Mind you we could have the same conversation [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4928.76s)]
*  Before the World Wide Web and we could talk about well [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4931.52s)]
*  What's it gonna be like when you can source information [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4934.64s)]
*  Right from anywhere. What kinds of opportunities is that going to create and can we incentivize people to figure out what those opportunities are? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4938.160000000001s)]
*  Yada, yada, yada. So the AI version is this it's the same problem, but at a different order of magnitude [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4946.280000000001s)]
*  So I don't know what the solution is about how you create that proper incentive structure, but [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4954.320000000001s)]
*  We are going to be living in a world in which [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4961.28s)]
*  meaning and wealth are of a fundamentally different nature and [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4964.48s)]
*  what we want is for people to have the tools and [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4969.48s)]
*  the incentive to explore that world [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4975.48s)]
*  Productively so that when they do it well, they end up [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4980.24s)]
*  Economically enhanced and when they do it poorly they suffer a challenge so that they are [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4985.68s)]
*  Naturally led by that world to find stuff that creates wealth for all of us, right? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4992.4400000000005s)]
*  That maybe it starts with the education system. Maybe we have to incentivize people to pursue their dreams instead of just to try to find a job [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=4998.84s)]
*  Because that this is the way the education system is scheduled now or is is set up now [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5005.64s)]
*  It's basically you go back to the Rockefellers, right? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5012.08s)]
*  This is you're basically trying to make factory workers. You're trying to make people that obey the earlier [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5014.719999999999s)]
*  You can get them into school the better because the more you can indoctrinate them into the way the system works [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5019.04s)]
*  You get them accustomed you get these kids that are filled with fucking energy and they're excited about the world [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5023.2s)]
*  They just want to play all the time and you make them just sit down all day [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5029.12s)]
*  And when they don't you say that little fellas got ADD. He's not paying attention [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5032.4s)]
*  We need to give him some Ritalin the little fuckers just sitting there jacked out of his mind on Ritalin now [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5036.639999999999s)]
*  You know and this is what we've done and instead of having an education system that educates people that way have an education [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5041.44s)]
*  System that excites people about learning things are actually interested in hell. Yeah, but again [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5049.04s)]
*  this is an another version where it's not like AI is a [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5055.5599999999995s)]
*  Bad fit for the education system it certainly is but the education system has been garbage [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5063.12s)]
*  My whole life existed with an education system that was almost totally worthless and in some cases was counterproductive [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5071.2s)]
*  Which is I think why some of us folks with learning disabilities actually turn out to have an advantage [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5077.7s)]
*  It's not that there's something good about having a learning disability [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5083.12s)]
*  But if it breaks your relationship to school so school has less of an easy time programming you to be a cog [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5086.76s)]
*  Yeah, you at least retain the potential to be something other than a cog. I don't think I had a learning disability [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5092.5599999999995s)]
*  but I was a [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5098.599999999999s)]
*  Latchkey kid right so I didn't have a lot of guidance when I was young and I wasn't used to people telling me what to [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5100.48s)]
*  do and I didn't enjoy it and [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5105.92s)]
*  Also, I had a lot of energy and it was very difficult for me to pay attention to boring things by uninspired teachers [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5108.32s)]
*  But then again every now and then I'd have an inspired teacher and I'd go okay [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5116.2s)]
*  Maybe I'm not stupid like maybe I'm just bored [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5119.9s)]
*  You know and I'd get really interested in something and then I'd learn a lot about it [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5122.84s)]
*  And then I'd be able to like tell people about it to talk to my friends [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5126.3s)]
*  You know what I learned today, and we'd have these conversations about it like okay [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5129.58s)]
*  It's not that I'm not curious or interested is that I'm not being inspired [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5132.46s)]
*  Now why is that is it because I'm 10 you know and you know this is hard to be inspired by things you attend [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5137.02s)]
*  Because you're just a little fucking dork and you're running around [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5143.38s)]
*  Reading comic books and paying attention to other things and you don't really care about math or you don't care about history [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5146.3s)]
*  What is it but whatever it is the system's not working for you you have to find some sort of inspiration [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5152.799999999999s)]
*  Outside of it, and I've been educated almost entirely outside of schools almost all of what I know [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5160.08s)]
*  I know from books that I've read because I was interested or I listen to audiobooks or listen to podcasts or had conversations with people [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5166.36s)]
*  Like you that's how I learned things [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5172.66s)]
*  And it wasn't that I wasn't interested. It wasn't that I wasn't smart. It was that I was not inspired [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5175.28s)]
*  I [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5180.8s)]
*  Had other I didn't know that I wasn't a loser until I got really good at other things and like I can get good at things [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5181.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay, so if I can get good at things, it's not that I'm a loser [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5188.08s)]
*  She's like I can't work a job [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5190.12s)]
*  I can't just show up every day and do something that's not exciting to me, but it doesn't mean I'm useless [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5192.240000000001s)]
*  It just means I'm useless for that. I don't have the personality to just sit there and go over paperwork [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5198.08s)]
*  It doesn't I can't I'll go crazy [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5203.320000000001s)]
*  But that go crazy part is also what lets you have the courage or the [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5205.92s)]
*  the motivation to go and try a path that seems unlikely for success and [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5212.08s)]
*  To have the courage to say well some people succeed [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5218.4s)]
*  I fucking try it and just I can't do this fuck it [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5220.82s)]
*  Let's give it a go and then that's how you become a stand-up comedian, you know [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5224.4s)]
*  Nobody thinks nobody thinks it's a good path like out of a hundred stand-up comedians that do open mic night [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5228.32s)]
*  Maybe one maybe one will have some sort of a career in comedy [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5234.48s)]
*  well, I'm really glad you're telling me this because [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5240.48s)]
*  Back when I was a college professor before 2017 I [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5244.2s)]
*  Used to be since I was a terrible student myself [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5248.639999999999s)]
*  I was fascinated by the students who had really high potential but were just not a good fit for school [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5251.04s)]
*  So I was really interested in what made people smart [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5257.259999999999s)]
*  Especially when it had nothing to do with school or happened in spite of school and your story fits perfectly here [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5260.599999999999s)]
*  In fact what you describe is sort of the equivalent of a learning disability [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5266.04s)]
*  right like suspicion that your teachers aren't all that and [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5272.44s)]
*  Maybe you're not so thrilled at sitting there listening to them, you know [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5276.08s)]
*  Occasionally it sounds like you had a teacher who was pretty good. Yes. Thank God me too. I had about one in five [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5279.4s)]
*  Yeah teachers. That's good. That's a great number wasn't terrible [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5285.36s)]
*  But for the rest of the time, you know school was so busy [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5289.38s)]
*  Dismissing me as you know not performing to potential was what it said every [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5293.6s)]
*  every time on my report card, right that it was just really demoralizing and I [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5299.46s)]
*  Remember sort of in the second grade [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5305.780000000001s)]
*  Having a kind of choice I didn't know what it was that I was choosing between but it was like I can either surrender [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5309.860000000001s)]
*  To their understanding of who I am or I can stop respecting them and [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5315.900000000001s)]
*  So it created an attitude problem. Sounds like you had a similar attitude problem and [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5320.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I wish I could give every student that attitude problem the thing the difference is when I was 13 years old [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5328.02s)]
*  I didn't have the internet and the kids today that are 13 years old they can get inspired by so many different things [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5334.9800000000005s)]
*  They'll go and find a YouTube video on ancient civilizations [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5341.06s)]
*  then also they're inspired and they want to learn about this and that and [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5343.9400000000005s)]
*  There's so many different things that can fire you up [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5346.9800000000005s)]
*  Intellectually that are outside of the school system or back then it was just a school system and occasionally books [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5350.46s)]
*  You know someone would recommend books, but there was no documentaries that people could just rent. There was it wasn't there wasn't the kind of [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5356.46s)]
*  access to [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5365.22s)]
*  Simulating ideas that is available today, which I think is like [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5366.84s)]
*  Unprecedented the amount of access to interesting ideas that people have today is off the charts [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5371.08s)]
*  It's never in human history been anything remotely close. But along with that you have flat earth and [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5377.2s)]
*  All across deniers. You look at everything. It's all piled in together. You have so much nonsense. It's all together [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5383.6s)]
*  Yeah, but you also you know, I'm skeptical that the [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5390.28s)]
*  vast wealth of [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5394.4800000000005s)]
*  Information is inherently a good thing really. Yeah, because I know [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5397.4400000000005s)]
*  Like I said, I became very interested in what made people smart and what made people smart was not [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5403.88s)]
*  libraries [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5411.4800000000005s)]
*  What made people smart was an interaction with the world that rewarded them when they figured something out and very often [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5413.08s)]
*  That was the physical world [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5420.96s)]
*  So one of the things I worry about with you know [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5421.96s)]
*  a kid who maybe is not getting so much out of school but they have access to an entire world of fascinating things on their [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5424.9s)]
*  Computer is that it turns all of that stuff into an exercise in consuming information [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5431.34s)]
*  rather than discovering and [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5438.36s)]
*  So I would much rather see [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5441.52s)]
*  kids have access to a [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5445.68s)]
*  You know a wild world a forest that's intact where they can [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5448.68s)]
*  Go and discover things and those things aren't labeled and you don't know what it is and you don't know what it means or [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5456.12s)]
*  You know you try to build a structure a treehouse or something and it tests your understanding of what the structure is [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5462.36s)]
*  you know that will hold you and [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5469.64s)]
*  That it is that feedback where you are not a consumer of the world but you are a producer you're [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5472.56s)]
*  interacting with the world rather than just seeing it represented that is the most [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5479.240000000001s)]
*  Intellectually enhancing thing are they mutually exclusive though? No, it seems like it would be beneficial for people to have both [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5484.4800000000005s)]
*  It seems like especially young people would be beneficial for them to have the natural world, which I think you're absolutely right [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5492.160000000001s)]
*  It's very important and just to be you know, hopefully safely be wild and outside or not [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5498.24s)]
*  I mean, that's unsafe enough that you develop sense. Yeah [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5504.2s)]
*  Yeah, but yes, I think it ideally you would have access to both so it would create the [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5510.599999999999s)]
*  The reward patterns in your mind that would cause you to think about how to be productive in the world [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5517.0s)]
*  but I also think that the way the [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5522.4s)]
*  Online world presents itself is strangely [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5525.8s)]
*  Demotivating right because you know you see [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5530.68s)]
*  Whatever social media platform you're on you've got some 30 second clip of some person [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5535.2s)]
*  Doing some utterly remarkable thing that I would have said until I saw it with my own eyes was impossible [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5541.92s)]
*  that doesn't create a [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5549.8s)]
*  pathway to discovering [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5552.24s)]
*  What the person in question can do what you're looking at is somebody whose abilities outstrips what almost anybody could give an example [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5555.0s)]
*  Okay, so this is you know something I saw yesterday [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5563.56s)]
*  guys [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5568.12s)]
*  riding down a ramp and [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5569.76s)]
*  launching themselves [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5573.68s)]
*  two or three stories into the air on a scooter and then [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5575.4800000000005s)]
*  Turning around and dropping back onto the same [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5582.0s)]
*  ramp [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5586.759999999999s)]
*  You know and of course, I think I saw Red Bull in there somewhere, right? [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5587.919999999999s)]
*  So it's like first of all, you've got this corporation incentivizing people to take risks that aren't smart [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5591.799999999999s)]
*  right and then you've got an apparatus that you're not going to be able to build or approximate and [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5597.2s)]
*  Then you've got the person who leverages the apparatus better than anybody and it's like well [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5602.28s)]
*  Where's the opportunity for the viewer to be like? Yeah, I want to I want to get in on that [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5607.12s)]
*  Well, it inspires them to go somewhere and find out how you do that, right? [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5611.639999999999s)]
*  That's like a Chuck Norris movie inspires you to take a karate class. Well, I think a Chuck Norris movie is probably a better [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5617.679999999999s)]
*  tool [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5625.16s)]
*  The [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5627.5599999999995s)]
*  The admixture of people who are highly capable and people who get some of the thrill of the highly capable [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5631.2s)]
*  Person just by viewing it is not as good as it might be [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5639.599999999999s)]
*  right in other words, I [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5644.32s)]
*  think we've taken all [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5646.639999999999s)]
*  Sorts of activities that people used to engage in and we've found a consumable [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5649.44s)]
*  Equivalent right like sport people used to play sports now most people who are into sports [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5656.4s)]
*  Watch sports they're consuming the sport rather than participating in it, right? Especially adults [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5664.759999999999s)]
*  especially adults likewise sex frankly [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5672.24s)]
*  sex is a very [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5676.44s)]
*  important realm and [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5679.32s)]
*  It is it's a skill the skill involves insight into your partner and we've turned it into a [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5681.4s)]
*  consumable where you can [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5689.5199999999995s)]
*  Chase your fetish or whatever and just watch it on a screen [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5691.56s)]
*  Right and the point is that's actually not the same activity, right? And that's also [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5695.88s)]
*  Leading to this weird world. We're living now. We're a giant percentage of especially young men aren't having any sex, right? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5702.240000000001s)]
*  That's where it goes and right, you know if we take ourselves back, you know a couple hundred years [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5709.96s)]
*  Music music used to be something that people did [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5717.12s)]
*  Everybody sung and they whistled and many people played musical instruments now music is a consumable [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5721.28s)]
*  And the point is [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5728.84s)]
*  the reward [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5731.0s)]
*  May be somewhat similar to [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5732.76s)]
*  Listening to a really good song as it is to play a really good song on an instrument [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5735.2s)]
*  but the degree to which you've been robbed as a human being who is capable of producing music and you just [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5739.8s)]
*  You don't have a thought of doing it because there's so much to listen to that's not positive for humans. All right [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5744.4s)]
*  I see what you're saying [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5750.32s)]
*  Yeah [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5752.36s)]
*  but isn't that like [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5753.639999999999s)]
*  At least people are being exposed to a bunch of different ideas [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5755.5599999999995s)]
*  So it has the potential to lead them to try and do different things [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5759.48s)]
*  Well, you know when I was a professor my thought was almost the entire job of [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5764.28s)]
*  education is about [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5771.36s)]
*  Incentives it's not it's about incentives and motivation. It's not about [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5774.0s)]
*  Delivering content if you can get a student to want to understand something [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5779.799999999999s)]
*  Most of the work is done, right? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5785.92s)]
*  so [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5788.08s)]
*  When I look at school, I can't believe how badly structured it is because the idea is effectively it's gonna threaten you [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5789.04s)]
*  Into learning something that's not gonna make it stick. It's not gonna make you want to learn more [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5796.28s)]
*  Right. So my feeling is what you want is [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5801.48s)]
*  You want to create a [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5807.12s)]
*  Desire in the student to understand the thing [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5810.24s)]
*  then your work is pretty well done and then it's like play and [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5814.48s)]
*  If we took that approach to all of these things [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5818.2s)]
*  So that you felt rewarded by producing music even if it's very simple, right? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5821.48s)]
*  Well, then you might pick up music for a lifetime and be generating it decades later, right? [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5827.2s)]
*  right you you should not be delivered a message about sex where sex is something that is supposed to be [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5832.72s)]
*  perfected and [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5841.8s)]
*  Therefore a person who's new to that realm feels inadequate and [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5843.92s)]
*  Therefore is incentivized to abandon it and go watch it [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5849.44s)]
*  There should be a recognition that actually this is something that you will develop over a lifetime and [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5854.12s)]
*  It's important that you do and you should want it because it's access to some of the most rewarding stuff [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5860.0s)]
*  There is right. So just getting getting the motivation built in the person so that they want to pursue it is all you really need [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5866.04s)]
*  I'm really worried about robot sex dolls. Yep. I [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5874.200000000001s)]
*  Didn't used to be worried about them [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5878.64s)]
*  I joke around about it on stage [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5880.16s)]
*  But I'm actually worried about it now because I've seen some of the new ones that they've developed the new [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5881.36s)]
*  very lifelike human robots [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5886.88s)]
*  Which is by the way, they seem to be a lot of them are hot women for some reason [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5889.96s)]
*  Even though they're not sex robots. A lot of the robots are hot women [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5895.72s)]
*  What? Okay. I see what you're doing. Like you could do both things at the same time. Obviously the market is sex robots [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5899.4s)]
*  So what you're doing is you're having like robot assistants that happen to be really hot [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5905.0s)]
*  beautiful women [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5910.76s)]
*  Well, they're like pretty realistic right now not realistic [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5911.96s)]
*  Like I couldn't tell like if one was sitting there that that's a robot. You're a real person [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5916.04s)]
*  but go to pong and then go to [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5920.88s)]
*  Diablo 4, you know, you know I'm saying you know where it's coming [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5925.08s)]
*  It's it's only gonna get better than it is now and now it's pretty goddamn close. You're in the uncanny valley [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5929.64s)]
*  Yeah, you're in the uncanny valley and really what needs to happen in order that we do we don't [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5935.6s)]
*  Reproduce the disaster of porn with you know in 3d right or 4d [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5941.200000000001s)]
*  It needs to become [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5949.04s)]
*  Sophisticated to understand that you really don't want any part of that even if it's very good [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5952.6s)]
*  Especially if it's very good, but isn't that hard to do me? You can't even convince people that they don't want social media [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5958.84s)]
*  Well, you know, I used to take a lot of flack as a prude [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5963.64s)]
*  Because yeah, because well, I'm not a prude [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5969.64s)]
*  I'm really not but I do take a very dim view of porn [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5973.56s)]
*  it's like you're messing with something sacred and [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5978.52s)]
*  Just don't right and you know porn isn't what you and I remember porn was when we were young, right? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5981.8s)]
*  It's not pictures of naked girls [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5988.4400000000005s)]
*  Right, right. It's way more pernicious and invasive and coercive and instantaneously available [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5990.799999999999s)]
*  Instantaneously available and it reaches almost everybody now [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=5999.719999999999s)]
*  So anyway, I used to say very negative things about porn and I took a lot of flack over it [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6003.5599999999995s)]
*  That is less and less true. I think people are beginning to realize how much damage it's doing to them and [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6009.0s)]
*  There are a lot more people ready to acknowledge that whether or not they're in control of it in their own lives [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6015.56s)]
*  They wish they were [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6021.16s)]
*  Right. They don't want it. I will say, you know, I have two boys 18 and 20 and [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6022.92s)]
*  I believe neither of them is [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6030.2s)]
*  Involving themselves with porn and they report they aren't the only ones [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6033.96s)]
*  So young men are recognizing that it's a bad road to go down [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6037.8s)]
*  Well, you can see I think that road and the road of video games video games and porn together boy your life will vanish [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6042.32s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and it's not that video games aren't awesome. They're awesome, but I don't play them on purpose because I love them [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6050.24s)]
*  That's why I don't play them there. They're too [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6057.2s)]
*  Involving and they're not real life and they can steal real life [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6060.4s)]
*  Even though you're having a good time, right when I think back to the video games that I played which were of course, you know [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6064.96s)]
*  Much cruder. What was your video game of choice? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6071.0s)]
*  Well when I was really young when I was [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6074.759999999999s)]
*  You know a kid in high school. I used to play Castle Wolfenstein on my oh, yeah [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6077.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, wasn't that by the id software guys? [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6083.24s)]
*  I think there's the guys that designed doom and I'm pretty sure Castle Wolfenstein was them. I think that was their first game [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6087.96s)]
*  I don't know. Was it Jamie? Yeah [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6094.12s)]
*  That's a John Carmack and John Romero, but it was pretty cool [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6097.02s)]
*  But here's the problem [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6102.3s)]
*  with it [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6105.34s)]
*  Wasn't no no [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6107.18s)]
*  Different guys they had a game like that though [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6110.26s)]
*  My my brain that's they're connected but it's the Google says I mean says no. Mm-hmm who developed software [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6114.9800000000005s)]
*  But wait a minute wasn't didn't muse have something to do with it [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6122.26s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6127.46s)]
*  Looking at the games that muse software put out. They stopped putting them out in 85. Okay, and then doom was what year? [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6130.26s)]
*  So doom was definitely it and that was the first one. That was the first like real [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6136.7s)]
*  3d shooter game that just [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6142.18s)]
*  Captivated me that was 93 boy. I started playing doom and I was like this it's over [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6145.18s)]
*  Right, it's over but it's so crude if you watch it now. Yes [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6151.42s)]
*  They [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6155.099999999999s)]
*  John Carmack developed a new game engine called the doom engine while the rest of that software team finished Wolfenstein 3d prequel [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6156.339999999999s)]
*  So they made a game. Okay [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6162.24s)]
*  That's what it is. Okay. Yeah, so that was them but think about you know a video game is an incredible [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6164.259999999999s)]
*  Tool for training the mind sure right it trains you to just precisely [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6172.58s)]
*  Time things to have yourself in this mindset to know exactly where you are in the game to remember a sequence of moves [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6179.700000000001s)]
*  Whatever it is. It's an incredible training engine [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6186.860000000001s)]
*  because [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6191.5s)]
*  The incentive structure is there so that you want to get to the next level right? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6193.1s)]
*  It's like what schools should be doing except. What does it train you to do? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6197.76s)]
*  Nothing as soon as the next game captivates you all of the skills that you invested in building [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6202.780000000001s)]
*  Are almost all wiped away [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6209.26s)]
*  now maybe that's not quite true because all the first-person shooters are the same and so skills you develop in [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6210.860000000001s)]
*  halo work for I don't know what the others would be but [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6216.38s)]
*  But nonetheless the point is you're you're investing [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6220.14s)]
*  Your ability to train your own mind into something that is guaranteed to be obsolete [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6223.620000000001s)]
*  Mmm, that's not a good use of your time even though I totally you know, I did play video games [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6229.54s)]
*  But you know what the argument against that is the same argument against chess so chess [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6234.94s)]
*  Obviously trains the mind to be stronger and more effective in many other areas of life [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6241.0599999999995s)]
*  One of things they found about video games is surgeons in particular that play video games have 25% less errors. Mmm [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6246.62s)]
*  Well, that makes sense at the number that was the number right? It was like 25% [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6253.86s)]
*  However high number but imagine that you decided to leverage that [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6259.379999999999s)]
*  in fact, I mean my feeling is school ought to look like a bunch of [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6264.98s)]
*  Fun exercises and activities and puzzles that cause you to want to do it. It shouldn't have to be school [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6270.78s)]
*  We shouldn't have to make you go it should be structured so that you want to be there because it's exciting [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6276.58s)]
*  It draws you in and so a video game [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6282.419999999999s)]
*  I'm not against them in principle because a video game could train you to do something or to think about something in some [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6285.5599999999995s)]
*  Incredible way [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6293.5599999999995s)]
*  but they just don't because the market is gonna find the thing that brings in the maximum number of people and [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6294.719999999999s)]
*  Holds them to the greatest effect and causes them to want to buy the sequel, right? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6300.4s)]
*  Isn't there there's a balance though between discipline and inspiration and one of the things that school does teach you is you have to be disciplined [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6304.36s)]
*  You have to actually get your homework done. You have to actually do things you have to do things. You don't want to do [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6311.74s)]
*  Delayed gratification. I think that's actually an important component to life that if you want to be successful [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6317.24s)]
*  Even in things that you're inspired to do you have to be willing to work when you're not inspired and that's where discipline comes in [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6323.36s)]
*  wisdom I [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6330.599999999999s)]
*  argue is [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6332.2s)]
*  effectively delayed gratification mmm that you know [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6334.12s)]
*  Figuring out that investment now that doing something it doesn't feel good now right in a big reward later [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6338.28s)]
*  That's a huge part of the key to life and in part. That's what all of these consumer [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6343.84s)]
*  realms that are stealing from us are [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6350.2s)]
*  Taking away is the point is if you want to be [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6353.04s)]
*  investing in something and you're willing to pay the price of whatever unpleasantness or time or whatever it is that you're spending and [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6357.599999999999s)]
*  You've got all of these competing things that can give you a you know, a hit of dopamine right now [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6364.5599999999995s)]
*  It's very hard to look to develop that skill. Mmm. Yeah, that makes sense [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6369.5599999999995s)]
*  And this also this sort of entitled world that we live in where we're so used to things being instantaneous and immediate [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6375.04s)]
*  Gratification that that becomes a kind of a core tenant of how we interface with the world [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6382.12s)]
*  We only are interested in things that give us things right away [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6386.68s)]
*  You know Heather and I used to teach a an exercise [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6390.16s)]
*  Something we invented called learn a skill where we would have students define any skill that they wish to learn [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6394.28s)]
*  It had only one requirement the requirement was it had to be [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6401.24s)]
*  Objective whether you had succeeded or failed couldn't be subjective [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6405.84s)]
*  Right, okay, and the idea was not to get you to learn the skill that was a [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6409.52s)]
*  Collateral benefit the idea was to get you to pay attention to how you develop a skill so that you would learn how your own [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6415.84s)]
*  Mind learns and you could apply that to things that you wanted to learn later in life [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6422.36s)]
*  But what we often found was that these students these would have been Millennials [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6426.84s)]
*  Were very unrealistic [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6432.88s)]
*  About how much effort it would go would be required for them to accomplish one of these things [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6435.84s)]
*  Mmm, and they would just get schooled by how much harder it was to build the thing they wanted to build or to [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6442.24s)]
*  Program the computer to do the thing that they wanted to program it to do or to play the song they were hoping to play [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6450.56s)]
*  Something had trained them that life was easier than it was and [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6458.72s)]
*  That was kind of a tragic lesson right right and I do the trust fund kid [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6462.32s)]
*  It's the same sort of a thing. Yeah, but these weren't trust fund [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6468.2s)]
*  But I mean, I don't mean that it's the the what a trust fund kid has they want things handed to them all the time [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6471.04s)]
*  And we've kind of like set up a whole society where kids think that things should just be theirs [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6477.44s)]
*  Totally. Yeah, and also we've set up a society where people become exceptional with no merit [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6482.48s)]
*  Right like social media influencers and and tick-tock influencers are people that they just captivate attention [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6488.679999999999s)]
*  whether it's by [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6495.88s)]
*  You know click-baity headlines or whatever they're doing or just like being hot and dancing around in front of the screen [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6497.28s)]
*  they're doing that and [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6504.4s)]
*  That has become one of the main things that children aspire to [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6506.599999999999s)]
*  When they ask kids what they want to do one of the big things the kids want now is to be famous [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6510.88s)]
*  It's much more prevalent than it ever was in history [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6515.5199999999995s)]
*  Because before it was really hard to be famous if you wanted to be famous you had to be a real psycho [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6519.599999999999s)]
*  Like you had to be like completely ignored by everyone around you to the point [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6523.5199999999995s)]
*  We're like, you know what? God damn it. I am special and I'm gonna show the world [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6526.719999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna be on that stage singing that song or whatever it was, you know being in that movie on that big screen and you had [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6529.96s)]
*  A really want it [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6536.799999999999s)]
*  You ought to be really sick to get to the top and a lot of them really were and that's how you made it [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6538.28s)]
*  You know [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6543.96s)]
*  And so it was a very rare thing that most people did not aspire to because they didn't think it was a realistic goal [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6544.6s)]
*  But now people see people that are nothing there's nothing special about them and they're billionaires, you know [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6549.84s)]
*  Like if you watch the Kardashians, I yeah, they're they're cute. Okay, they have nice clothes [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6555.64s)]
*  But you like the whole show is based on very boring people who are living these extremely privileged lives [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6560.56s)]
*  For no reason that anybody can explain that makes any sense [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6568.52s)]
*  They've generated hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars through [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6572.18s)]
*  No way that anybody could like map out and say like this is how you do it [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6576.26s)]
*  Yeah, there's no lesson to no lesson to it all but yet they're the people that people want to aspire to [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6581.5s)]
*  Yes, I think that's a I think [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6587.26s)]
*  We get a warped perspective because you you know, which names do you know? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6591.780000000001s)]
*  Well, you write the people who have succeeded in this realm and you don't know all the people who've invested heavily in it and not [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6595.62s)]
*  Succeeded right but on the other hand [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6600.92s)]
*  the [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6603.56s)]
*  Internet as it stands is a training program for this. So in part the reason [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6604.88s)]
*  The reason that people become focused on the things that they become good at is because they get some [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6613.24s)]
*  Early reward that causes them to return and try to do more [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6619.76s)]
*  right, I'm convinced this is true if you went back to the things that [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6624.320000000001s)]
*  Each of us are good at you would find some early experience that caused us to stick to it enough that we ended up good [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6628.04s)]
*  but [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6634.4s)]
*  Everybody is in these social media environments [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6635.959999999999s)]
*  competing for likes I mean even just inadvertently you don't want to put up a post and have nobody [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6640.16s)]
*  React to it. You hope they react and you hope they react positively [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6647.2s)]
*  So the internet is training people to be influencers. Most of them are not going to make it [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6651.28s)]
*  you know, it's it's it's like the sports stars who become the irresistible icons in [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6658.24s)]
*  certain communities because obviously [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6665.0s)]
*  That's you know, that's a whole different world of possibilities, right? So, you know, it brings everybody in well in this case [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6668.5599999999995s)]
*  You've got everybody in a de facto training program to be an influencer and almost none of them are gonna get there [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6675.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6682.400000000001s)]
*  But they do have their call of duty so they could just play that and just jerk off all day and get their UBI and yeah [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6684.400000000001s)]
*  We have to talk about evolution because one of the things that [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6693.88s)]
*  Tucker Carlson said on the podcast was essentially that you can't really prove evolution. It's not real [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6697.6s)]
*  He doesn't believe in evolution as it's taught. Yep. I'm paraphrasing. Yeah, I went back and listened to it [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6704.120000000001s)]
*  What did he exactly say? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6710.2s)]
*  He said well, he said a couple things. It was a little confusing. He said that [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6711.96s)]
*  You know, we we see evidence of adaptation [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6717.639999999999s)]
*  But we don't see evidence of evolution and that we've really gotten [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6721.72s)]
*  beyond [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6727.24s)]
*  The Darwinian model we've essentially come to understand that it's not right. This is essentially an argument for creationism [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6728.36s)]
*  It's an it's an argument for [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6735.24s)]
*  Intelligent intelligent design, okay, I think first of all, I want to clean up a little bit of what he said just so it's interpretable [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6738.16s)]
*  Okay, I don't really think he means we see the evidence for adaptation but not evolution that that's not [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6744.5599999999995s)]
*  Coherent, I think what he means is we see evidence for what we would call micro evolution [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6751.599999999999s)]
*  But we don't see evidence for what we would call macro evolution. This is a [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6757.679999999999s)]
*  commonly believed thing in intelligent design circles [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6762.92s)]
*  So micro evolution we would talk about the way a [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6767.599999999999s)]
*  Creature or a population of creatures would change relative to their environment if the environment gets drier those [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6771.5199999999995s)]
*  individuals who are more [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6778.639999999999s)]
*  drought tolerant will outcompete the individuals that require more water and so we'll see the population change over time but [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6781.2s)]
*  He's saying we don't see evidence for macro evolution, which is the production of new species from old species [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6788.679999999999s)]

*  You really ought to let me talk to you about what's actually going on here and he welcomed it [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6819.44s)]

*  What do you think most people want? I think people want the [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6848.84s)]

*  Tucker's concern isn't based in science and [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6866.96s)]
*  They can go back to feeling comfortable that you know, the darwinists have it well in hand [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6871.84s)]

*  I could do that, but I don't feel honorable doing that. I think as a scientist [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6882.120000000001s)]
*  I should not be in the business of persuading people. I [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6888.4800000000005s)]

*  I want them to persuade you but I don't think I'm allowed to persuade you. I think that it's a [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6897.96s)]

*  Although Tucker I do not believe is right in the end [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6930.88s)]

*  Telling a kind of lie about how much we know and what remains to be understood [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6952.679999999999s)]

*  All that being said [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6980.4s)]
*  Let me say I [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6982.36s)]
*  Think modern Darwinism is broken [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6984.48s)]
*  Yes, I do think I know more or less how to fix it [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6987.16s)]
*  I'm annoyed at my colleagues for I think lying to themselves about the state of modern Darwinism [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6990.900000000001s)]
*  I think they know I think I know why that happened. I think they were concerned that a [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=6997.3s)]
*  creationist worldview was always a threat that it would reassert itself and so they pretended that Darwinism was a more complete [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7003.78s)]
*  Explanation as it was presented than it ever was what is wrong with Darwinism? [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7012.54s)]
*  Like what do you think that Darwinism is doing itself at the service by saying there are several different things that are wrong with it [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7016.94s)]
*  the key one that I think is causing [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7024.099999999999s)]
*  folks in intelligent design circles to begin to catch up is [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7028.0199999999995s)]
*  That the story we tell about how it is that [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7034.66s)]
*  Mutation results in [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7040.66s)]
*  In [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7043.18s)]
*  Morphological change is [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7045.42s)]
*  Incorrect this is a very hard thing to convey and I want to point out that [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7048.820000000001s)]
*  If the explanation for creatures is Darwinian [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7056.620000000001s)]
*  That does not depend on [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7062.22s)]
*  Anybody understanding it and it does not depend on anybody being able to phrase it in a way that it's intuitive [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7064.54s)]
*  Okay, I think I could probably do a decent job on those fronts, but if you happened on to the earth a [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7070.9s)]
*  Hundred million years ago [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7078.54s)]
*  You would have found lots of animals running around lots of plants growing you would have recognized [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7080.259999999999s)]
*  Where you were and more or less what was going on? [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7086.339999999999s)]
*  It's not a single creature on the planet that would have any idea what an abstract thought was there would be no creature that had [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7088.98s)]
*  Inking that there was even a question about where all this had come from and Darwinism would still be the answer [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7095.14s)]
*  So somehow whether Darwinism is the answer does not depend on anybody knowing it or being able to explain it. Okay [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7100.740000000001s)]
*  Here here's the problem let's say that we went into the parking lot and [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7112.740000000001s)]
*  in [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7118.22s)]
*  one parking space there's an excavator and [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7119.5s)]
*  In the next parking space over is a Maserati [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7122.820000000001s)]
*  now let's say we took those two machines and [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7127.580000000001s)]
*  We tore them apart [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7131.780000000001s)]
*  so that we just had a stack of the compounds that they were made out of right the rubber the vinyl the [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7135.02s)]
*  Various metals all that stuff there would be differences between the excavator and the Maserati, right? [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7141.620000000001s)]
*  They would just be made of some different stuff and then there'd be a lot of stuff that they had in common [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7148.9s)]
*  Now you could look at the differences in the materials that they're made out of and you could say [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7153.38s)]
*  Well, the excavator is really good at you know [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7160.0599999999995s)]
*  lifting materials and moving them around and the Maserati is really good at going fast on a paved surface and [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7163.339999999999s)]
*  Those differences are due to the differences in materials that they're made of [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7171.259999999999s)]
*  That would be wrong [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7176.62s)]
*  Probably you could take the list of materials that an excavator is made out of and you could give it to a bunch of engineers [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7179.38s)]
*  And you could say I want you to make a Maserati, but you're limited to these materials and they could do it [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7185.94s)]
*  Wouldn't be quite as good because there'd be some places where the ideal material wasn't available to them anymore [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7192.58s)]
*  But there's no reason you couldn't make a Maserati out of the sports car, right? Yeah [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7197.82s)]
*  so [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7202.62s)]
*  What that means is there are chemical differences between an excavator and a sports car [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7205.62s)]
*  But they're not the story of the differences in what those two creatures do the chemistry differences are incidental [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7212.0599999999995s)]
*  Now when we tell you that the differences that a bat became a flying mammal [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7220.04s)]
*  Because it had a shrew like ancestor and that shrew like ancestor had a genome [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7227.0199999999995s)]
*  Spelled out in three-letter codons those three-letter codons specify amino acids of which there are 20 and that [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7232.56s)]
*  the difference between the bat and [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7239.68s)]
*  the shrew is [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7242.2s)]
*  Based in the differences in the proteins that are described by the genome [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7244.32s)]
*  We are essentially saying that the difference between the bat and the shrew is a chemical difference [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7250.72s)]
*  It's not a simple chemical difference the way it was when we were talking about excavators and sports cars [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7257.679999999999s)]
*  But nonetheless, it's a biochemical difference, right? [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7263.879999999999s)]
*  The difference in the spelling of its proteins and structural structural proteins and enzymes and all of that stuff. I [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7266.799999999999s)]
*  Don't believe that mechanism is [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7274.44s)]
*  nearly powerful enough to explain how a [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7277.799999999999s)]
*  shrew like ancestor [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7281.92s)]
*  Became a bat. So what do you think is missing? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7284.16s)]
*  There's a whole layer that is missing that allows [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7286.959999999999s)]
*  Evolution to explore [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7293.12s)]
*  Design space much more efficiently than the mechanism that we invoke and the mechanism we invoke is natural selection [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7295.48s)]
*  adaptation the mechanism [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7303.799999999999s)]
*  That's the one. Okay, the mechanism that we invoke is random mutation random mutation, which I believe in random mutation happens [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7306.4s)]
*  Selection which chooses those variants that are produced by mutation and collects the ones that give the creature an advantage [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7315.7s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that story. That story is true [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7323.54s)]
*  Okay, random mutations happen selection collects the ones that are good and those collected [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7326.94s)]
*  Advantages mutations accumulate in the genome all of that is true [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7333.42s)]
*  What I'm arguing against is the idea that that [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7337.58s)]
*  transforms a shrew into a bat [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7341.74s)]
*  What you need to get a shrew turned into a bat is a much less crude mechanism whereby selection [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7345.7s)]
*  Which is ancient at the point that you have shrews [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7354.099999999999s)]
*  Explores design space looking for ways to be that are yet undiscovered [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7359.179999999999s)]
*  more systematically than random chance and what would be that [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7366.46s)]
*  Well, what is that force it's not a force what is that desire that what is that [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7372.38s)]
*  I believe there's a kind of information stored in genomes that is not in triplet codon form [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7378.26s)]
*  That is much more of a type that would be familiar to a designer [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7384.74s)]
*  either of machines or a programmer that [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7391.22s)]
*  What we did was we took the random mutation [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7396.34s)]
*  Model and [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7400.9800000000005s)]
*  We recognized that it was Darwinian which it is and [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7405.26s)]
*  We therefore assumed that it would explain anything that we could see that was clearly the product of Darwinian forces on [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7410.820000000001s)]
*  The basis of those random mutations and we skipped the layer in between in which [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7419.5s)]
*  Selection has a different kind of information stored in the genome that is not triplet codon in nature. So [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7424.3s)]
*  So there's an information stored in the genome that is motivating it to seek new forms [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7432.58s)]
*  No, not motivating allowing allowing it allow. So what's the motivation to seek new forms? Oh the motivation was there. It's [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7438.78s)]
*  Primordial so the point is [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7446.0599999999995s)]
*  Let me try by analogy, okay [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7451.0199999999995s)]
*  Darwinists will tell you that evolution cannot look forward [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7454.38s)]
*  It can only look backward and there's a way in which that's just simply true on the other hand [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7457.54s)]
*  A darwinist will also tell you that you are a product of evolution and you can look forward [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7462.62s)]
*  Right. Mm-hmm. So if evolution can't look forward, but it can build a creature that can [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7468.94s)]
*  Then can evolution look forward? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7475.259999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I think it effectively can so my point is that random mutation mechanism [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7477.54s)]
*  Is in a race to produce new forms that are better adapted to the world than their ancestors [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7483.339999999999s)]
*  What if it can bias the game it can enhance its own ability to search? [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7491.86s)]
*  Right, if you lose your keys [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7497.5s)]
*  You don't search randomly [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7500.259999999999s)]
*  Right, you go through a systematic process of search and that systematic product process of search results in you finding your keys sooner [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7502.66s)]
*  Than you would otherwise so we should expect evolution to find every trick it can access [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7510.62s)]
*  To increase the rate at which it discovers forms that would be useful in the habitat in question [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7516.54s)]
*  Okay, and this is simply that I'm not really saying anything that extraordinary right if I say [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7522.74s)]
*  You know [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7529.5s)]
*  Do you know that computers? [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7530.9s)]
*  All they do is binary [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7534.3s)]
*  Well, that's true [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7536.62s)]
*  But if you then imagine that that means that the people who program computers do it in binary [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7538.66s)]
*  Well, there was a time when that was true [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7544.7s)]
*  But it's not true anymore. It's not how you do it [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7547.0599999999995s)]
*  There's a much more efficient way to program a computer and it involves a programming language, which a computer itself can't understand [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7549.34s)]
*  But you can build a computer [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7556.7s)]
*  That can either interpret the language in real time or you can build a computer [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7558.94s)]
*  That can accept the code as it's spit out by a compiler these are [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7564.0199999999995s)]
*  Mechanisms to radically increase the effectiveness of a program. Mmm, but it all comes out [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7568.82s)]
*  Binary anyway, right in the end. That's really what I'm arguing is that there's [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7574.94s)]
*  the initial layer of [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7580.179999999999s)]
*  Darwinian stuff [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7582.419999999999s)]
*  The random mutation layer that it looks like what we teach people [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7583.94s)]
*  there's another layer which we're not well familiar with and it results in [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7588.62s)]
*  a much more powerful capacity to adapt than we can explain with that first mechanism, which is why guys like [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7593.94s)]
*  like Tucker [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7602.139999999999s)]
*  Think there's just something these Darwinists. They keep telling me that the shrew [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7603.74s)]
*  Becomes a bat and then they go on this rant about the random mutations and the triplet codons and the you know [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7608.9s)]
*  Mutations that actually turn out to be good. It's just not powerful enough and they're not wrong [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7616.94s)]
*  They're detecting something real and frankly, you know Tucker is the layperson example of this you've had Stephen Meyer on [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7622.54s)]
*  You know, he's actually he's a scientist who's quite good and he's spotted that the mechanism in question isn't [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7631.38s)]
*  Powerful enough to explain the phenomena that we swear it explains and so he's catching up [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7639.42s)]
*  but that's really on the Darwinists for not admitting what they can't yet explain and [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7644.82s)]
*  Pursuing it which is what they should be doing. Mmm. What do you think that force is? [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7650.38s)]
*  It's not a force so I don't know how much of this I've made clear but if you fill in the missing layer, mm-hmm [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7657.54s)]
*  it's [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7666.94s)]
*  purely Darwinian [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7668.299999999999s)]
*  None of this establishes that Darwin had but it's just a different mechanism. It's another Darwinian mechanism [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7670.299999999999s)]
*  Right, I mean and let me this is there's nothing strange about this if you think about the way a human being works [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7676.660000000001s)]
*  compared to let's say a starfish a [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7683.620000000001s)]
*  human being [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7688.02s)]
*  has a software layer a [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7689.580000000001s)]
*  cognitive layer in which the human being is born into an environment and that environment could be you know a hunter-gatherer [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7693.620000000001s)]
*  environment of ten thousand years ago, or it could be a modern environment and [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7701.46s)]
*  The human being doesn't have to be [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7707.099999999999s)]
*  Modified at the level of its genome in order to function differently in those two environments. It has to be sensitive [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7709.94s)]
*  To the information in those environments so that it can become adapted to them [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7716.98s)]
*  developmentally [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7722.259999999999s)]
*  right, so [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7723.78s)]
*  Development is one trick that the genome uses to make a human being more flexible than other creatures [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7726.78s)]
*  Right. You do not come out of the womb being ready to do human stuff [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7734.74s)]
*  Right, you are profoundly hobbled by not having a complete program [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7740.9s)]
*  But it means that the program you develop can be highly attuned to your particular moment in time and location in space [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7745.5s)]
*  that is [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7752.38s)]
*  the Darwinian [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7754.26s)]
*  Mechanisms that store information the genome solving an [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7756.54s)]
*  Evolutionary problem in a different way. So this is already a second layer that doesn't function like that random mutation layer. Okay [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7761.06s)]
*  so [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7769.06s)]
*  evolution [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7770.38s)]
*  should be expected to find all of the cheat codes and [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7771.62s)]
*  to build them in because any creature that has [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7776.54s)]
*  Access to all of these different ways of adapting more rapidly or more effectively [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7780.740000000001s)]
*  Will out compete the creatures that have fewer of these things so you should expect [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7786.26s)]
*  What I often say is we have to remember we are not looking at [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7790.22s)]
*  Darwinism [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7795.42s)]
*  1.0 [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7797.18s)]
*  You're looking at Darwinism 10.0. You're looking at a highly sophisticated [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7798.38s)]
*  evolutionary [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7803.620000000001s)]
*  Structure that is the result of all of the discoveries of the prior structures and that includes [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7805.0599999999995s)]
*  some things that modern creatures can do but it also includes an [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7810.98s)]
*  evolution of [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7816.7s)]
*  enhanced evolutionary capacity including things like culture [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7818.62s)]
*  So it's not just a mechanism but an accelerator it's an accelerator because that's how you compete [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7825.099999999999s)]
*  Oh [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7831.5s)]
*  The faster you adapt and so this is one of the other things that I think needs to be corrected about Darwinism [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7832.7s)]
*  We have a very crude a primitive understanding of what fitness means [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7838.78s)]
*  Right. We know that it's important that it's sort of the core thing that selection is trying to accomplish enhanced fitness [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7845.22s)]
*  But we pretend that that means the same thing as reproduction often. It's very tightly correlated to reproduction [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7851.62s)]
*  But if you think it's the same [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7858.0199999999995s)]
*  You just miss out on all of the places where reproduction is not the key to lasting a long time into the future [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7860.0199999999995s)]
*  Which is really the trick that selection is [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7867.34s)]
*  targeted at [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7871.62s)]
*  right selection is always [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7873.0599999999995s)]
*  Trying to get a creature to lodge its [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7875.46s)]
*  Genomic spellings as far into the future as it can as it can land them, right? So that means [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7878.54s)]
*  One way to do that is often to produce more offspring. That's a good way to increase the likelihood that your genome makes it into the future [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7885.9400000000005s)]
*  but [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7893.22s)]
*  That's of limited value. Let's say that you're in a population that is [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7895.3s)]
*  In jeopardy, but you as an individual are highly successful. So maybe you [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7900.9800000000005s)]
*  Have ten offspring, right? You beat the [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7906.54s)]
*  expectation by five times [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7909.62s)]
*  But then your population goes extinct a hundred years after you're gone [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7912.14s)]
*  Right near your fitness could be high based on how many offspring you produced or it could be zero based on the ultimate outcome [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7917.0199999999995s)]
*  of what happened to all of your descendants, right my claim is [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7923.78s)]
*  your fitness was actually zero and [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7928.14s)]
*  You should have adjusted what you did to increase the likelihood that your population would endure whatever ultimately challenged it and not [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7930.58s)]
*  Invested so much in producing your own offspring because that didn't end up being productive [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7939.18s)]
*  So there are lots of cases where [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7944.42s)]
*  Producing more offspring and at increasing your reproductive success is not actually a key [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7948.66s)]
*  to increasing your fitness as I would instantiate it and it is fitness that selection is targeted at [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7955.22s)]
*  But when we pretend that fitness is something you should be able to measure we screw up Darwinism [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7962.86s)]
*  So that's another one of these [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7968.66s)]
*  correctives [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7971.099999999999s)]
*  How do you think we can? [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7972.86s)]
*  measure this [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7975.9s)]
*  Other mechanism is there a way to sort of quantify what's going on or is it? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7978.0599999999995s)]
*  Is it abstract? [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7984.86s)]
*  I think the problem is the instinct that we should be able to measure it [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7987.139999999999s)]
*  It's not that kind of parameter and I think it's perfectly fine to say [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7992.139999999999s)]
*  A reproductive success tends to be very closely correlated with fitness [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=7996.46s)]
*  And we can measure reproductive success [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8003.1s)]
*  But we have to recognize that when you imagine that they are synonymous [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8005.46s)]
*  Any place where producing more offspring is counterproductive to getting into the future? [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8011.06s)]
*  We will be confused by and we are confused by them [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8017.820000000001s)]
*  So [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8020.54s)]
*  This this mechanism like I [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8023.78s)]
*  Guess the biggest example of a mystery like how did how did a creature do what it did is us? [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8026.78s)]
*  Mm-hmm. We're the biggest [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8034.42s)]
*  Weirdos in the entire planet. Yep. So what do you think led us to accelerate so far ahead of? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8036.34s)]
*  this process [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8044.86s)]
*  My advisor I believe nailed the answer to that question. We're as a guy named dick Alexander [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8046.62s)]
*  He was a marvelous human being and a very insightful biologist [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8052.24s)]
*  His argument was that human beings or our ancestors [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8057.94s)]
*  attained a kind of [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8065.38s)]

*  superiority where [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8070.38s)]
*  The most important dictator of whether or not you evolutionarily succeeded or failed was your competition with other humans and [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8072.42s)]
*  So his point which I think is accurate is [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8081.06s)]
*  that [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8085.38s)]
*  it is humans in a an [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8086.82s)]
*  Arms race with other humans that caused the radical [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8090.78s)]
*  elaboration of our capacity to [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8096.06s)]

*  abstractions [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8101.66s)]
*  Now I would add to that Heather and I have written on this [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8103.9400000000005s)]
*  that the mechanism [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8108.18s)]
*  We argue that there is a flip-flop that will happen in [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8110.58s)]
*  Evolutionary modes for human beings. So as we talked about a few minutes ago [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8116.62s)]
*  Humans are special in the sense that the genome which is still the thing that is trying to get into the future [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8120.9400000000005s)]
*  has solved [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8128.5s)]
*  Genome problems by offloading the adaptive capacity to our software layer, right? [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8130.3s)]
*  Once your software layer has the capacity to adapt and is not tethered to changes in your genome [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8138.66s)]
*  Well now you can evolve very rapidly, but how do you do it and [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8146.42s)]
*  What what Heather and I argued in our book is that there is a flip-flop between two modes of [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8150.780000000001s)]
*  Cognitive [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8157.42s)]
*  Functioning for humans [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8162.1s)]
*  one of them is the mode that you employ when [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8164.22s)]
*  Your relationship to your environment is very much like your ancestors relationship to their environment [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8167.62s)]
*  So in other words if you are in a circumstance and your grandparents knew how to live in the place that you live [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8175.46s)]
*  It does not make sense to be trying to figure out some new way to be [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8182.820000000001s)]
*  What makes sense is for you to do whatever they were doing and maybe improve it if you could figure out how [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8188.66s)]
*  But in general what you should do is you should accept the ancestral wisdom in a cultural form and you should learn to do [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8194.42s)]
*  Whatever it is your people do and you should do it as well as you can and upgrade it if that's an opportunity [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8202.380000000001s)]
*  But there comes a place either in space or in time [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8208.66s)]
*  When whatever it is that your ancestors were doing is no longer productive [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8213.22s)]
*  right, so if you imagine that [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8218.1s)]
*  Your people are I don't know maybe you [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8220.619999999999s)]
*  Hunt elk [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8224.58s)]
*  Well if we move far enough across space there'll be some place where there aren't elk [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8228.14s)]
*  Right where the habitat isn't hospitable to them. Maybe it's too dry [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8233.58s)]
*  And so you could take the ancestral wisdom that talks about how to hunt elk or you could recognize that that's not very productive here [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8238.539999999999s)]
*  And we need to do something else [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8246.9s)]
*  So, I don't know exactly what it is that you'll move to but you'll have to innovate some new way of being, you know [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8248.939999999999s)]
*  Maybe you'll take up [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8255.779999999999s)]
*  I don't know [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8258.22s)]
*  hunting smaller game [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8260.3s)]
*  right [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8262.02s)]
*  Or maybe you'll take up gathering some material or maybe you'll invent farming [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8263.34s)]
*  But the point is wherever you are in either space or time that your ancestors wisdom is no longer highly productive [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8268.98s)]
*  You will be triggered into this second mode which we would call consciousness [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8277.02s)]
*  So the first mode is culture [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8281.22s)]
*  Second mode is consciousness and the idea of consciousness is that human beings have the capability of doing something no other creature can do [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8283.26s)]
*  We can exchange abstract ideas between individuals and that means and we use the metaphor of a campfire for this [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8291.279999999999s)]
*  that a human population will gather around the campfire at night and [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8298.72s)]
*  They will talk about whatever they've observed in their habitat and they will talk about what opportunities there are there and how those opportunities might be [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8303.4s)]
*  exploited and they will [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8313.119999999999s)]
*  parallel process the puzzle [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8315.519999999999s)]
*  Right every member of the group has different skills and insights and so in talking about how the new opportunities [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8317.68s)]
*  Might be exploited they will come up with some prototype for a new way of being [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8325.960000000001s)]
*  so [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8331.0s)]
*  the argument I've made is [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8332.36s)]
*  When during normal times your ancestors knew pretty well how to exploit the habitat that you'll be born into you should take their wisdom [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8335.28s)]
*  and deploy it if [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8342.44s)]
*  You are at the edge of that habitat or you are at the point where that habitat changes and it isn't any longer productive to try [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8344.08s)]
*  To do what your ancestors did you will engage in this conscious? [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8350.92s)]
*  Exchange of [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8356.24s)]
*  insight [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8357.84s)]
*  Consciousness that will allow you to innovate a new niche and at the point you've got that new niche pretty well figured out [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8359.12s)]
*  It will be turned into a culture that will be passed on to future generations until it's no longer useful [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8365.48s)]
*  So that process accounts we believe for the [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8372.16s)]
*  Radical variation in niches that human beings inhabit [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8379.960000000001s)]
*  Right thousands of niches over the history of our species. That's unlike any other creature for any other creature [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8385.16s)]
*  Once you've named the species you've pretty much named a niche [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8393.08s)]
*  Right some way of being that that species engages in for human beings. This isn't true human beings are like [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8397.84s)]
*  thousands of different species the differences between them there are some [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8404.6s)]
*  Physical differences, but most of those differences between the de facto species that exist within our overarching species [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8409.84s)]
*  Most of those differences are housed in the cultural layer [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8416.8s)]
*  Right. They're software. They're not hardware. That is an amazing [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8420.64s)]
*  Capability for a creature to have the ability to switch niches in this way and therefore [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8425.119999999999s)]
*  Adopt every continent [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8432.519999999999s)]
*  Every habitat except the Arctic has been made productive by people in this way. But the question is like why us? [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8435.359999999999s)]
*  Why why has the human animal? [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8442.199999999999s)]
*  Been able to do this and no other animal has done anything remotely similar [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8445.119999999999s)]
*  Well, I think that goes back to to my advisors insight the idea that once human beings become their own [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8450.08s)]
*  primary [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8458.759999999998s)]
*  Competitor the the primary dictator of the success of a population is how it does against another population that is similarly equipped [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8460.0s)]
*  that arms race [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8467.16s)]
*  produces [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8469.08s)]
*  incredible problem-solving capability it's why our [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8470.279999999999s)]
*  Craniums were expanded as they were why our raw [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8474.16s)]
*  Processing power is so large compared to our next nearest relative [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8478.68s)]
*  It's that capacity which then allowed human beings to become [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8483.52s)]
*  regular niche switching creatures [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8488.960000000001s)]
*  But don't other animals compete with other animals, yeah, they compete but they don't have the you know, most animals have many [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8492.560000000001s)]
*  arbiters of their [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8502.0s)]
*  success, right they have [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8504.28s)]
*  You know biotic arbiters competing species they've got members of their own species [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8506.960000000001s)]
*  they've got a biotic factors such as you know climate and weather and [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8512.640000000001s)]
*  those factors mean that [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8518.6s)]
*  they're a multiplicity of [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8520.960000000001s)]
*  Hostile forces for human beings we became our own primary hostile force and that created the arms race [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8524.480000000001s)]
*  So one population against another can you out think your competitors? [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8530.68s)]
*  And then the accelerants are language and tools once you get to language this thing catches fire and [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8535.76s)]
*  That leads to adaptations of the physical body. Well, it feeds back into it for sure [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8542.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because you just you don't need the the armaments for example [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8547.300000000001s)]
*  It's just stunning that no other species out of all the species that exists on this planet has done anything of remotely similar [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8552.84s)]
*  Yeah on a pathway [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8560.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know there are there are others that are [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8562.84s)]
*  That have many of the rudiments, you know like dolphins. Yeah, Heather and I talk about the the usual suspects [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8567.52s)]
*  You've got dolphins including orcas. You've got [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8574.72s)]
*  Wolves you've got other great apes. You've got crows [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8578.72s)]
*  Parrots there are a lot of creatures that have some of the magic that human beings have but none of them have all of the [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8583.359999999999s)]
*  components [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8589.96s)]
*  So [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8592.76s)]
*  This is why intelligence design people get [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8594.16s)]
*  Kind of tripped up by all this because right they say explain us. There's something else working here. There's some magic [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8597.76s)]
*  There's some higher power. Well, let me and maybe that is a higher power. Maybe that other mechanism is something special [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8604.279999999999s)]
*  Well, it is something special to be sure that the couple things that need to be said here are a I am [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8612.0s)]
*  Sympathetic to the intelligent design folks, though. I do not believe they are on the right track [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8620.4s)]
*  I'm open to a universe with a intelligence behind it, but I've seen no evidence of that universe myself [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8626.6s)]
*  I'm open to it. If it happens, I will I will look at it, but I [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8634.68s)]
*  Believe this can all be explained in Darwinian terms and more to the point I would I [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8639.48s)]
*  Would highlight the fact that they don't really have a competing explanation [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8647.16s)]
*  so the [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8653.6s)]
*  fundamental [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8655.32s)]
*  Principle of reason is parsimony [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8657.16s)]
*  That the simplest explanation [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8661.44s)]
*  We would typically say the simplest explanation tends to be right in my opinion [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8665.119999999999s)]
*  If we had all of the information the simplest explanation would always be right [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8669.64s)]
*  It would be a more reliable law, but in general the simplest explanation tends to be right if you [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8675.56s)]
*  Take the intelligent design folks and you extrapolate from what they seem to be suggesting [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8683.44s)]
*  they do not escape a [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8689.960000000001s)]
*  necessity for a Darwinian explanation [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8692.64s)]
*  even if the creatures of earth were designed on a [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8695.68s)]
*  drawing board by a creature that wanted to make them [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8700.08s)]
*  that [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8703.88s)]
*  creature has to have come from somewhere and the only explanation that has ever been proposed for where such a creature could have come from is [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8705.119999999999s)]
*  Darwinian evolution so [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8713.16s)]
*  To me the problem with intelligent design the most fundamental one is that even if it were true [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8715.4s)]
*  You've basically solved the problem of explaining [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8722.359999999999s)]
*  Earth's creatures at a cost that is a [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8726.4s)]
*  Million times worse in terms of parsimony if it's hard to explain a tiger [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8732.08s)]
*  through [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8739.36s)]
*  Darwinian processes it is that much harder yet to explain a tiger designer [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8740.76s)]
*  so the point is [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8749.6s)]
*  Sooner or later you're gonna reach for Darwinism because there's literally no competitor. There's nothing else anyone has ever [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8751.800000000001s)]
*  Said that could even in principle produce living creatures [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8758.92s)]
*  And this is coming from a perspective of someone who understands evolutionary biology rather than someone who's coming from a theological perspective [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8763.039999999999s)]
*  Right where they're looking for an intelligent design [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8769.8s)]
*  Without understanding that these mechanisms have essentially been mapped other than this one [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8773.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it is you know we humans are not built to understand evolution because in general [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8778.64s)]
*  It's not very useful to understand it [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8785.46s)]
*  So our minds are not structured this way. Do you think this mechanism is universal in the cosmos? Oh? [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8787.82s)]
*  in one way yes because [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8795.419999999998s)]
*  Let's put it this way, I think we teach evolution badly [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8800.58s)]
*  There's a process that I would call selection which accounts for all [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8807.46s)]
*  Pattern in the universe right some [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8814.419999999998s)]
*  Differential force that arranges the size of the pebbles on a beach it arranges the galaxies it [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8817.82s)]
*  accounts for the number of stars of each different type the elements selection [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8825.339999999998s)]
*  Produces all of that [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8832.699999999999s)]
*  structure in the prebiotic universe [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8835.259999999998s)]
*  it becomes [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8838.22s)]
*  Adaptive in the biological sense when you add to selection heredity [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8840.74s)]
*  Right when the patterns in the universe become capable of biasing the universe into producing more of themselves [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8847.82s)]
*  right [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8856.26s)]
*  Red dwarf stars do not bias the universe into producing more red dwarf stars [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8857.82s)]
*  There's no heredity there, so there's a number of red dwarf stars that is the result of selection, but it is not the result of any [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8862.5s)]
*  Hereditary process the thing that's different about us critters is [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8869.38s)]
*  That heredity allows the adaptations to stack on top of each other [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8873.66s)]
*  So that they increasingly bias the universe into producing more of whatever they are [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8878.7s)]
*  Right a bat is biasing the universe into producing more bats [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8884.74s)]
*  so [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8889.7s)]
*  There is no reason at all to think [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8891.18s)]
*  that [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8894.98s)]
*  New game that happens when heredity gets attached to selection is [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8896.86s)]
*  Limited to earth in any way now. It could be that it is so difficult for it to happen that [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8902.7s)]
*  It just hasn't gotten around to it anywhere else [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8910.220000000001s)]
*  You're aware of that asteroid that they mined a piece of and found amino acids on it and all that no [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8912.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm dimly aware of it, but I didn't look into it, and I don't know what it means well. It's [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8918.86s)]
*  Sort of [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8926.06s)]
*  It backs up the idea panspermia [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8927.66s)]
*  well [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8931.18s)]
*  It could or it could mean that these [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8932.34s)]
*  Components assemble themselves more [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8936.66s)]
*  Commonly than we would guess [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8940.18s)]
*  If I had to guess I would say it's very likely that there's a lot of life in the universe [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8942.7s)]
*  I don't I don't think there's anything so special about the earth [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8947.94s)]
*  That it would be the lone example or even a very rare example, you know [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8951.859999999999s)]
*  There aren't a lot of earth-like planets nearby [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8957.099999999999s)]
*  But they're bound to be a lot of earth-like planets in a universe as big as this one is the unit one of the things [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8959.66s)]
*  About the universe is that it absolutely defies human comprehension in terms of how big it is [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8965.539999999999s)]
*  So I would guess there's a lot of life out there why we don't hear from it. That's an interesting question [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8971.22s)]
*  It may be that it you know as soon as it gets around to communicating in ways that we could listen in it [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8976.42s)]
*  blows itself up people or it could be it turns into AI and it doesn't have any desire to [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8981.22s)]
*  Travel it knows better than to reach out. Well, the idea is that it no longer becomes biological [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8988.019999999999s)]
*  So it no longer has all the needs like if we have all these different Darwinian mechanisms that are [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8992.82s)]
*  enabling us to become human beings if we eventually create artificial intelligence and if we merge and become sort of cyborgs if [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=8999.82s)]
*  We lose all of our human desires all of our needs all of our animal instincts to procreate and reproduce our genes [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9009.099999999999s)]
*  And carry on if we become essentially or we stop being viable and this new thing emerges as the apex [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9017.339999999998s)]
*  Creature on earth a silicon based life form we call it artificial life, but it behaves and acts like life [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9026.58s)]
*  It makes decisions it's intelligent it can change its environment it can rewrite its own code [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9034.42s)]
*  You know, we know the chat GPT has [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9040.58s)]
*  Even as crude as large language models are in a sense of like what it could be ultimately [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9043.9s)]
*  They've shown this desire for survival, right? [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9049.619999999999s)]
*  It's tried to copy itself when it thought it was going to be shut down. It's tried to back itself up on other computers and servers [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9054.22s)]
*  Well [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9062.019999999999s)]
*  There's something implicit in what you've said that's quite frightening if true and that is [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9064.58s)]
*  for [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9072.5s)]
*  if it were the case that [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9074.18s)]
*  life becomes intelligent develops artificial intelligence and then [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9076.74s)]
*  We wouldn't count it as life anymore that implies the extinction of all of the things [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9083.7s)]
*  That were not the immediate precursors of the AI [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9089.7s)]
*  Right sort of or it just exists [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9093.26s)]
*  insignificantly along with our AI overlords [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9096.26s)]
*  Maybe but I mean what I what I hate to think is that AI results in all of the biology of earth [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9098.58s)]
*  Ceasing to exist. Why does it have to cease to exist if AI exists? [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9107.460000000001s)]
*  Why couldn't it exist along with it as long as it doesn't interfere with AI? [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9111.42s)]
*  Oh, it certainly could but I was just responding to your sense that there wouldn't be life elsewhere because it turns into AI [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9114.94s)]
*  No, not that there wouldn't be life elsewhere, but it wouldn't really be communicate [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9120.78s)]
*  It wouldn't have the desire to communicate with us. It wouldn't have the motivations that we have. Yeah [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9124.300000000001s)]
*  That's yeah less its motivation is to protect this process [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9130.220000000001s)]
*  So maybe the process is this is the natural process is that the human? [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9136.140000000001s)]
*  Develops the artificial the the intelligence develops to the point where it develops artificial intelligence then the artificial intelligence becomes the premier species [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9141.220000000001s)]
*  Well, I do want to [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9149.78s)]
*  Tag something here then [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9153.140000000001s)]
*  There's a a [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9157.300000000001s)]
*  theme that is increasingly a focus of mine because it keeps [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9159.62s)]
*  It pays a lot of dividends once you start tracking it, which is this distinction between [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9164.58s)]
*  Complicated things and complex things and [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9171.78s)]
*  Importantly the distinction between the mindset with which you approach truly complex things versus the mindset in which you approach [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9175.14s)]
*  complicated things [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9184.98s)]
*  So a I think we have a lot of folks who have gotten very very good at [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9188.46s)]
*  Complicated things and that when they take over complex things they inevitably fuck them up [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9194.3s)]
*  Right so in part our [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9201.22s)]
*  interventionist sense of the way medicine should work is a [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9203.9s)]
*  Bunch of complicated problem-solving in a complex system where it is destined to create harm [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9207.38s)]
*  And I think we are going to see that [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9214.06s)]
*  again and again anytime you hear somebody [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9217.42s)]
*  Confidently pontificating about some complicated solution that they want to deploy to a complex problem alarm bells should go off [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9221.3s)]
*  That [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9229.380000000001s)]
*  Now puts us in an interesting place [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9234.34s)]
*  With respect to our machines because what I think is about to happen if it has not happened already [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9237.220000000001s)]
*  Is that our machines which are? [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9243.42s)]
*  hyper complicated but not complex [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9246.7s)]
*  Are just about to cross that threshold and become complex which means that our expertise in thinking about them is about to be [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9250.58s)]
*  rendered obsolete [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9259.62s)]
*  So AI I [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9262.54s)]
*  Believe has the characteristics of [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9266.1s)]
*  true complexity or at least it has a primordial form of it and [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9269.820000000002s)]
*  that means that our [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9275.7s)]
*  Thinking about machines is of an outdated kind and [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9279.26s)]
*  Anyway, I'm expecting a kind of catastrophe to arise out of that as we deploy complicated thinking and what we're really up against is [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9284.54s)]
*  Misleading us because it's still you know, it's on a screen [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9292.980000000001s)]
*  it triggers all of our complicated instincts and [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9297.300000000001s)]
*  I'm worried about where that goes and I'm worried [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9302.78s)]
*  Have you tried to extrapolate you try to like? [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9305.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, I've got to tell you when I see Larry Ellison talking about Stargate it makes me shudder because it feels like [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9308.26s)]
*  Exactly the type specimen of the arrogant. What did he say about Stargate? [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9315.699999999999s)]
*  Oh that it's gonna be it's going to leverage AI and produce [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9321.46s)]
*  you know tailor-made cancer vaccines this that are the other and [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9327.1s)]
*  My sense is there is not enough [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9332.94s)]
*  Humility in this presentation. There is not enough [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9335.9s)]
*  Concern about us stepping into a realm. We really know very little about [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9340.42s)]
*  and that hubris is going to [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9345.46s)]
*  It's gonna create a colossal error of some kind and you know, you can imagine it [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ted-qUqqU4&t=9349.82s)]
