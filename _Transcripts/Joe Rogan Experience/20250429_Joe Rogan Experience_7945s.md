# Joe Rogan Experience #2312 - Jeremy Renner
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA)
*  What's happening man? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=0.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=14.56s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=15.56s)]
*  Yeah, good to be seen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=16.56s)]
*  Boy, what a journey you've been on. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=17.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=20.96s)]
*  I started listening to your audio book. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=21.96s)]
*  It was giving me anxiety. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=24.28s)]
*  It gets better, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=27.28s)]
*  It takes a minute, but there's a relief for the reader. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=29.24s)]
*  Well the relief is seeing you healthy, walking around. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=32.68s)]
*  The relief is also, you kind of know the end of the story before you go into it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=35.48s)]
*  So then you can really kind of dive into the actual detailed narrative that I put out. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=40.32s)]
*  There's no other way to do it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=46.08s)]
*  But yeah, it's tough for a minute. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  It's like, wow, my sister took a while to read and anybody that was kind of involved [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=49.72s)]
*  in the incident takes a minute. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=53.84s)]
*  It took me a long time to kind of get through it, right? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  It's anxious for me too. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=59.96s)]
*  How long was the actual recovery? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=63.36s)]
*  You don't even walk with a limp. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=65.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=67.28s)]
*  Some things are pretty miraculous. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Some things can be explained and I tried to figure it out as I was writing the book. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=72.36s)]
*  A lot of people ask questions. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=76.2s)]
*  I ask myself questions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=77.8s)]
*  Some things were on my own will. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=80.8s)]
*  Some things were otherworldly of some sort. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=83.08s)]
*  But yeah, I was given, you know, I was supposed to walk with a limp because pretty much a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  lot of titanium and then it was certainly not running and I'm doing far beyond all those [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=91.84s)]
*  things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=96.0s)]
*  I don't know exactly why. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=97.0s)]
*  I can pontificate on why. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=99.16s)]
*  What do you think it was? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=102.8s)]
*  I think it's, will is a really special thing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=103.8s)]
*  The love and fuel to fuel your will I had in spades. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=109.96s)]
*  I feel I could pretty much do anything if I set my mind to it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=117.63999999999999s)]
*  When it was my essential part of my life, my recovery was a 24-hour day job. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=122.36s)]
*  When typically I do many, many other things, right, as we all do in our lives, but when [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=128.16s)]
*  all my focus, like even parenting, was out the window until I can get better. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=131.68s)]
*  So I had to do that first. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=136.84s)]
*  So that being the essential part of every thought, every fiber, every cell in my body [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=139.44s)]
*  was geared towards a one-way street of recovery. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=144.92s)]
*  Well, I'm getting fucking better. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=147.56s)]
*  So I just got better. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=150.84s)]
*  What's the alternative? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=152.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=153.32s)]
*  You know, I was brought back somehow, some way. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=154.32s)]
*  And it would be a disservice to not do all the things I'm supposed to be doing and want [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=159.52s)]
*  to be doing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=166.0s)]
*  So it just took a lot of effort and it looked a lot of support. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=167.26s)]
*  Heck, dude, I mean, there's hundreds of people involved in helping me not die again. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=170.58s)]
*  But then it was, but at the end of the day, the recovery, as you know, you've been injured [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=177.7s)]
*  in some sort of way. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  It's a lonely road. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  It's only you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=186.18s)]
*  No matter how much help you have or PT you have, if your tendons go, whatever the heck [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=187.18s)]
*  happens, you still have to put in the work every day and endure the pain and manage the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=190.86s)]
*  pain and mitigate it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=196.02s)]
*  It can be quite lonely, but I always found that my daughter and my family, I see their [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=198.54s)]
*  faces when I get better, I could stand up, let's say, or not pee in a jar. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=205.82s)]
*  I could get in the wheelchair. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=209.86s)]
*  Any sort of milestone, I'd see their faces get a little bit less horrified, even relieved, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=211.58s)]
*  even quite joyful even. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=216.58s)]
*  So as much damage as I did to my family and their hearts, me getting better can relieve [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=218.22s)]
*  them of that burden. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=226.46s)]
*  So it was an easy one-way road to recover. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=228.3s)]
*  And that's why I recovered fast and I attribute it to my love for my family. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=230.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=235.46s)]
*  So let's bring back to the day of the accident. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=236.46s)]
*  When exactly was it? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=240.66s)]
*  It was New Year's Day. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=242.7s)]
*  New Year's Day, 2023. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=244.74s)]
*  And I host my family at my house up there, like 25 people every post-Christmas to New [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  Year's all the time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  Family, friends, whoever, just kind of come up and we can celebrate the holidays together, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=256.38s)]
*  go skiing, all these type of things. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=260.5s)]
*  But we had a big kind of snowmageddon type snow event that shut down the mountain that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=262.34s)]
*  I live on at the top of Lake Tahoe at about 8,000 feet elevation. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=268.18s)]
*  And we got tons and tons of snow. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=272.34s)]
*  But it happens often, maybe not that intense of a storm. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=274.06s)]
*  But so much so where we were cut off from anywhere else, we were snowed in fine. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=278.14s)]
*  I'm prepared for that stuff. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  Three days without power, prepared for it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=285.17999999999995s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=287.5s)]
*  We can have fun. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=288.5s)]
*  It's actually a relief. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=289.5s)]
*  All the cell phones go off. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=290.5s)]
*  All the iPads go away, computers, and everybody's just playing card games with headlamps on. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=291.5s)]
*  And I mean, it's a riot. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=296.14s)]
*  So we had a good time. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=297.46s)]
*  You know, the food supply was still good. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=299.17999999999995s)]
*  It's New Year's Day and we're getting a break in the weather. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=302.18s)]
*  So I decided I needed to clear the roads and come out for air, essentially. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=304.1s)]
*  And in doing so, that's when the accident sort of transpired. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=308.98s)]
*  It's more of a routine type of thing to have a half-mile-long driveway up there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=313.98s)]
*  And I have to maintain it myself, so I have a snowcat and a bunch of other snow removal [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=318.06s)]
*  type equipment. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=322.1s)]
*  There was a bunch of vehicles, snowmobiles even, things that got stuck in the driveway [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=323.1s)]
*  because it was a lot of extra snow and some of it was very light and then it got very [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=328.58000000000004s)]
*  icy and hard. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=332.26s)]
*  So you're sinking down like three or four feet into it and it was a hot mess. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=333.26s)]
*  So I had to try to dig all that stuff out using the snowcat, pulling this stuff out. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=336.58000000000004s)]
*  This thing, a snowcat, to describe it in words is pretty difficult, but it's like a tank. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=340.86s)]
*  It's probably, I don't know, 12 feet wide. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  The tracks on each side, so it spins like a tank, like a skid steer. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=350.5s)]
*  There it is. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=353.98s)]
*  Yeah, there we go. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=354.98s)]
*  That's a small, tiny version of one. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=356.02000000000004s)]
*  But yeah, it's something kind of like Star Wars, you know? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  But this metal track, it's more like that one right there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=361.22s)]
*  Oh, that one like that? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=365.78000000000003s)]
*  It's exactly like the one I have. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  So it's about like 16,000 pounds or so. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's very nimble on the snow. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=371.02000000000004s)]
*  Just to see it physically, put it back up, to see it physically and to know that that's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=376.02000000000004s)]
*  what ran over your leg? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=380.1s)]
*  Oh, my whole body. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=381.42s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  So you have to step on the tracks, you see, to get into the cab to operate it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=385.58s)]
*  So stepping on the tracks is a normal thing to do. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=390.9s)]
*  You just don't do it while the things, you're operating it, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=393.65999999999997s)]
*  You're in the thing and you drive it, and it's just easy. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=396.5s)]
*  It's a thumb, go forward, reverse, and you're neutral, and that's it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=398.46s)]
*  It's really easy to operate. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=402.73999999999995s)]
*  But it was just, the accident happened because you have to get in and out off on those tracks. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=405.17999999999995s)]
*  And I hit the thumb thing and it threw me off and I was going towards my nephew, so [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=409.86s)]
*  I had to jump back on and try to stop it from killing him because it was going to crush [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=415.02000000000004s)]
*  him between the truck and that big blade that I have. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=418.38s)]
*  But you see that thing? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=421.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=422.1s)]
*  It's a few thousand pounds, that thing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=423.1s)]
*  It's gnarly. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=424.1s)]
*  But so my instinct was to jump back on it and try to stop it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=425.1s)]
*  You know, obviously it didn't work out. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=428.98s)]
*  And it got right over and there you go. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=432.14s)]
*  How much of your body did it run over? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=435.62s)]
*  The entire, all of it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=437.14s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=438.14s)]
*  Because I went, if the tracks were here to jump in the cab, I leaped up and over to try [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=439.41999999999996s)]
*  to grab onto it and got sucked under the whole thing, so the whole length of it just kind [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=444.82s)]
*  of, so there's like a set of wheels that turn these tracks, you see? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=450.09999999999997s)]
*  And there's like six wheels. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=454.97999999999996s)]
*  So it undulates, so I felt all the undulate. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=456.38s)]
*  The first one was the worst, like the pressure and the skull crush and all that stuff. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=459.21999999999997s)]
*  And then it releases because then there's the undulation of the tire and the track. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=463.12s)]
*  And you're awake for that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=468.14s)]
*  By the sixth undulation, just like, all right, all right, just kind of finish already. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=469.14s)]
*  And you're just like, it's like, you know, you're like you're drowning and being struck [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=472.86s)]
*  by lightning and bleeding out. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=479.26s)]
*  All the things all at once, man. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=481.58s)]
*  It's like immense pressure and a movable object. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=483.14s)]
*  And, you know, my skull kind of lost out but still survived. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=486.97999999999996s)]
*  Your skull, run over. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=492.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=494.34s)]
*  It's like, it's like, you know, yeah, it's everything. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=496.22s)]
*  It's like it's 38 broken bones and eyeballs out. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=499.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=502.54s)]
*  And it's a… [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=504.02000000000004s)]
*  Shout out to medical science. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=505.02000000000004s)]
*  I know, right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=506.5s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, all the doctors were like, dude, I don't know how your eye is still [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=508.3s)]
*  operating or still working, but I think because I was on ice, because I did see it, I'm [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=512.22s)]
*  like, well, maybe I'm going to put this eye on ice and just kind of rolled into it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=517.22s)]
*  I saw my eye with my other eye, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=520.7s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm going to keep that thing because I'm on like an icy asphalt driveway [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=525.02s)]
*  that's off of my driveway, right, at the top of the road. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=528.78s)]
*  So it wasn't really great for impact and getting ran over. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=532.38s)]
*  I wish I was on a snowpack. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=535.62s)]
*  It would have been maybe a little bit easier. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=536.62s)]
*  It would push me into snow, right? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=538.3s)]
*  But it wasn't. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=539.78s)]
*  So I just kind of rolled onto it just like maybe I could kind of put the eye on ice until [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=540.78s)]
*  I could figure out how to breathe. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=544.8199999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=546.18s)]
*  You know, I had to sort of laugh at it because it's weird to sort of think about that, you know? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=547.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=554.78s)]
*  So 38 bones? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=557.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=559.78s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, a lot of ribs and all my spiral fracture and my legs, all my joints [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=560.78s)]
*  were broken, all my ankles, my knees, none of my spine. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=566.5799999999999s)]
*  And I only got a laceration of my liver from one of the ribs breaking in a couple spots [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=571.86s)]
*  and I went down and kind of stabbed it, but it didn't really mess it up too bad. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=576.9399999999999s)]
*  So that's okay. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=580.66s)]
*  But all my organs, my brain, I don't think there's any brain damage. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=582.06s)]
*  I'll use that excuse later, I guess. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=590.06s)]
*  Yeah, and my spine, that's the miracle. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=594.86s)]
*  It's like, how did I break 14 ribs, right? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=596.66s)]
*  And I cracked my skull and every arm and leg and finger and thing, but my spine was spared. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=599.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=605.66s)]
*  And all my organs were spared, my brain. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=606.66s)]
*  So like, it's kind of almost no harm, no foul at the end of the day, even though there's [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=608.26s)]
*  probably 20% titanium in my body at this point. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=612.66s)]
*  So how many pieces of titanium were in you? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=617.26s)]
*  Well, the guy that invented this procedure worked at the hospital in Reno because there's [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=620.26s)]
*  a lot of crushing injuries that happen. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=626.06s)]
*  So the ski resorts and mines that are in the area. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=627.46s)]
*  So I got really lucky to get this doctor. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=630.46s)]
*  But it took four doctors to get to this guy. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=633.46s)]
*  So says my family. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=635.66s)]
*  I was out in a coma. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=636.86s)]
*  And once they found this guy, he was on vacation. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=638.26s)]
*  The mayor of Reno actually called him and said, you got to get back and help my friend [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=642.26s)]
*  out. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=645.46s)]
*  And so he rushed out and he's just like, this is what he does for a living. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=646.46s)]
*  He's like, oh, this is easy. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=649.46s)]
*  I can't wait to do this for this guy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=650.46s)]
*  So it relieved all my family, but there was such relief because they were like, oh, he's [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=651.46s)]
*  going to lose his eye when he cut off his leg. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=655.66s)]
*  I mean, all this kind of tragic sort of prognosis, whatever you want to call it, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=657.26s)]
*  So this guy comes in, no, no, it's fine. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=662.26s)]
*  We're going to hammer this thing in. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=663.66s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=664.86s)]
*  Do his face plate. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=665.86s)]
*  Do the thing. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=666.86s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=667.86s)]
*  And just lucky that the orbital bone that broke and the cheekbone that broke, they only [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=668.86s)]
*  wanted to do that because my face as an actor, maybe you want to save my cheekbone, I guess. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=673.26s)]
*  I not that I cared about it, but yeah, he fixed up all my ribs and they use like this [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=679.46s)]
*  mesh and this is sort of weird way to kind of handle. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=685.66s)]
*  If you'd fix one or two of the ribs that are all broken, the rest will kind of fall into [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=689.42s)]
*  place. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=693.4200000000001s)]
*  The body's pretty miraculous. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=694.4200000000001s)]
*  Just give it a little direction and then it heals on itself and it'll grow the bone. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=695.62s)]
*  So it's not as much titanium in my ribs as one might think for all those breaks. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=700.62s)]
*  It's only, you know, it looks like rebar, right? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=705.3s)]
*  You get a scan. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=710.74s)]
*  Like a lot of my body's like, do you have an x-ray of your body? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=711.74s)]
*  Yeah, somewhere. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=715.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, somewhere. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=716.26s)]
*  Is it online anywhere? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=717.26s)]
*  Well, we can see it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=718.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=719.26s)]
*  Do you have it on your phone or anything? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=720.26s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=721.26s)]
*  I could ask my sister for it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=722.26s)]
*  She's got all the... [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=723.26s)]
*  I don't know about anybody. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=724.26s)]
*  It's pretty remedial looking, you know? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=725.26s)]
*  It looks like, you know, like I had a hammer and a two by four and some nails and that's [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=731.86s)]
*  what it just looks like. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=737.54s)]
*  It looks very like, why is there a nail and two screws and, you know, it's Carpentry 101, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=738.54s)]
*  you know? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=745.22s)]
*  There's nothing like, you know, I think the guy that, because I had like screws in my [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=746.3s)]
*  skull and my jaw because that broke in three spots. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=749.3s)]
*  And the guy took it out, it's something that he got from Home Depot. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=753.74s)]
*  It literally is like some, you know, just took it out. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=756.3s)]
*  I'm like, dude, it's squeaking like it's in wood. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=760.66s)]
*  He didn't even numb it or something. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=762.86s)]
*  I almost knocked this guy out. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=765.38s)]
*  It's just like... [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=767.86s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=770.5s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=772.5s)]
*  And I was always kind of half in the bag mentally, just kind of, because it takes so much mental [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=773.5s)]
*  to deal with like pain management and it's emotionally exhausting to deal with like so [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=782.78s)]
*  many different things in your body. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=791.3s)]
*  So I'm always kind of half paying attention to things, you know? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=793.6999999999999s)]
*  It's much sharper mentally now because I don't have to mitigate so much inflammation, pain [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=798.4599999999999s)]
*  and all that all the time. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=804.06s)]
*  So I can kind of be here and laugh with you. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=805.54s)]
*  Back then when this guy was... [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=807.8199999999999s)]
*  I almost knocked this guy so hard, dude. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=809.3399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, glad that was... [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=813.78s)]
*  I was really happy to... [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=815.38s)]
*  It was a great milestone for me to get these screws out of my skull. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=816.38s)]
*  But that was worse than getting ran over by the snowcat, dude. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=821.9s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=826.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=827.5s)]
*  In terms of pain or just discomfort? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=828.5s)]
*  Well, no, it wasn't so much the pain. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=830.5s)]
*  The haunting images of feeling my gums wrap around this screw and it's pulling out. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=833.1s)]
*  It's a lot longer than I thought it was. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=841.6600000000001s)]
*  And then there's three more to go. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=844.1400000000001s)]
*  It was more the... [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=846.62s)]
*  The visual is in my mind kind of what makes it terrible. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=847.9000000000001s)]
*  Because I'm a pretty visual guy. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=852.7s)]
*  So I don't think anything hurts me so much in a physical way. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=856.2600000000001s)]
*  But the visual is a pretty haunting image. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=861.02s)]
*  And the sounds, dude, it vibrates your skull as he's taking it out. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=864.3s)]
*  And it's like... [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=868.22s)]
*  This is what horror films are made of. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=871.22s)]
*  This is like Saw or something. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=874.22s)]
*  Is that the only thing that they had to take out? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=875.98s)]
*  Is the screws that were in your head? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=878.38s)]
*  Or did they take them out of your body as well? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=879.9s)]
*  No, they have to leave those in for the most part because why risk infection and open you [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=881.62s)]
*  up for something? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=885.26s)]
*  But yeah, so all the rest of the stuff stays in until those screws come loose. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=886.82s)]
*  At some point they will. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=894.6600000000001s)]
*  They start backing out, right? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=896.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=897.5400000000001s)]
*  You think you'd put in a locking screw, right? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=898.5400000000001s)]
*  I've had friends that have had broken arms and starts poking out of the bottom. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=901.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=904.98s)]
*  It's what it's doing now. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=905.98s)]
*  And they have to get another operation and get it removed. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=906.98s)]
*  So how many different plates do you have? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=910.34s)]
*  I think I got... [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=914.5s)]
*  There's only a couple in my face and they went in underneath my cheek. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=915.5s)]
*  A plate for my orbital socket and then for the cheekbone. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=918.9799999999999s)]
*  They put I think a plate or two over there to hold that bone in place. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=923.86s)]
*  Do you feel it? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=927.3399999999999s)]
*  I feel the lack of feeling in it. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=931.0999999999999s)]
*  It's still numbness to this whole side because they had to cut all these nerve endings to [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=936.66s)]
*  get in through your mouth. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=942.5799999999999s)]
*  So even the side of my face is slightly a little numb. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=943.74s)]
*  And the rest of them, how much do you feel in all your different bones and joints and [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=950.5s)]
*  all the different things that got repaired? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=957.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's lots of scar tissue to work through all the time. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=959.22s)]
*  What's great is it's not any one spot. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=964.7800000000001s)]
*  It moves around. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=966.9000000000001s)]
*  Even if you're not injured, it's like if you just twist your leg wrong and then it goes [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=969.26s)]
*  up into your hip and then it's in your shoulder, it moves around. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=973.8199999999999s)]
*  Your body kind of moves it around. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=976.02s)]
*  So you just kind of stay on top of it and there's always something to work through in [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=978.74s)]
*  your body. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=983.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=984.3s)]
*  And it's just, look, I already have to do it anyway. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=985.3s)]
*  I'm 54. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=986.58s)]
*  I'm going to have to take care of my health and I just have to make it a very central [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=987.58s)]
*  part of my life. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=991.5s)]
*  And so now do you have full range of motion, full mobility, everything is back to normal? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=992.86s)]
*  I don't know what normal is. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=998.26s)]
*  I feel like I'm maybe 110% just because spiritually and mentally I'm so much better. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1004.26s)]
*  I got so many gifts from dying coming back that yeah, I'm 150%. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1011.7s)]
*  My body will always be, look, my body's aging so I have to fight against age. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1017.42s)]
*  Well, recovery is age reversing. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1021.98s)]
*  It's the same stuff that people are doing just to reverse age. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1024.8s)]
*  I just do it just because it's my recovery and I have to for the rest of my life just [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1027.78s)]
*  to prevent inflammation and discomfort and swelling, things like that. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1031.86s)]
*  So when you have so many broken bones and so many broken joints, what is the recovery [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1036.42s)]
*  like? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1042.18s)]
*  Like how do they even get you moving again? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1043.18s)]
*  Day by day. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1045.78s)]
*  Day by day. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1046.78s)]
*  Yeah, as soon as I got home from the hospital, yeah, PT there and working to just move, keep [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1047.78s)]
*  things moving. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1057.14s)]
*  You have to. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1058.14s)]
*  Otherwise you lose it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1059.14s)]
*  You'll lock up or you lose it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1060.14s)]
*  Because seeing you walk around today in the studio, I would have no idea. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1061.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1064.5400000000002s)]
*  You look totally normal. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1065.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1066.94s)]
*  It's great. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1067.94s)]
*  It takes a lot of work and it's still working. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1068.94s)]
*  I was having to stretch in your studio. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1071.22s)]
*  I have to move quite a bit so I don't lock up. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1073.5s)]
*  After a good night's sleep, it's like, eh, you could be a little stiff in the morning [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1078.46s)]
*  and I have to do some stretches and things like that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1082.0600000000002s)]
*  I think if I didn't get in the accident in 54, I'd probably have to do it anyway. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1084.82s)]
*  So it feels good to have to force the stretching, I think. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1088.6599999999999s)]

*  And so just day by day, so you're completely bedridden initially. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1171.12s)]
*  And how long does it take before you can sit up? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1176.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1179.44s)]
*  It's pretty, it moves pretty quick. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1182.9199999999998s)]
*  Randomly with the punctured lung and all this broke, the shoulder, the collarbone dislocation, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1186.3999999999999s)]
*  all this stuff. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1190.52s)]
*  That healed pretty quickly. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1192.12s)]
*  But that doesn't require gravity and force onto your legs. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1194.44s)]
*  Your legs have to take. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1199.2s)]
*  So that took a little bit longer. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1200.2s)]
*  The legs, both ankles, those are under trauma and plates and those. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1201.68s)]
*  This is all a pipe, essentially. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1207.44s)]
*  These are rebar, my whole lower leg. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1209.44s)]
*  So that took a little bit longer. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1212.0400000000002s)]
*  But the ribs, ironically, it was only painful for I feel like a couple weeks. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1213.72s)]
*  I also had these plastic suitcases for my lungs because they had a little bleed out [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1218.0400000000002s)]
*  and this stuff was going in. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1222.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know what goop was in that thing, but I had to carry those things around for a while. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1224.32s)]
*  Once I got rid of those, I was kind of sitting up a bit more. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1228.8s)]
*  And I felt good once I was kind of sitting up. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1231.68s)]
*  But there's still, as you can imagine, so much trauma, so many places. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1235.92s)]
*  But I think the longest it was was really getting up to to stand up, to walk, to get all your joints, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1239.96s)]
*  to work properly again, to relearn to walk, relearn to move, because you really kind of have to. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1247.16s)]
*  A lot of atrophy, as you can imagine, that happens. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1252.68s)]
*  But I was standing up and moving around. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1254.76s)]
*  I got into a chair probably by February after like three weeks. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1259.84s)]
*  Wow. And the more I can move, the faster you heal. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1264.76s)]
*  You get more blood flow. You're getting your body to work better. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1268.84s)]
*  Help with my attitude and will to get out and sit up. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1273.44s)]
*  You know, all the things. Each of these things are like milestones. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1277.56s)]
*  And I would just like, yeah, and then move forward to the next thing. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1279.64s)]
*  And set a goal for myself, even if it was just like to sit up and like turn. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1282.2s)]
*  Or I didn't have to set such big to reach too far to keep my confidence high. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1286.8400000000001s)]
*  So because I keep reaching these goals and just kept going and going and going. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1292.48s)]
*  And I find myself again, it's 24 hours a day. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1295.3600000000001s)]
*  So what do I have to do today? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1298.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, I have to ask. It's going to get better. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1299.76s)]
*  And, you know, it just kept going. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1302.3600000000001s)]
*  And whatever thing. And there's so many things to attack to get better. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1304.4s)]
*  It's like I never got bored. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1308.04s)]
*  I always had all these bands and stuff. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1309.68s)]
*  I was in a wheelchair and I'd wrap it around like this desk. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1311.36s)]
*  And I'd be like a leg press, you know, all these like interesting ways. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1314.4399999999998s)]
*  Just like to try to strengthen my my body and get better. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1318.4399999999998s)]
*  Whatever wasn't, you know, anything that would work, I would do it. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1322.1599999999999s)]
*  I say no to nothing. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1326.4399999999998s)]
*  Say yes to everything. And let's try it. Let's do it. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1327.4799999999998s)]
*  Took it took in everything, took in everything. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1331.6s)]
*  You know, they say that is one of the more difficult things with stroke victims [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1334.1999999999998s)]
*  is the will to do the exercises to force yourself to recover. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1339.24s)]
*  Yeah, because so many people just they they have never done that before. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1345.28s)]
*  They've never pushed themselves before. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1349.5600000000002s)]
*  They don't. And they there's this tendency to just kind of give up. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1351.68s)]
*  Some people. Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1355.44s)]
*  That's it's part of the reason why I wrote the book is maybe people [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1357.48s)]
*  because it's a lonely place when people are struggling in in recovery [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1360.16s)]
*  and when it's a lifetime recovery, too, you know, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1364.04s)]
*  I hope they can find something they can grab on to. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1367.1999999999998s)]
*  Like this guy can get overcome this. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1370.32s)]
*  I can get out of my own way here and maybe not. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1371.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe think of it differently. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1375.52s)]
*  The only thing we have control of ever in life and perpetuity is our perspective. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1377.32s)]
*  So, you know, what's my I could easily just go be victimized and, you know, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1382.32s)]
*  cry about it and I got my career is over and it's not it's not even part of [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1387.8s)]
*  the narrative part of it's not even in the conversation. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1392.28s)]
*  It's like I'm getting better every day for the rest of my life. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1394.76s)]
*  That's it. Wow. There's only one way to go. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1398.2s)]
*  What's the alternative, Joe? Right. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1401.56s)]
*  What is the alternative? I keep saying that to my what's the alternative? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1403.16s)]
*  I'm not going to stumble around through life. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1405.96s)]
*  I wasn't brought back here just to suffer. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1408.8s)]
*  That's not happening. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1411.52s)]
*  I'd say unplug the machine. I'm done. I'm out of here. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1412.88s)]
*  It's way better being dead. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1415.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? I'm not going to come back and just waddle [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1416.76s)]
*  and limp my way through life. It's not going to happen. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1420.52s)]
*  What's crazy is you if you didn't approach it like that, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1422.88s)]
*  you probably wouldn't be able to walk. Correct. Correct. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1425.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because there have been a lot of people that have been gravely injured [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1428.3200000000002s)]
*  that never come back. Yeah. Yeah. You have to push it right. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1431.64s)]
*  Anything that's in your life or excellence, you have to obsess at it [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1434.8s)]
*  and risk everything for it. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1440.1200000000001s)]
*  You have to or it's not going to happen. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1442.6000000000001s)]
*  No one's going to do it for you. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1444.76s)]
*  But what else are you going to do? Yeah. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1446.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, I mean, again, like I said, what's the alternative? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1449.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this sucks. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1451.32s)]
*  But like so is a cold plunge. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1452.2s)]
*  And so does this. And so does that. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1453.9199999999998s)]
*  So does that. You got to really test. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1455.04s)]
*  We got to test our bodies, our limits to really have real growth, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1456.96s)]
*  and especially in recovery. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1460.6s)]
*  You have to. What else are you going to do, man? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1462.12s)]
*  You're going to take pills. Right. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1464.24s)]
*  That was one. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1466.36s)]
*  Again, one of the harder things worse than the accident as well [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1467.0s)]
*  is getting off oxycontin. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1469.76s)]
*  And I got off pretty quickly. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1471.6s)]
*  And that's gnarly stuff, man. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1472.84s)]
*  I'm glad it was there for, you know, the pain for me. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1474.84s)]
*  But like I wanted to get off it as soon as possible. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1479.24s)]
*  So because it's highly, highly addictive. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1481.24s)]
*  And coming off that stuff is gnarly. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1483.56s)]
*  It's so hard. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1485.92s)]
*  And you have a really strong will. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1486.88s)]
*  And some people don't. I know. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1489.28s)]
*  Put all people on that. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1490.8s)]
*  That's crazy, dude. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1492.72s)]
*  Yeah. It is really ironically, I was supposed to be doing [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1494.2s)]
*  a a a movie about the Sackler family. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1497.32s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1502.52s)]
*  But it was supposed to happen like literally that that April or just that that spring. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1505.92s)]
*  Obviously, that got canceled because I had to take oxycontin [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1510.68s)]
*  kind of get by. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1514.76s)]
*  But then to get off that stuff real quick, you know, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1516.16s)]
*  it was really interesting to help people treated that drug. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1518.48s)]
*  You know, everyone was like, it was monitoring, counting the pills. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1522.0s)]
*  It was a half a thing like this. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1524.64s)]
*  At that, everyone was on it like, dude, what you treat me like some sort of drug. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1525.92s)]
*  I don't give me this stuff. I don't want it. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1530.3600000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ, it's terrible. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1532.04s)]
*  But it's a pretty powerful, powerful stuff. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1534.24s)]
*  And I don't I don't ever blame sort of the drug. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1536.84s)]
*  I just think sort of how maybe it's it's free to use. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1539.12s)]
*  And it's it's even supported in school systems. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1542.9599999999998s)]
*  And, you know, they got that family kind of got away with a lot of stuff [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1545.32s)]
*  to promote that. To put it mildly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1548.36s)]
*  It's a whole new. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1551.56s)]
*  You've seen Peter Berg's thing on Netflix, Painkiller. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1552.56s)]
*  We've seen that. It's a docu drama documentary. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1556.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1559.9599999999998s)]
*  Matthew Broderick. Yeah. Yeah. It's gnarly, man. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1561.76s)]
*  Gnarly. Yeah. That's an evil family. Yeah. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1564.4799999999998s)]
*  What they did to people and just support the idea that, you know, hey, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1567.52s)]
*  you could just be on this and you don't have any pain. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1572.64s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1574.72s)]
*  And it's not even addictive. Yeah. Just. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1575.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's the knowing it's the knowing part. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1578.84s)]
*  And then, yeah, then double downing and selling and getting it really [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1580.56s)]
*  getting it out there and promoting it. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1584.08s)]
*  Yeah. It's a thing that you could be on forever. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1585.88s)]
*  Yeah. Which is just insane. Yeah. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1588.28s)]
*  So you're on it. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1590.96s)]
*  And how long did you have to be on it for? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1592.48s)]
*  I get always working to to get off of it. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1595.24s)]
*  And I think maybe. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1599.24s)]
*  It was around five got home on January 13th, Friday the 13th. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1602.0s)]
*  And I think it was probably less than a month, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1609.3600000000001s)]
*  probably like beginning of February, because I had all my molars [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1613.24s)]
*  and stuff got pushed in. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1617.1200000000001s)]
*  So my mouth's a hot mess, my jaw is broken. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1618.48s)]
*  And but I'd have night terrors, as you would. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1621.0s)]
*  Being awake through that trauma. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1624.84s)]
*  So and I bit down in the tooth is in just in a certain spot [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1626.6s)]
*  and just cracked my molar and it goes down to the nerve and that. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1629.52s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I feel that pain. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1633.9599999999998s)]
*  But I'm on all this oxy cotton. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1635.9599999999998s)]
*  I don't feel maybe I don't need to be on that set. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1637.4399999999998s)]
*  So I had to go get that emergency extraction [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1641.48s)]
*  and get a post put in on my back more. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1643.8799999999999s)]
*  And I said, well, I'm going to I'll take it one more. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1646.52s)]
*  Time just for the tooth pain or whatever, even with the dentist gave me. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1649.48s)]
*  I think I took the dentist stuff, whatever that was. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1653.84s)]
*  And cold turkey off oxy cotton and Gabby Pinton. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1656.76s)]
*  Cold turkey. Yeah, I didn't know. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1661.0s)]
*  You didn't know how hard it would be. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1664.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, no. I would just so adamant. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1666.28s)]
*  I don't really listen to the doctors. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1670.6s)]
*  I don't listen to the doctors. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1673.12s)]
*  Yeah. So yeah, so I started crying [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1675.9199999999998s)]
*  for about three and a half days straight, even during my PT. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1678.8s)]
*  I'm just like not that I'm sad, but like full crocodile tears, tears, tears. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1682.4s)]
*  24 hours a day. Right. Just going. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1687.8000000000002s)]
*  I couldn't stop crying. And I was shivering. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1690.52s)]
*  So this is all just withdrawal. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1694.2800000000002s)]
*  Withdrawal. Yeah. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1695.48s)]
*  I wasn't thinking that anything other than like, why am I crying? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1696.2800000000002s)]
*  I didn't know is withdrawal. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1699.96s)]
*  Even because my mind's not there. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1702.0400000000002s)]
*  I'm in my mind's in recovery and getting off this stuff and focusing on [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1703.8400000000001s)]
*  holding my body up. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1710.2800000000002s)]
*  It takes just a lot of mental acuity to just exist. Right. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1711.84s)]
*  So I wasn't thinking that. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1715.72s)]
*  Of course, I look back on it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1717.0s)]
*  Of course, I'm coming off the fucking heroin. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1718.56s)]
*  It's like, right. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1720.48s)]
*  So yeah. And then so I call my sister and thing. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1723.12s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know why I'm crying. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1726.44s)]
*  I can't stop crying. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1727.56s)]
*  She was. Let's call it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1728.6399999999999s)]
*  Had these different doctors that we'd zoom call with when I was at home. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1730.0s)]
*  And so we called the pain management doctor. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1734.36s)]
*  And she's like, look, it's all of music. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1736.36s)]
*  What are you doing? You got a taper off that. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1738.44s)]
*  It takes like two weeks, at least. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1739.92s)]
*  You can't just cold turkey. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1741.8400000000001s)]
*  Gabby, it's no wonder you're feeling all cold and all this stuff, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1742.8400000000001s)]
*  because that's all nerve stuff. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1745.68s)]
*  So I started feeling gravity. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1747.1200000000001s)]
*  I started feeling temperature. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1749.68s)]
*  I started feeling everything was like on fire. Right. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1751.2s)]
*  So why did you make the decision to go cold turkey? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1755.3600000000001s)]
*  Because I didn't want I didn't. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1759.0s)]
*  I don't like the feeling of being on pain meds. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1760.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't like, you know, I want to have my mind. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1762.72s)]
*  I mean, I was always using humor to find my sobriety. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1765.48s)]
*  If I could land a joke, it means I'm reading the room [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1768.76s)]
*  and I'm hitting the timing right to whatever it is. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1771.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, right. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1773.6s)]
*  So I wanted my I needed my mind. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1774.4799999999998s)]
*  And I need my wit. I needed my will to to recover. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1777.32s)]
*  I needed sleep and I needed my brain. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1780.52s)]
*  And the drugs kind of numb my brain as they would. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1782.76s)]
*  Right. And you know, I'm your whole body. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1786.84s)]
*  So I just wanted off of them. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1788.6799999999998s)]
*  And I don't like how I feel. You feel muddy. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1789.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And I just didn't like the feeling. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1793.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, it came with a price, but I got the OK to like [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1796.52s)]
*  take a little fiber of oxy to sleep on if you needed [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1800.76s)]
*  to mitigate some pain just so I could sleep. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1803.84s)]
*  I'm like, OK, maybe I'll do that if it happens. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1805.44s)]
*  And I did once or twice or three times, maybe after that moment. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1808.32s)]
*  But I got through it and I got off it. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1811.28s)]
*  But I got off it because I cracked that tooth and that I felt pain. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1814.08s)]
*  Like that is like that's not going to let me sleep at all. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1818.12s)]
*  It's a heartbeat in my brain. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1820.8s)]
*  My face is just like throbbing, right, as you would. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1822.84s)]
*  For anybody. So I said, like, oh, that's then I don't need to take the pain meds. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1826.04s)]
*  So make those my excuse to get off the pain meds. Right. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1829.76s)]
*  Because thankfully feeling pain and you're on the pain. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1832.04s)]
*  Yeah. I would have been on that shit much longer if I didn't crack that tooth. Wow. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1834.0s)]
*  Because I wouldn't have the will or say, like, oh, let's get off this stuff. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1838.68s)]
*  Right. But it took that. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1842.32s)]
*  I'm like, OK, well, I don't need it. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1843.76s)]
*  I had knee surgery in 93 and they gave me something. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1845.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't it was either Percocet or Vicodin. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1849.92s)]
*  I don't know what it was. And I took it one time. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1851.92s)]
*  And I felt so bad. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1854.8799999999999s)]
*  I felt so stupid. Yeah. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1856.9599999999998s)]
*  I remember being in my apartment in New York, just feeling so dumb [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1858.8799999999999s)]
*  and just thinking I'd rather be in pain. Yeah. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1861.9599999999998s)]
*  And so one day I took it one day and I'm like, that's it. I'm done. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1864.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And then I sold it. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1867.9599999999998s)]
*  I sold my pills to this guy, Jeff, at the pool hall. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1869.24s)]
*  It's a dirt bag. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1873.4799999999998s)]
*  It was this dirt bag guy that I used to hang out with at the pool hall. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1874.1999999999998s)]
*  He had a bandana and long hair. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1877.6799999999998s)]
*  He was a hippie. He always sold drugs. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1879.4799999999998s)]
*  And I sold them to him. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1881.84s)]
*  He's like, I'll take it. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1885.36s)]
*  What do you? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1886.28s)]
*  What do you got? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1887.1599999999999s)]
*  And then I had surgery again. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1887.8s)]
*  I've had a bunch of different surgeries for jujitsu injuries, martial arts. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1890.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1894.6799999999998s)]
*  Second time I had surgery on my knee, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1895.8799999999999s)]
*  I had a knee reconstruction again on my other knee in 2003. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1898.7199999999998s)]
*  I didn't dig anything. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1902.8s)]
*  I'm just I just like I don't want nothing. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1904.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to just deal with it. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1906.08s)]
*  And it was OK. Yeah. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1907.56s)]
*  Maybe anti-inflammatory or something. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1909.3999999999999s)]
*  And it's really I didn't even take that stuff. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1911.32s)]
*  Because I don't think that's good for you either. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1914.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1915.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's you're going to be in pain no matter what. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1916.9199999999998s)]
*  It's just going to dull it a little bit. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1921.28s)]
*  I'd rather feel it all. I agree. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1923.08s)]
*  I agree. Acustom to deal with it. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1925.2s)]
*  Yeah. That was like back when I even when I had my wisdom teeth pulled out [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1928.12s)]
*  when I was like 20 or something, you know, that's pretty gnarly surgery. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1932.2s)]
*  Right. And they give you like it was a codeine or something. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1936.08s)]
*  You know, I just puked on that and said, no way. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1938.96s)]
*  Took one pill and I never took didn't sell to anybody. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1941.72s)]
*  Isn't it astonishing that some people like it? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1944.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. It's people party on it and they'll go drinking like to Vicodin. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1946.72s)]
*  Oh, it's I just it's just the opposite for me. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1950.16s)]
*  I just can't. It's just my body doesn't agree with it. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1952.64s)]
*  Yeah. I just and I'm glad I don't I don't like it. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1954.88s)]
*  I had a friend of mine who was a musician and he would write all his music on [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1958.96s)]
*  on Vicodin's. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1963.2s)]
*  I was like, what? How do you do that, man? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1964.6000000000001s)]
*  Like I took it, whatever it was that I took. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1967.48s)]
*  I can't remember which one it was. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1969.88s)]
*  But I felt like a moron. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1971.6s)]
*  I just felt like I had like 20 percent of my brain. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1973.8s)]
*  Yeah. And it was just this dull, like wet cotton stuffed in my head. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1976.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, I guess maybe it's just like different biology. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1981.52s)]
*  Maybe different people react to it differently. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1985.28s)]
*  For sure. Yeah. It wasn't for me. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1987.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1989.9599999999998s)]
*  So how long did it take for the withdrawal to subside? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1991.12s)]
*  By the time I got to the [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1995.8799999999999s)]
*  that zoom with the the the pain management doctor, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=1998.76s)]
*  he said, like, well, don't do that. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2003.44s)]
*  You should tape her up like, well, I'm already off it now. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2004.88s)]
*  I'm like, I've come off the crying train, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2007.3600000000001s)]
*  especially because he also made sense of it for me. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2012.28s)]
*  It's like says, come on. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2014.68s)]
*  It's like it's like day four. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2015.48s)]
*  By the time I talked to him and [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2016.88s)]
*  it just helped me make sense of like why I was feeling the way I was feeling, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2020.04s)]
*  because it felt like a setback. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2023.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. You know, and because there are setbacks in recovery, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2026.28s)]
*  but this felt like a real setback. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2029.0s)]
*  Like I like I couldn't grab of why. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2030.36s)]
*  And I'm pretty in tune with like my body and my emotions and my everything. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2033.8s)]
*  And I just couldn't grab why I was when it's so obvious. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2038.04s)]
*  But then, you know, I don't I'm not the one really administering this stuff. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2045.1599999999999s)]
*  My mom just give me the pill and doing peptide injections for me and, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2048.0s)]
*  you know, rebirthing me, you know, taking care of me. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2051.36s)]
*  So peptides were on. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2054.48s)]
*  Oh, man. If I look back, I don't know. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2056.2400000000002s)]
*  I was getting three three ML, so three loads, and they're all mixed up. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2058.8s)]
*  So as you would [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2063.08s)]
*  probably say a lot of the same ones that I'm on now that I continue [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2066.6s)]
*  and I rotate in and out of different ones for BBC one, five, seven, five. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2069.12s)]
*  It's like a time is in. Yeah. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2073.12s)]
*  All those. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2074.52s)]
*  AOD and MOTC and I have to do a lot of blood work. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2075.84s)]
*  Just got my hemoglobin was at two. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2079.52s)]
*  Whoa. Yeah. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2082.4s)]
*  That was what it was going back to work. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2083.96s)]
*  Back to Mayor Kingstown. Crazy. Yeah. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2086.32s)]
*  It's like the blood of a dead man, essentially. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2090.2400000000002s)]
*  I just got no energy. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2091.76s)]
*  So then I started really working with [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2092.88s)]
*  all my blood panels, big, giant, wide 16 vial blood panels. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2096.6s)]
*  And that started to be my new course of recovery [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2100.52s)]
*  of a cellular way, but in a blood way. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2106.76s)]
*  And that's where I really started to get strong. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2108.7200000000003s)]
*  I was moving around, I was mobile. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2112.04s)]
*  All the bones are healed by this time. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2114.0s)]
*  It's like a year's gone by. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2115.48s)]
*  But now I started working on cellular and blood health. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2116.44s)]
*  And that's when I that's when I got to like my skin started to look great. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2118.92s)]
*  And, you know, because your blood is tells you what your body's producing [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2123.08s)]
*  and not producing. Right. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2126.2000000000003s)]
*  So that was a great report card or barometer of where I was at, why I'm not, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2127.48s)]
*  you know, where my mitochondrial levels are at, anything was that. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2133.1600000000003s)]
*  So it was really, really great part of my recovery. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2136.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's what I'll continue to still continue to do today. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2139.88s)]
*  Boxing's biggest weekend is here. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2142.1600000000003s)]

*  Dot co slash audio. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2232.2000000000003s)]
*  Did you use a hyperbaric chamber? Oh, yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2233.6800000000003s)]
*  That must have helped. Yeah. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2236.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. What it did for me, it's not something I don't think there's many things [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2237.6800000000003s)]
*  in my recovery that you do that feel good. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2241.08s)]
*  It just doesn't make you feel as shitty. Right. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2244.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like you're building a mountain one layer of pain at a time. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2247.8s)]
*  Yeah. So hyperbaric is great. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2251.8s)]
*  It helps with lactic acid when you're working out, as you know, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2254.0s)]
*  all the oxygen you put in your body is a great necessity. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2256.56s)]
*  It's again, those things that are even age reversing. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2260.48s)]
*  It's also disease preventative. Right. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2263.44s)]
*  It's amazing. And I got one that was [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2266.0s)]
*  you can sit in and do multiple things. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2269.72s)]
*  I can't just sit there for an hour and a half in the chamber and like, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2271.44s)]
*  I'll go crazy. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2276.36s)]
*  I have a busy brain, you know, and so I get a computer or whatever, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2277.8s)]
*  email, whatever I can do to kind of continue to do it, to make it a part of my life. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2280.88s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. Yeah. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2284.56s)]
*  And then I go into like a red light bed, a high powered red light infrared bed. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2285.48s)]
*  Then it moves all that oxygen through my body even more so [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2289.2s)]
*  and gets deeper into the tissue. Amazing. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I use both of those things. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2294.68s)]
*  Yeah. Those are just parts of my life. Yeah. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2296.04s)]
*  But I would imagine for something like what you went through, it's imperative. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2298.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. For tissue recovery and oh, man, huge, huge, huge. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2302.12s)]
*  Faster for repair. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2306.44s)]
*  And so from so a year later, you're walking around. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2307.88s)]
*  Yeah. Well, yeah, I was walking by my daughter's birthday was March 28th. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2312.3599999999997s)]
*  So I guess a few months later I was walking, but there was assisted, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2317.64s)]
*  very assisted week walking with Kane or a walker. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2322.2s)]
*  So that had to be amazing. Yeah. Yeah. And then. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2325.92s)]
*  I was like, but the summertime, I stopped doing recovery. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2330.24s)]
*  The intense 24 hour day of recovery, I would do like a 12 hour day recovery [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2334.04s)]
*  and then go walk in the sand in Lake Tahoe. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2337.72s)]
*  Lake Tahoe is the world's biggest coal plunge. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2340.1600000000003s)]
*  It's a freezing as lake. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2342.28s)]
*  So I just go dip my legs in that lake, walk in the sand. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2343.6800000000003s)]
*  It's great for instability in your ankles, your joints, your hips. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2346.32s)]
*  And I would just do that kind of stuff. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2349.7200000000003s)]
*  Even ride a jet ski. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2351.56s)]
*  I was riding a jet ski in June. Wow. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2352.84s)]
*  Yeah. Taking it easy and not doing nuts, but just like, you know, just live in life. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2355.32s)]
*  You know how good that is for your mental acuity, your spirit, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2359.28s)]
*  your emotional body and all that stuff. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2362.52s)]
*  So I was out in the sunshine getting vitamin D. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2364.8s)]
*  I was in nature. I was with friends. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2367.2000000000003s)]
*  I could do life stuff like I'm back in life stuff, you know. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2369.56s)]
*  Now, that's a great confidence builder. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2374.12s)]
*  So I kept trying to do those things. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2376.44s)]
*  And then, of course, I have to go back into all the recovery stuff. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2377.88s)]
*  And, you know, that I always do, but. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2381.12s)]
*  It's happy I can do it. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2384.68s)]
*  What is the cold water feel like with like, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2386.0s)]
*  I mean, you have a rod through your your tibia. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2389.36s)]
*  Yeah, the cold water is that's not the issue. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2392.24s)]
*  It's when it's cold weather. Yeah. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2394.36s)]
*  Like anybody, it's your it's your stiffer. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2397.08s)]
*  Your your blood slows and all that stuff. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2399.9199999999996s)]
*  So it doesn't help us. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2402.08s)]
*  I need circulation in my joints. Tendons don't get a lot of blood flow. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2403.08s)]
*  I really got to work at getting blood flow in these joints. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2406.7999999999997s)]
*  Otherwise, they'll stiffen and I'm just slower going. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2410.8799999999997s)]
*  It's everything just feels a little bit more robotic. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2414.52s)]
*  What did they have? But I think that's it before injury. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2417.3199999999997s)]
*  It's that for anybody. Right. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2419.4399999999996s)]
*  Also, elevation, I mean, eight thousand feet elevation in Tahoe. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2420.68s)]
*  So all the things aren't really kind of helping to my recovery, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2423.68s)]
*  but my body will respond in those oxygen depleted environments [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2426.8799999999997s)]
*  and all that stuff. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2431.52s)]
*  So maybe it did help. Maybe it didn't. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2432.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2434.04s)]
*  But I did most of my initial recovery in L.A. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2434.96s)]
*  And then when I could, I got out to Tahoe to be in my sort of happy place [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2437.56s)]
*  and in nature. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2442.08s)]
*  Did they have to reconstruct your knees? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2442.96s)]
*  Did you know? No, none of that. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2445.12s)]
*  They they there's cracks in my ankles and my foot [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2447.68s)]
*  spun around a handful of times a spiral fracture of my leg. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2452.12s)]
*  So they had to hit a rod down into my knee and they had to screw it, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2456.36s)]
*  screw it, you know, the plates and all that stuff. So. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2460.52s)]
*  I didn't sure I just move those things. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2463.96s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2465.48s)]
*  There's not wasn't full like reconstruction, like people get a new knee or a new hip. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2465.88s)]
*  It was just a lot of breaks. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2470.36s)]
*  My pelvic broke, broken three spots, my hips, you know, but you don't fix that. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2471.52s)]
*  You even said you broke your asshole. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2476.0s)]
*  I'm like, is that what you say as a doctor? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2477.96s)]
*  Is that how you say it? Come on. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2480.04s)]
*  I think there's another word for it. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2481.96s)]
*  I think he was trying to make me laugh and I did. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2491.8s)]
*  And Eric makes you laugh. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2495.44s)]
*  I think you broke everything, Jeremy, even broke your ass. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2497.32s)]
*  I'm like, all right. That's wow. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2499.56s)]
*  Wow. And so what? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2502.16s)]
*  So you've gone through the 12 hour. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2505.52s)]
*  Now you're in like this 12 hour. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2509.0s)]
*  Yeah. So that's summertime. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2510.68s)]
*  Yeah. So I got to do like. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2512.24s)]
*  Just life stuff, and that was that was that was really my first shot at. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2515.2s)]
*  Allowing myself to think that there is a future [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2521.3999999999996s)]
*  and I'm not going to live a life of full time recovery for the rest of my life. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2524.9199999999996s)]
*  So I can actually go do it some other things that I enjoy doing [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2529.2799999999997s)]
*  with people in kind of a normal way. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2532.56s)]
*  So I was without a cane, without anything by the time by June and summer came around. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2535.3599999999997s)]
*  So I'm moving around. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2539.56s)]
*  That's pretty moving around with with, you know, inflammation [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2541.44s)]
*  and getting downstairs very slowly. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2544.24s)]
*  But as you would, as long as you're patient, as I was as aggressive, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2546.2s)]
*  if I was with my recovery, I allowed patients to also live within [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2550.52s)]
*  that aggressive attack on each joint or each inflammation, whatever it was. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2554.44s)]
*  I do allow patients and because I allow myself to push hard, hard, hard, hard. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2559.12s)]
*  I listen to my body. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2564.56s)]
*  But I says, fuck off. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2565.48s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I'll chill out for a second. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2566.36s)]
*  And then, you know, keep going. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2568.64s)]
*  So but I got to live life. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2570.36s)]
*  And that was so, so rewarding to. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2572.16s)]
*  My spirit and my my my confidence, which, you know, you need in that [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2576.16s)]
*  and that kind of those kind of dire times and I keep going. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2580.08s)]
*  And then, like I said, when we got to back, getting back to work, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2583.2799999999997s)]
*  because I got so ready. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2585.92s)]
*  Maybe I'm down to like four hours a day of recovery by the end of that first year. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2589.04s)]
*  I'm like, I'm go back to work. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2592.72s)]
*  I need to get back out into the world and use [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2594.2s)]
*  life as my recovery and still only spend four hours a day on [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2597.88s)]
*  hyperbaric chamber, red light, whatever the heck I could do to. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2602.7200000000003s)]
*  I mix it all up. It's a bunch of different stuff. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2606.0400000000004s)]
*  A lot of heat, a lot of vibration power plate stuff. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2608.6800000000003s)]
*  That was really great for numbing the nerve endings. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2611.6800000000003s)]
*  My back of my knees, back of my ankles, that kind of stuff. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2614.52s)]
*  I don't know if you ever used that stuff for. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2617.7200000000003s)]
*  No. What do you what are you doing? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2619.0s)]
*  I used to have this thing. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2620.6400000000003s)]
*  God, what was it called? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2622.28s)]
*  It was a thing you stand on. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2623.6000000000004s)]
*  It's like it would shake you. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2625.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Vibrations. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2626.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2627.52s)]
*  It would slow it down. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2630.16s)]
*  They would make it fast. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2631.28s)]
*  Yep. It's like that. Yeah. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2632.16s)]
*  And that really was great for numbing, like the back of my knees, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2633.48s)]
*  that really still ache and back of my ankles, just so it's not quite so sensitive. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2636.8s)]
*  I don't know if it floods the nerve endings with blood or whatever that does, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2642.88s)]
*  but it just kind of numbs it out and I can go to sleep on. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2645.88s)]
*  It's great. It's beautiful. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2648.6s)]
*  I used to have one of those at my house in L.A. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2649.6s)]
*  I don't even remember what it's called now. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2651.32s)]
*  it was just some machine, it had a bunch of different programs. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2653.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's power plate. It's probably a power plate. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2656.16s)]
*  Well, power plate, I think, is the one that you work out on. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2658.16s)]
*  You can, yeah, yeah. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2660.66s)]
*  This one was a little different. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2662.16s)]
*  This one was just, it would just shake you at a bunch of different frequencies. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2663.66s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2667.66s)]
*  You would stand on it, and it was supposed to just do a bunch of stuff [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2668.66s)]
*  for your hormones and endocrine system and all sorts of different stuff, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2674.16s)]
*  just by the vibration. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2678.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it helps me a lot. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2680.16s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2683.16s)]
*  For sure. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2684.16s)]
*  And are you doing sauna and stuff like that as well? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2685.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I usually use just the red light bed. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2688.66s)]
*  It's sweat, it's shaped like a coffin or a chanting bed one. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2692.16s)]
*  It's just as effective, I think, as you're going to the sauna. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2697.66s)]
*  It doesn't take so long to heat up or anything. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2701.16s)]
*  You just get in that thing and cook. It's amazing. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2703.66s)]
*  And it's amazing that even an LED light like that or infrared light [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2706.66s)]
*  can warm you up so much, but it's intense. I love it. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2710.66s)]
*  And then after a while, do you start lifting weights? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2713.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I started training as soon as I got the, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2716.16s)]
*  when I started doing blood work, because my hormone, my testosterone was at 200. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2720.66s)]
*  My hemoglobin was at 2. Everything was... [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2725.16s)]
*  Your body's just wrecked. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2728.16s)]
*  Oh, wrecked. And I'm going back to work. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2729.16s)]
*  So I had to attack while I was falling asleep during workouts [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2732.16s)]
*  that I'm trying to do or whatever. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2736.16s)]
*  They only scheduled me maybe six hours a day on set, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2738.66s)]
*  because I fell asleep in the middle of a scene. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2741.66s)]
*  They're like, who's going to wake that fucker up? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2744.66s)]
*  So I had to really work on that. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2750.66s)]
*  Once I got, I think it was really the testosterone, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2752.66s)]
*  once I got that level to like 700, 800 constantly, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2755.66s)]
*  then I had more energy. And that allowed me more energy in the gym. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2759.66s)]
*  And once I had that, that got me more energy. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2762.66s)]
*  So I just started feeding upon itself. I was doing blood panels every week. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2764.66s)]
*  And I just saw progress, progress, progress. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2769.16s)]
*  And then I just started lifting and I had so much energy. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2772.16s)]
*  And I felt better the more I lifted and moved and stretched. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2775.66s)]
*  And it just kept compiling, just like most things in life. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2778.66s)]
*  And it got easier, like most things. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2782.16s)]
*  With oxygen chamber, that's better when you compile on it. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2784.16s)]
*  Same with red light stuff. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2787.16s)]
*  Nothing, no one time at anything is going to do anything. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2788.66s)]
*  But if you do it often enough and make it a central part of your life, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2791.66s)]
*  it's like, oh, I was on fire. It's great. I started running. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2794.16s)]
*  You can run now. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2796.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Wow. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2798.16s)]
*  For distance? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2799.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know where I'm running to. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2801.16s)]
*  I was never a distance guy. I was always a sprinter, right? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2803.16s)]
*  I was a sprinter from high school and college. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2805.66s)]
*  Does it hurt when you run? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2810.66s)]
*  It feels like, if you're, if you've ever been in a car, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2812.66s)]
*  you're on the freeway and it has a misalignment or it's shaky, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2819.16s)]
*  or you've got a flat tire. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2823.16s)]
*  It feels like I've got four flat tires when I'm running. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2824.66s)]
*  It looks great. It looks like, oh, this guy's no problem with this guy. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2827.16s)]
*  Just boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2830.16s)]
*  And it feels like the wheels are going to fall off. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2831.66s)]
*  Wow. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2834.16s)]
*  Mentally or something. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2835.16s)]
*  It just feels like it's, because it's like, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2836.16s)]
*  it's a lot of pressure to put on all these joints, right? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2839.16s)]
*  I haven't sprinted really much in a while. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2844.66s)]
*  I haven't really worked on that. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2847.66s)]
*  I've been working on other things, you know, blood and cells [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2849.16s)]
*  and that kind of stuff. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2852.66s)]
*  So, I mean, sprinting is not, you know, what am I doing? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2854.16s)]
*  What am I going to do? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2856.66s)]
*  Sprint? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2857.66s)]
*  54, for God's sakes. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2858.66s)]
*  Maybe like for, you know, like, because you do stunts in movies [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2860.66s)]
*  and maybe at some point I'll have to sprint. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2864.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2867.66s)]
*  Or maybe not. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2868.66s)]
*  Maybe just don't do that shit, you know? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2869.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, maybe you can though. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2871.66s)]
*  I mean, I think you can. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2873.66s)]
*  I already have. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2875.66s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2876.66s)]
*  I just don't know if I want to make that a central part of, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2877.66s)]
*  you know, the acting experience. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2879.66s)]
*  Well, that would be an absolutely phenomenal turnaround [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2881.66s)]
*  to go from where you were to going back to action films. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2885.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, to go play Hawkeye or something. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2888.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2890.66s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be a good test. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2891.66s)]
*  Or born identity. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2892.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's tough. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2893.66s)]
*  That would be a tough one. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2894.66s)]
*  That was in excellent shape for that one. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2895.66s)]
*  That would be a challenge. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2898.66s)]
*  Yeah, I would imagine. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2900.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2902.66s)]
*  Do I want to tax my body? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2903.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2904.66s)]
*  Probably should. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2905.66s)]
*  Is it taxing your body or is it strengthening your body? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2906.66s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2908.66s)]
*  This is the question. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2909.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2910.66s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2911.66s)]
*  How many miles can you get on this stuff, right? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2912.66s)]
*  That titanium. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2914.66s)]
*  I think it's forever. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2915.66s)]
*  I think it's permanent. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2917.66s)]
*  I mean, everything you have just reinforces the recovery of the bones, right? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2919.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2923.66s)]
*  And then you just have a plate there that just keeps the bones in order. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2925.66s)]
*  Yep. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2929.66s)]
*  And it's essentially... [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2930.66s)]
*  All the titanium in my body is useless at this point. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2931.66s)]
*  It did its job, and the bone's grown. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2934.66s)]
*  So it just stays there now. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2937.66s)]
*  Is there an argument that the titanium hinders you at all? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2939.66s)]
*  Well, I mean, it is foreign metal in your body. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2943.66s)]
*  It's not rejecting it, but there is a point where it could. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2948.66s)]
*  You know, just like allergies, you don't get allergies sometimes for 40 years in your life, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2953.66s)]
*  and all of a sudden, I'm allergic to down. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2958.66s)]
*  It could reject it. Who knows? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2959.66s)]
*  You never know. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2961.66s)]
*  I'll cross that bridge. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2962.66s)]
*  I'm worrying about today. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2965.66s)]
*  I'm here with you. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2966.66s)]
*  I'll worry about that shit later. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2967.66s)]
*  It's just so impressive. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2968.66s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2970.66s)]
*  It really is amazing. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2971.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2972.66s)]
*  Because at any other time in history, you're dead. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2973.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2976.66s)]
*  Any other time in history. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2977.66s)]
*  20 years ago, you're dead. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2978.66s)]
*  Goner. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2979.66s)]
*  You're a goner. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2980.66s)]
*  20 years ago. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2981.66s)]
*  It's insane, right? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2982.66s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2983.66s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2984.66s)]
*  What a great blessing to have all those people that... [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2985.66s)]
*  Even the EMTs and all the people that were there, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2988.66s)]
*  the life-saving stuff that did all this stuff that they had to do, man. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2990.66s)]
*  There's so much... [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2993.66s)]
*  I'm really known in that community, especially in the EMTs [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2994.66s)]
*  and all that sort of stuff. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2998.66s)]
*  I have a lot of firefighter friends and all that stuff. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=2999.66s)]
*  So it's just like a... [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3001.66s)]
*  You're just getting a little extra juice and love from these people. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3002.66s)]
*  I knew one of my best friends is a firefighter in that area, Jesse, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3006.66s)]
*  and he's just retired. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3012.66s)]
*  He got the phone call from his buddy who had to stab my chest [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3013.66s)]
*  and release the pressure from the lung and dah, dah, dah, on the ice. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3017.66s)]
*  And he's the one that says, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3020.66s)]
*  Look, dude, Jesse, Jeremy, we did the best we could, dude. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3021.66s)]
*  You want to get to the hospital? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3025.66s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3027.66s)]
*  And that's code for like... [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3028.66s)]
*  He might be gone. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3029.66s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3030.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3031.66s)]
*  But they were like... [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3032.66s)]
*  I talked to them all later. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3035.66s)]
*  I saw every nurse. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3036.66s)]
*  I saw every doctor. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3037.66s)]
*  I went by every ENT, even the pilot that flew me up there. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3038.66s)]
*  Just had to give everyone the biggest squeeze [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3042.66s)]
*  and apologize if I was a pain in the ass or whatever it was, man. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3044.66s)]
*  It's that... [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3048.66s)]
*  Reminds me of just why I'm back anyway [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3050.66s)]
*  and the only thing that you take with you is love, man. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3052.66s)]
*  That's it. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3055.66s)]
*  The beginning of the audio book is your daughter. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3056.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3058.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3059.66s)]
*  That was the one I had the hardest time with. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3060.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3063.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3064.66s)]
*  Because it's... [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3065.66s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3066.66s)]
*  Yeah, I can't imagine. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3067.66s)]
*  Dude. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3069.66s)]
*  Does this... [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3074.66s)]
*  Does this... [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3076.66s)]
*  I mean, it must forever change your perspective on life [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3077.66s)]
*  because you've crossed back. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3080.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3082.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3083.66s)]
*  Well, it just made it easier. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3084.66s)]
*  It's ripped away all the white noise, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3086.66s)]
*  things I gave credence to, things I gave value to. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3089.66s)]
*  It's fucking meaningless. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3092.66s)]
*  Bullshit. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3093.66s)]
*  Bullshit. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3094.66s)]
*  All the bullshit. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3095.66s)]
*  Bullshit is gone. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3096.66s)]
*  And I just don't... [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3097.66s)]
*  Sadly, I mean... [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3098.66s)]
*  Spinning rock, you know, people and capitalism and stuff, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3101.66s)]
*  it's things I just don't... [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3104.66s)]
*  I feel like I belong, but I do. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3106.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3109.66s)]
*  A lot of times I just don't feel like I fit into... [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3110.66s)]
*  a certain... [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3116.66s)]
*  how things work or seem to work down here. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3117.66s)]
*  Or, yeah, I just don't do things I don't give value to. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3120.66s)]
*  I only do things that are valuable in my life. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3125.66s)]
*  That's it. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3127.66s)]
*  That is it. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3128.66s)]
*  I do nothing else. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3129.66s)]
*  It's amazing how much time and energy people put into things [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3130.66s)]
*  that ultimately at the end of the life, they're not valuable. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3133.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3136.66s)]
*  They don't mean anything. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3137.66s)]
*  And they occupy most of your thinking. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3138.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3140.66s)]
*  Or even your time, or your career. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3141.66s)]
*  Right? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3143.66s)]
*  People do careers that they fucking hate. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3144.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3146.66s)]
*  Whether they're in a marriage, they fucking despise, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3147.66s)]
*  all this stuff is spending too much time doing what? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3149.66s)]
*  Why? Why? Why? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3152.66s)]
*  Because of fear. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3154.66s)]
*  Because of fear, you get trapped, and it's too difficult to get out. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3155.66s)]
*  They get too deep and buried into some place. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3158.66s)]
*  They paint themselves on a corner. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3161.66s)]
*  It's quite sad. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3163.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3164.66s)]
*  You know? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3165.66s)]
*  It is sad. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3167.66s)]
*  But it's also... [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3168.66s)]
*  I mean, there's an amazing example that you can shine to the rest of the world [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3171.66s)]
*  that maybe people don't have to go through what you went through to realize [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3177.66s)]
*  that most of what you're thinking about all day, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3183.66s)]
*  especially if you're one of those people that's wrapped up in social media, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3186.66s)]
*  most of the things you're thinking about all day are just nonsense. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3189.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3192.66s)]
*  Just total nonsense that's stealing your life. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3193.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3196.66s)]
*  I mean, one of the reasons why I wrote the book is I hope there's things that I learned [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3197.66s)]
*  and the gifts that I received from passing and coming back and overcoming huge obstacles. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3202.66s)]
*  And a lot of people can identify with suffering and struggle. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3207.66s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a physical struggle. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3212.66s)]
*  But it's a certain way to think and perspective to work your way through it [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3214.66s)]
*  because it is a lonely place. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3218.66s)]
*  And I think there's something beautiful about the narrative of an author to a reader [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3221.66s)]
*  or even just audio, which is even more intense because you get the 911 call [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3224.66s)]
*  and it's kind of dramatic in that sense, but it's pretty intimate. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3228.66s)]
*  And I think you can really move the needle for somebody. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3232.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3236.66s)]
*  The more open and honest and vulnerable I am in sharing the narrative, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3237.66s)]
*  the maybe more I have a chance at connecting with the reader or listener. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3241.66s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3245.66s)]
*  You know? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3246.66s)]
*  The thing is about when you're in the middle of a struggle, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3247.66s)]
*  it never seems like you're going to get out of it. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3250.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3252.66s)]
*  And you're trapped. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3253.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3254.66s)]
*  You feel it. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3255.66s)]
*  And it's so difficult for people to trust the process or to trust that it will get better. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3256.66s)]
*  And this is, unfortunately, why a lot of people end their lives [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3261.66s)]
*  because they do not think it's going to get better. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3264.66s)]
*  And you hear it from so many people that almost took their life [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3267.66s)]
*  or failed when they tried to take their life and now realize, oh my God, I was so wrong. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3271.66s)]
*  It does get better. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3276.66s)]
*  I am better. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3277.66s)]
*  Everything's better. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3278.66s)]
*  And I just didn't see the light. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3279.66s)]
*  I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3281.66s)]
*  I thought there was just nothing but this feeling that I couldn't endure. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3283.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3287.66s)]
*  That hopelessness? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3288.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3289.66s)]
*  That weighs heavy, doesn't it? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3290.66s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3292.66s)]
*  You can't afford that. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3294.66s)]
*  You can't give that power. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3296.66s)]
*  You can't give that power. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3298.66s)]
*  No. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3299.66s)]
*  You can't. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3300.66s)]
*  I think anybody can sink into that, right? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3301.66s)]
*  Anybody can sink into that. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3303.66s)]
*  Anybody can sink into that. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3304.66s)]
*  It's just so hard for people that have never gone through something before. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3305.66s)]
*  If your life has been really easy and then all of a sudden you're tasked with one of the most difficult burdens ever, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3308.66s)]
*  overcoming the fear and the feeling of wanting to end life because you can't take it. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3315.66s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3324.66s)]
*  I mean, Jesus. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3325.66s)]
*  Look, I think people need to suffer. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3328.66s)]
*  It is an actual requirement of life. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3333.66s)]
*  It is the fiber, the DNA of love. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3336.66s)]
*  Real love and true love and perpetuity can't exist without suffering. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3339.66s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3347.66s)]
*  But you don't appreciate it. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3348.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3349.66s)]
*  You have to have suffering. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3350.66s)]
*  And suffering doesn't have to be looked at in a negative thing. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3351.66s)]
*  It could be looked at as a beautiful thing. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3354.66s)]
*  It's where real love comes out of. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3356.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3358.66s)]
*  You know, all my suffering, there was real love in there. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3359.66s)]
*  Everyone around me just in this recovery or in a loss I may have had from an uncle or a grandparent or whatever, you know, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3363.66s)]
*  there's real love that comes in that suffering, you know, even though it can be a lonely experience. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3371.66s)]
*  I mean, I look at it that way and not as a negative, terrible thing because it's just temporary. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3376.66s)]
*  And it's counterintuitive, though. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3382.66s)]
*  What's that? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3384.66s)]
*  It's counterintuitive. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3385.66s)]
*  In a negative term of it, right? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3386.66s)]
*  But we all have to suffer, right? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3387.66s)]
*  I mean, it's part of the human experience. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3389.66s)]
*  It's the Joe Rogan experience. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3391.66s)]
*  I'm not suffering. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3396.66s)]
*  I'm having a great time with you. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3397.66s)]
*  But, you know, I don't think people welcome that or allow that to happen in their lives and let it be OK that the suffering [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3399.66s)]
*  that we suffer, like the hard times are the building blocks to who we are. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3405.66s)]
*  It builds resilience. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3410.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3411.66s)]
*  It builds character. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3412.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3413.66s)]
*  It builds all those things. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3414.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3415.66s)]
*  I remember one time, I mean, this is a minor suffering in comparison, but one time I went on this hunting trip on Prince of Wales Island, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3416.66s)]
*  which rains like 350 days a year. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3421.66s)]
*  And so we were up there for a week just getting drenched. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3425.66s)]
*  And, you know, you're camping, so you're in a tent and you think, oh, well, I'll be dry in the tent. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3428.66s)]
*  You're not dry in the tent. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3433.66s)]
*  There's no dry. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3434.66s)]
*  There's no such thing as dry. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3435.66s)]
*  I remember I turned my headlamp on in the tent once because I had a pee and I was going to step out of the tent to go to the bathroom in the rain. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3436.66s)]
*  And when I pressed the headlamp inside my tent, all I saw inside the tent was water vapor. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3443.66s)]
*  It was just filled with moisture. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3451.66s)]
*  There was just water, like droplets all flying around inside the tent. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3453.66s)]
*  I'm like, oh, my God, you're never going to be dry. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3459.66s)]
*  There's no dry. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3462.66s)]
*  And, you know, it was just miserable, but fun. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3463.66s)]
*  I was with good friends. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3466.66s)]
*  We had a good time. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3467.66s)]
*  Then I came back to L.A. a week later. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3468.66s)]
*  And I remember I called my friend Steve Rinell. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3472.66s)]
*  I called because he's the one who took me on the trip. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3474.66s)]
*  And I said, dude, it's sunny out and I've never appreciated the sun like this before. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3476.66s)]
*  I'm at a level of happiness that I don't think I've ever felt before. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3481.66s)]
*  I'm just sitting outside with my eyes closed, just taking the sun. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3486.66s)]
*  It was wonderful. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3489.66s)]
*  L.A. is always sunny. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3491.66s)]
*  You get so used to it. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3493.66s)]
*  It's like you're a trust fund kid, you know, like who can't appreciate money because you've always had it. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3494.66s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything to you. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3500.66s)]
*  But now all of a sudden going just being drenched for seven days and being in that sun, I was like, oh, and then it made me realize like, oh, you need to suffer. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3502.66s)]
*  You need to suffer. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3511.66s)]
*  You're never going to appreciate this life. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3512.66s)]
*  And either you voluntarily suffer or you will suffer involuntarily because life, regular life will make you suffer. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3514.66s)]
*  Yeah, very true. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3521.66s)]
*  It's that's not it seems sort of anti-human to want to do something to make yourself suffer. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3523.66s)]
*  Right. It doesn't seem very sort of characteristics of you always want to take the fastest route to get somewhere. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3528.66s)]
*  You know, it's just innate in kind of human nature to to do that. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3534.66s)]
*  Sadly, and it doesn't. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3538.66s)]
*  And that that leads to a life of complacency and mediocrity. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3540.66s)]
*  Well, if you look at life today and if you look at society today, we have unprecedented levels of depression and unprecedented levels of anxiety and unhappiness. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3544.66s)]
*  Yet it's probably the safest time ever. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3555.66s)]
*  And it's probably the easiest time ever. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3559.66s)]
*  It's so easy that poor people are fat. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3561.66s)]
*  That's how easy it is. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3564.66s)]
*  Like that's never been the case all throughout history. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3566.66s)]
*  Poor people were starving and poor people are fat now. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3569.66s)]
*  Like that's how easy it is to live just to exist. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3573.66s)]
*  So, I mean, that's not saying that being poor is easy. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3577.66s)]
*  Certainly not. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3580.66s)]
*  Certainly a struggle. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3581.66s)]
*  But it's way easier than starving to death. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3582.66s)]
*  Like this is like an unprecedented easy time. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3585.66s)]
*  And because of that and because there's this narrative that people have to constantly seek comfort, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3588.66s)]
*  to seek vacation and relaxation and retirement and all that bullshit. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3594.66s)]
*  And so that's in your head. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3600.66s)]
*  And there's this softness to existence. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3602.66s)]
*  And so everything that comes your way is overwhelming. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3605.66s)]
*  Somebody said this once and it's like a great quote that I remember. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3609.66s)]
*  The worst thing that's ever happened to you is the worst thing that's ever happened to you, regardless of how small that is. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3612.66s)]
*  So if the worst thing that's ever happened to you is like, I remember my girlfriend broke up with me when I was 18. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3619.66s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I couldn't believe it. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3625.66s)]
*  I thought I was going to be with her forever. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3627.66s)]
*  I was so sad. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3629.66s)]
*  And then I think back, oh my God, that was the best thing that ever happened. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3630.66s)]
*  She was a nightmare. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3633.66s)]
*  But back then I thought, I was probably a nightmare too. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3634.66s)]
*  But back then I thought like life was over. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3638.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3641.66s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3642.66s)]
*  But you have to get through that in order to appreciate life, to really appreciate life. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3643.66s)]
*  We have this bizarre narrative in our head that you shouldn't suffer. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3647.66s)]
*  I know. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3652.66s)]
*  Where does that come from? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3653.66s)]
*  I can't. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3654.66s)]
*  Well, because it used to be so difficult to live. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3655.66s)]
*  And so you would try to find a time where it wasn't difficult. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3657.66s)]
*  And so then it became the thing that everybody focused on. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3662.66s)]
*  Focused on chilling, relaxing. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3664.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3666.66s)]
*  And the people that I know that don't do anything and don't take any chances and don't take any risks and don't exercise and just seek comfort are the most miserable angst. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3667.66s)]
*  The most miserable anxiety ridden people I know. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3676.66s)]
*  Well, that's yeah. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3679.66s)]
*  They're dead inside. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3680.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3681.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3682.66s)]
*  That's complacency. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3683.66s)]
*  And it's that's the definition of complacency. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3684.66s)]
*  But again, it's counterintuitive. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3685.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3686.66s)]
*  Because you think comfort is easy, is relaxing. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3687.66s)]
*  It's nice. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3689.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3690.66s)]
*  But it's only relaxing if you've earned it. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3691.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3692.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3693.66s)]
*  Correct. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3694.66s)]
*  You've got to get through something in order to appreciate just chilling on the couch. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3695.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3697.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3698.66s)]
*  So that's why I always do. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3699.66s)]
*  I have to fight my I have to trick my own behavior into doing things I don't want to do all the time. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3700.66s)]
*  If I don't want to do it, I'm like, oh, I'm going to do it. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3707.66s)]
*  Don't even think about it. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3709.66s)]
*  Just go do it. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3710.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3711.66s)]
*  Because I know the lazy mind just wants to like, oh, yeah, let me just let me skip the gym today or let me not do PT today or whatever the heck it is. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3712.66s)]
*  I don't want to get poked and prodded. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3719.66s)]
*  No, just do it. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3721.66s)]
*  Just go do it. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3723.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3724.66s)]
*  The thing you don't want to do is the thing you probably should be doing. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3725.66s)]
*  Almost always. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3726.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3727.66s)]
*  And that's why I pretty much always just do that. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3728.66s)]
*  It gets me out of my way, out of complacency, just like laziness. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3730.66s)]
*  It doesn't exist because I do the opposite of what I want to do. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3735.66s)]
*  That's why you're happy. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3739.66s)]
*  And that's why I'm so full of joy, dude. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3740.66s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3742.66s)]
*  I've never been happier, more connected to humans, more connected to my daughter, more connected to myself, more centered in my spirit where I am right now, where I'll go, where I'll be, where I always am and always have been. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3744.66s)]
*  It's beautiful, man. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3757.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3759.66s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3760.66s)]
*  You got to conquer your inner bitch. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3761.66s)]
*  You do, man. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3763.66s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3764.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3765.66s)]
*  There's an inner bitch inside of everyone that's like, no, let's just do nothing. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3766.66s)]
*  You got to go shut the fuck up. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3770.66s)]
*  You have to have like two minds. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3772.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3774.66s)]
*  Well, you got to surround yourself with others too that can inspire you too. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3775.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3778.66s)]
*  So then you do things as even as you and I go work out, do something, it's a lot easier than going to the gym by yourself. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3779.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3784.66s)]
*  Because we are social creatures. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3785.66s)]
*  So let's do things that like I'm doing, like I'm building a whole rehab recovery center at my house. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3787.66s)]
*  Like, well, maybe I can open this to the public and make make this a communal cool thing so everyone has access to this stuff. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3794.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3800.66s)]
*  I'm still considering doing that. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3801.66s)]
*  But like just make it a place to be and hang so it's everyone can do it. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3802.66s)]
*  And it's not just me. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3808.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3809.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3810.66s)]
*  Separating myself from other people, whatever it might be in my life. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3811.66s)]
*  I try to find ways to make it a communal thing. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3814.66s)]
*  So it just makes it easier to to continue this in perpetuity. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3817.66s)]
*  That's another counterintuitive thing. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3821.66s)]
*  It's like you have to understand how important community is. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3823.66s)]
*  It's like a vitamin. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3825.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3826.66s)]
*  Big time. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3827.66s)]
*  It really is. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3828.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3829.66s)]
*  Well, that's a shared experience too that comes with that negative or positive in the tent with your friends. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3830.66s)]
*  And if you're alone and doing that, it's you have no one to share that misery with. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3834.66s)]
*  But at least you did share that experience with somebody like, dude, I never thought I loved the sun so much. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3838.66s)]
*  Remember, we were fucking eating ass, sucking on the rainwater in that tent. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3843.66s)]
*  You know, but it's even a negative experience can be. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3847.66s)]
*  But it's shared. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3849.66s)]
*  It's still quite beautiful. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3850.66s)]
*  And it's a it's a map, a milestone, a part of your life that uses barometer to change your or appreciate the sun more or whatever it might be. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3852.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3860.66s)]
*  So those shared experiences, I think, were invaluable. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3861.66s)]
*  It's the only thing I chase in my life is that for people that ever want to start a fire when it's everything's wet, Fritos. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3863.66s)]
*  You know, little Fritos, bags of Fritos. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3872.66s)]
*  Yeah, those motherfuckers are so toxic that if you light those things, they're like little fire starters. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3875.66s)]
*  No way. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3881.66s)]
*  Man, Fritos are crazy flammable. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3882.66s)]
*  They stay lit for a long ass time because they're just soaked with oil. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3885.66s)]
*  Oil. Yeah. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3889.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3890.66s)]
*  Whatever oil, whatever horrible fucking oil, whatever industrial lubricant those fucking things are made out of. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3891.66s)]
*  But when you light that, they're essentially some sort of a corn byproduct and oil. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3897.66s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3901.66s)]
*  And so if you light those fuckers on fire and then you get some semi dry sticks and light them, light those. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3902.66s)]
*  And we started one fire one day because one day it didn't rain. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3909.66s)]
*  So that one day it didn't rain. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3913.66s)]
*  Me and my friend Brian Callan, we were determined to start a fire. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3914.66s)]
*  And so we just found like the driest possible. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3917.66s)]
*  Nothing was dry, but dry as possible sticks and twigs and started it and then dried some logs out. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3920.66s)]
*  And it was they were hissing and steam was coming off them as we were lighting it. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3926.66s)]
*  But Fritos. Yeah. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3930.66s)]
*  Fritos are an amazing fire starter. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3932.66s)]
*  Kind of crazy. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3934.66s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3935.66s)]
*  Makes you think about eating though. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3936.66s)]
*  What am I going to say? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3938.66s)]
*  You guys about to eat this shit? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3939.66s)]
*  Which brings me to another question. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3941.66s)]
*  Like how much did you alter your diet after all this? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3943.66s)]
*  Because you have to imagine like anything that causes inflammation, it then becomes an issue. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3946.66s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't go down so much that I was eating pretty good. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3950.66s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3955.66s)]
*  It didn't go into like things that I haven't gone into that even yet to like, oh, what causes inflammation? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3957.66s)]
*  What am I eating that does that? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3963.66s)]
*  I haven't really gotten that far into it yet. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3965.66s)]
*  I'm still I'm sure I will. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3968.66s)]
*  But or there was a doctor also helped me stuff and I have people cook, prepare some certain things for me. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3970.66s)]
*  But I don't couldn't tell you what causes inflammation that I put in my mouth. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3975.66s)]
*  I mean, maybe if I have wine probably does. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3979.66s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3983.66s)]
*  Alcohol does for sure. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3984.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3985.66s)]
*  But again, I don't do I really am good at moderating all things, all things good and bad. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3987.66s)]
*  So my body has a chance to sort of exist and it's not forced to any supplements, too many peptides, too many to anything. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=3995.66s)]
*  All good stuff. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4003.66s)]
*  I sort of moderate. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4004.66s)]
*  So once I got my blood right, because I was like 205 pounds, I'd never been more than a buck sixty five. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4005.66s)]
*  And it's just all this surgery weight and all this stuff. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4013.66s)]
*  And it's hard to get off when you have a year. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4016.66s)]
*  Your hemoglobin is too. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4018.66s)]
*  I just had new energy. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4020.66s)]
*  So also you probably have to eat a lot, too, because your body needs calories in order to help that. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4021.66s)]
*  And the proteins, too. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4027.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4029.66s)]
*  And also it's difficult to eat because again, my molars got pushed in. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4030.66s)]
*  It's hard to chew. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4032.66s)]
*  I look fine. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4033.66s)]
*  But to chew on a steak and asparagus thing, it's like this tough. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4034.66s)]
*  It's tough for me to get through. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4038.66s)]
*  Still to this day? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4039.66s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be forever. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4040.66s)]
*  I can't fix it. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4041.66s)]
*  If I start to move those molars again, they'll probably fall out. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4042.66s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4046.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4047.66s)]
*  And I'd rather keep them and just be uncomfortable. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4048.66s)]
*  So they just they got pushed in. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4051.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4053.66s)]
*  This side. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4054.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4055.66s)]
*  It's usually sort of like just like an arc to your thing. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4056.66s)]
*  So my bite just kind of arcs and then goes straight back. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4057.66s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4060.66s)]
*  I got pushed in and broke broke the jaw three times here. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4061.66s)]
*  So and then just breaking the jaw doesn't ever really heal right. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4063.66s)]
*  So biting down is quite it's annoying. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4068.66s)]
*  It's full chaos on my mouth. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4071.66s)]
*  But I don't bitch about it. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4072.66s)]
*  I just sort of accept what it is. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4073.66s)]
*  And it could have been so much worse. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4075.66s)]
*  Could have been so much. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4077.66s)]
*  I have all my teeth. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4078.66s)]
*  I have a smile. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4079.66s)]
*  It's great. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4080.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4081.66s)]
*  You know, I feel great. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4082.66s)]
*  And I walk in and breathe in. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4083.66s)]
*  I have love and joy in my life. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4084.66s)]
*  So, you know, who cares about what happens in my mouth, man? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4085.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4088.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4089.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4090.66s)]
*  No, that's it's it's really kind of an amazing story. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4091.66s)]
*  And it's it's just amazing how these stories can be so inspirational for other people, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4093.66s)]
*  too, which is why I'm really glad you wrote your book, because these stories, they're [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4099.66s)]
*  they're like autobiographies, especially of people that you admire, that you've seen [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4103.66s)]
*  movies before. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4107.66s)]
*  It's like those those struggles, they're so real. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4108.66s)]
*  And when someone's going through something themselves and they can turn to your book, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4112.66s)]
*  it can give them a lot. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4116.66s)]
*  It's fuel for people. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4118.66s)]
*  It really is. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4119.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4120.66s)]
*  It for me as well. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4121.66s)]
*  I mean, I'm so I resisted writing it because I still don't know how or why it can and will [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4122.66s)]
*  inspire people. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4127.22s)]
*  I can only make assumptions. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4128.22s)]
*  And I think it's so particular to the actual reader and the person. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4130.0199999999995s)]
*  But so I can never sort of pontificate on how or why it's important or not. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4132.78s)]
*  But it is like there's an achievement for me to get through it word by word. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4137.26s)]
*  That didn't want to do to relive it. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4143.46s)]
*  And then because it's in my body. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4146.22s)]
*  I talk about it all the time. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4147.9s)]
*  It is it is a part of my narrative as part of my life is just recovery is just it's just [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4149.26s)]
*  my life. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4154.42s)]
*  And I love it. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4155.42s)]
*  I enjoy it. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4156.42s)]
*  I feel better. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4157.42s)]
*  I look better and all that stuff. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4158.42s)]
*  But it's like the book now is a tangible sort of this is this is a great dialogue that we'll [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4159.42s)]
*  have as long as we want. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4164.18s)]
*  But it's just a dialogue that exists. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4165.74s)]
*  But now this is a tangible object with words. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4168.38s)]
*  The words don't change. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4170.42s)]
*  They stay there like a tablet. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4171.42s)]
*  And something kind of interesting about that is like a milestone or a tangible thing that [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4173.58s)]
*  now it exists in the world. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4177.34s)]
*  And psychologically that says a lot to me. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4180.42s)]
*  So like even when I do die, that's still there. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4183.18s)]
*  So maybe it can help somebody even when I can't be there to talk with them or whatever [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4186.14s)]
*  it might be or even exist. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4191.42s)]
*  Something exists long. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4193.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty interesting because I do movies and things like that or [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4194.14s)]
*  music. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4197.820000000001s)]
*  Those are like the same thing as a conversation. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4198.820000000001s)]
*  They just sort of exist in the moment. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4200.42s)]
*  Like, you know, it's great going to a concert, but then it's over. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4201.900000000001s)]
*  And then that's it. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4205.900000000001s)]
*  What happened? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4207.54s)]
*  Well, I could tell you about the concert, but something about something existing beyond [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4208.54s)]
*  your life is something pretty interesting. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4213.099999999999s)]
*  What was the process like of writing? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4215.139999999999s)]
*  Did you physically sit down and write things? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4216.82s)]
*  Did you initially? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4219.0199999999995s)]
*  Initially, I have a ghostwriter who helped me because I've never written a book. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4220.0199999999995s)]
*  I've written a lot, but I've never written a book. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4225.94s)]
*  So I wanted to get the format right. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4228.62s)]
*  And so we would work through this format. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4231.139999999999s)]
*  So almost like an outline. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4232.78s)]
*  And then so we just do interview by each of the sections of this outline that we put [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4233.86s)]
*  out. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4238.0199999999995s)]
*  And so then we would just talk like this and they told us, talk about this and take me [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4239.0199999999995s)]
*  moment by moment in the accident. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4242.5s)]
*  I'm like, all right, let's do that. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4244.58s)]
*  And we meet every day for like two, three hours, however long I could sustain going [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4246.5s)]
*  word by word on it. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4251.62s)]
*  And we recorded all the things and I would write on my own because it would kick up new [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4253.299999999999s)]
*  memories and start writing about the Lamaze thing. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4256.179999999999s)]
*  And oh, gosh, that came up. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4258.98s)]
*  And then that became a whole chapter in the book about breathing, my awareness to breathing [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4260.18s)]
*  and how it became so important in my life. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4266.3s)]
*  Anyway, so I just kept going and writing and writing and writing. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4269.14s)]
*  And then I would do talks to companies. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4272.06s)]
*  I would speak to kids at schools. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4274.700000000001s)]
*  All this is part of the writing experience because you can ask me the same question and [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4276.740000000001s)]
*  then but we're in this environment. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4280.54s)]
*  But then if I'm with my family and I tell the same answer the same question, it's a [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4282.5s)]
*  different, it's the same kind of answer, but different. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4287.06s)]
*  So I kept learning more and more data and information was stored in my brain and my [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4290.18s)]
*  heart and my spirit and had to unearth it and put it down into words, which is which [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4294.740000000001s)]
*  I found to be the most difficult thing. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4300.9800000000005s)]
*  Because as we speak, like I'm doing now, it's free to speak as whatever you want. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4302.780000000001s)]
*  But to write down the words, oh, wait, there's accountability to the words because they're [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4307.660000000001s)]
*  written and you didn't have more. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4311.46s)]
*  You have more word choice. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4313.22s)]
*  My brain doesn't operate as fast as I'd like to for my vocabulary. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4314.22s)]
*  I try to drop way too many bombs instead of like really great words that I do know. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4319.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4322.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, so it was nice to be able to take the time and spend the agony to really kind [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4323.38s)]
*  of express word by word through it, you know, in a very real honest way. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4331.38s)]
*  It's like it's more like a like a diary, a recounting diary than it was trying to be [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4336.18s)]
*  fancy with words and overcomplicate something that's really quite so simple. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4342.42s)]
*  What was the process like of going over the words and deciding what to keep and what to [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4347.9s)]
*  edit out and how to how to format everything and what what order to talk about things? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4353.3s)]
*  The order always was working for me from the beginning. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4359.5s)]
*  It allowed for flexibility for what would come up in conversations in the writing. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4362.14s)]
*  It allowed for fluidity. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4367.54s)]
*  But there is a beginning, middle and end to this. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4368.9s)]
*  We already knew the end. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4371.54s)]
*  I knew the beginning. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4373.18s)]
*  And so it was it was the branches off of I didn't know I was going to talk about [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4374.46s)]
*  Lamaze in this book. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4380.22s)]
*  Didn't know that was a huge milestone in my life that got me to understand what [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4381.820000000001s)]
*  conscious breathing was and mitigate pain. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4389.9800000000005s)]
*  Because there's this whole thing about Lamaze. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4392.780000000001s)]
*  I was taken at 12 years old. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4394.58s)]
*  My mom was pregnant with my sister and she said, put down the cleat, son, you're not [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4396.34s)]
*  going to soccer practice. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4400.42s)]
*  Grab a pillow. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4401.34s)]
*  You're coming with me to the class. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4401.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, what class? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4404.42s)]
*  It was the Ma's class, the YMCA. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4405.62s)]
*  And my stepdad was out driving a truck or something. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4408.26s)]
*  And so my mom, she needed also needed me not to be alone. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4410.740000000001s)]
*  And she needed, you know, whatever. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4414.26s)]
*  So she brought me the oldest and I laid there with a pillow between her legs and [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4416.3s)]
*  teaching her how to breathe and short, short breaths. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4420.54s)]
*  And then they pulled down a screen and they showed this midwife birth at home at a [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4422.62s)]
*  bathtub and squirting out water. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4426.26s)]
*  This whole thing. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4428.06s)]
*  I'm like, what's going on? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4428.66s)]
*  I'm 12 years old. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4430.099999999999s)]
*  I'm mortified. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4433.259999999999s)]
*  I'm like, what happened? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4434.0599999999995s)]
*  Is that a whale breaching? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4434.74s)]
*  What was going on? [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4435.78s)]
*  You know, and so that came up in just sort of, uh, and my partner talking about it. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4437.0599999999995s)]
*  And he's like, dude, you don't realize how like, yeah, well, that's why the [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4443.179999999999s)]
*  books call my next breath. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4445.7s)]
*  You know, it's all about breathing and breathing was such a central part of my [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4446.78s)]
*  recovery, my self a part of my, you know, not dying and to get through each and [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4453.82s)]
*  every moment, uh, the perspective of breath and it is not a conscious thought. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4459.38s)]
*  It is right. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4465.46s)]
*  It just, it just, it's reflexive in our body. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4466.38s)]
*  And when we make it a consciousness, when we invest into our breath, what you can [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4468.74s)]
*  do with your mind, with your breath, right? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4474.62s)]
*  It opens up like you, the more you breathe, the more you get oxygen in your [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4476.9400000000005s)]
*  body, it's just feeding all of us. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4480.5s)]
*  It feeds you, feeds only feeds you. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4483.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4485.34s)]
*  Cause like, yawn, people yawn. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4485.62s)]
*  And I say the example of like, Oh, you're tired. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4487.14s)]
*  No, you're not tired. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4489.34s)]
*  It's your body that you know, that you need to breathe, get more oxygen in [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4490.1s)]
*  your, in yourself, right? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4493.46s)]
*  So it's, you're not tired. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4494.5s)]
*  You just need more O2. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4496.1s)]
*  That's all your body's making that happen. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4497.18s)]
*  Isn't it fascinating that everybody breathes. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4498.9800000000005s)]
*  So everybody thinks, Oh, breathing. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4501.3s)]
*  What's the big deal? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4504.1s)]
*  It's like, have you ever read James Nestor's breath or it's actually breathe, I [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4505.26s)]
*  guess, uh, but it's an amazing book on breathing techniques and the history of [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4510.780000000001s)]
*  breathing techniques and all the different things that people have achieved with [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4516.14s)]
*  breathing techniques, including holotropic breathing, which achieves psychedelic [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4520.02s)]
*  states of consciousness and all these different feats of incredible physical [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4525.06s)]
*  endurance that people have achieved through breath work. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4532.42s)]
*  It's a pretty amazing book. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4536.06s)]
*  And who's a guest of mine on the podcast a few years back, but I read his book and [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4537.1s)]
*  started really getting into it and really trying to practice different breathing [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4542.42s)]
*  exercises and great, you know, there's a bunch of breathing exercises you can use [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4547.02s)]
*  for anxiety, for overcoming very stressful situations. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4551.9800000000005s)]
*  But when you say that to most people, Oh, breathing, they're like, Oh, you're one [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4556.06s)]
*  of those guys, you're concentrating on your breathing. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4559.3s)]
*  What else you're concentrating on? [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4562.22s)]
*  Blinking, you know, it's like, cause it's like, you know what I mean? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4563.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4566.820000000001s)]
*  It's like, you can minimalize it. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4567.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4568.820000000001s)]
*  You could, you can, you have reductionist perspective where you don't think it's [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4569.1s)]
*  anything big and especially if you've never practiced it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4572.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4576.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4577.02s)]
*  But, you know, especially with like yogic breathing, you can achieve some bizarre [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4577.9400000000005s)]
*  states of relaxation and consciousness through breathing. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4581.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4585.02s)]
*  Big time. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4585.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4586.02s)]
*  And you could, you could, I always try whenever I explain it to somebody, it's, I [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4586.34s)]
*  just, I say like, when I use it, I just think I don't do it like on a daily basis. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4589.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, maybe now I do too. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4594.0199999999995s)]
*  Um, but it's like, it's, I did it for, like you said, for anxiety when I was [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4596.46s)]
*  like nervous in an audition, uh, how do I get out of this situation? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4601.139999999999s)]
*  Like I'm not in my body. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4605.46s)]
*  My heart's going like this. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4606.42s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not, how do I count it? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4607.74s)]
*  Read these lines. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4608.94s)]
*  And I hear like Sean Penn in the room and I'm supposed to go there and be better [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4609.62s)]
*  than this guy in the car. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4613.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm freaking out. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4613.82s)]
*  I'm sweating. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4614.46s)]
*  So I said, screw this. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4615.58s)]
*  I leave the room. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4617.5s)]
*  I go out of the building. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4618.42s)]
*  I go out into the street, like on Sunset Boulevard somewhere, find a tree that's [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4619.5s)]
*  rooted in this damn earth. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4623.1s)]
*  I'm the, you know, it might look ridiculous. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4624.54s)]
*  I don't care, but the courage to go down on your knees, go by the root, be in this [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4626.34s)]
*  earth, just take some deep, 10 deep breaths as cars are honking and on Sunset Boulevard. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4631.14s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4637.42s)]
*  I'm back in my body and back on this earth. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4638.9400000000005s)]
*  Here I am. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4641.58s)]
*  That's fucking go back up in that room. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4642.9400000000005s)]
*  And I smashed that audition. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4645.22s)]
*  And I don't remember if I got the role in that, but it doesn't matter. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4646.58s)]
*  I was back in my body. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4649.14s)]
*  I was back in on earth, right? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4650.14s)]
*  It wasn't like in the state of hysteria or nervousness or that, you know, cause I [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4652.14s)]
*  don't like that feeling. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4656.42s)]
*  So I found a way to overcome that feeling. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4657.580000000001s)]
*  Some people might just live in that feeling all the time. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4660.54s)]
*  They might like it. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4662.580000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4663.18s)]
*  I don't think they like it. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4663.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4665.1s)]
*  I don't think anybody likes it. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4665.5s)]
*  I think the problem is you just get trapped in that feeling. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4666.740000000001s)]
*  And then the moment something comes up, that's very difficult. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4669.06s)]
*  That causes you to spiral again. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4672.780000000001s)]
*  You just, you lose control. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4675.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4677.580000000001s)]
*  Terrible. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4678.14s)]
*  You're out of your head. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4678.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4679.38s)]
*  It's one. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4680.02s)]
*  It's one of the most difficult things about the, this whole audition process that [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4681.580000000001s)]
*  actors go through is that, you know, there's this golden carrot that's at the end of [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4686.860000000001s)]
*  the stick. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4693.900000000001s)]
*  And if you do a good job, you might be a fucking movie star. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4694.700000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4698.900000000001s)]
*  Which seems impossible, right? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4699.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4701.660000000001s)]
*  I mean, it must've seemed impossible before you pulled it off, right? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4702.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4704.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4704.9400000000005s)]
*  I know. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4705.1s)]
*  It's, it was, it was never like something I was ever aiming for really. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4705.38s)]
*  What were you aiming for? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4709.22s)]
*  Um, truth and every, and everything I was doing. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4710.42s)]
*  Truth. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4714.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4714.62s)]
*  Honesty. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4714.9400000000005s)]
*  And sure. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4715.7s)]
*  How did you get, if I don't believe it, then how do I expect someone watching me to [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4716.02s)]
*  believe it? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4719.7s)]
*  You know, I have to ensure that everything I'm doing is truthful and honest and [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4720.1s)]
*  courageous and bold and, you know, all the things. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4723.860000000001s)]
*  So it was never to try to be a movie star. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4727.22s)]
*  I just wanted to work. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4729.42s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4731.06s)]
*  I never wanted to be famous. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4731.58s)]
*  How did you acquire that perspective? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4732.74s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4735.02s)]
*  It's, it's, I was clear about what I wanted. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4735.7s)]
*  Very clear about what I wanted. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4738.54s)]
*  I didn't move down to LA to be famous. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4739.78s)]
*  I moved to LA to be in a movie, be in a movie that was big enough that would play [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4741.78s)]
*  in Modesto, California, where I'm from, because they don't get all the movies [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4745.86s)]
*  there, right? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4748.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4749.259999999999s)]
*  And being a part in that movie that I wouldn't have to tell my family, you [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4749.78s)]
*  know, I'm the guy in the red shirt waving the background. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4753.9s)]
*  It's a part big enough that you would just know I'm in the movie. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4756.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4758.86s)]
*  So I got that all those goals, uh, in the first job I ever did on camera in [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4759.0599999999995s)]
*  this national Lampoon senior trip movie. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4764.98s)]
*  So then I had to recalibrate now new goals to get myself and I was working [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4766.66s)]
*  enough, so I never, my goals were always to like, and then I wanted to be, you [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4771.7s)]
*  know, the lead in a, you know, by the time I got like Dahmer and then Hurt Locker [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4776.62s)]
*  and all these kinds of stuff, it just kind of made, I was ready for that stuff. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4780.099999999999s)]
*  But I was like 38 by that time. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4783.18s)]
*  I was like the new guy in town at 38. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4784.58s)]
*  So I was just, I was just ready and, you know, I did my journey when [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4786.9s)]
*  stockings fucking amazing. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4790.62s)]

*  people acquire or that people fall into when it comes to war. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4801.7s)]

*  It's, it was interesting. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4812.42s)]
*  I got to spend, you know, is it for, or when, uh, for about a year learning how [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4813.58s)]

*  I assess the room where I feel safe. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4968.26s)]
*  Situational awareness. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4970.34s)]
*  I always had that, but like really doing that role and spending so much time [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4972.34s)]
*  with these crew of amazing people. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4976.66s)]
*  Um, just heightened that for me. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4979.62s)]
*  The, I've always been a quiet and observer and this is where I just got in for me. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4981.86s)]
*  I could tell you the color of the hinges, if they match the finish on the [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4984.86s)]
*  doorknobs and places, and it's just that my, how my brain works and always. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4988.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4993.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4994.179999999999s)]
*  Well, it's awesome. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4994.34s)]
*  I'm a home builder and designer. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4994.98s)]
*  So I kind of pay attention to that kind of stuff anyway. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4996.259999999999s)]
*  Um, but it sort of just kind of helps me out in life, I guess. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=4999.0599999999995s)]
*  And so when you were preparing for hurt locker, was it your decision [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5003.219999999999s)]
*  to spend a year doing this? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5006.9s)]
*  Well, no, it wasn't about the amount of time. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5008.78s)]
*  I think I was maybe to go for maybe a few months. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5011.139999999999s)]
*  Catherine Bigelow, the director, um, just sort of introduced me and said, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5014.379999999999s)]
*  right, they they're ready for you at the base if you want to go. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5017.94s)]
*  So it kind of went out and just kind of did it all on my own and just waiting [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5020.219999999999s)]
*  for the movie to kind of get up and get green that and go, then just [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5023.78s)]
*  took a little bit longer. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5027.139999999999s)]
*  I think we're waiting for one of the actors that was doing another job [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5027.9s)]
*  to finish and then we could start. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5030.299999999999s)]
*  And then, uh, and then it wasn't an easy independent film to kind of [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5033.0199999999995s)]
*  get up and get rolling, but once we did, we were rocking, but yeah, it [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5036.58s)]
*  didn't meant to be like a year, year and a half of she just called me and says, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5039.94s)]
*  are you ready to go? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5043.5s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, like, like I'm getting deployed. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5044.18s)]
*  Like, yeah, let's go. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5046.42s)]
*  I'm ready. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5047.14s)]
*  And then I also, like, we didn't even have a, like an EOD sort of tech on, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5048.26s)]
*  on the shoot. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5053.54s)]
*  I had to be the person that, and I'm, I had to call back. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5054.38s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know, this doesn't look right. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5057.66s)]
*  They set up these, these one five fives and it's electrical and it should be [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5059.22s)]
*  dead cord and always all these things that I learned, but I wasn't an expert [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5062.62s)]
*  by any means, I just wanted to make it look authentic in the movie. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5066.3s)]
*  So I had to call back and call me back. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5069.46s)]
*  I mean, took a picture of this shit. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5071.26s)]
*  I don't think it's right. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5072.46s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5073.74s)]
*  And, um, yeah. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5074.18s)]
*  So. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5075.62s)]
*  I had, well, that's fortunate that you had so much experience. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5076.5s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5078.86s)]
*  It was great. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5079.86s)]
*  Because if there's anything out in that movie, especially for people that [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5080.14s)]
*  actually did that, that takes you out of it. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5084.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5086.7s)]
*  You don't, yeah. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5087.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5087.82s)]
*  Oh, and I wouldn't want to do that because we wanted to be very [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5088.26s)]
*  authentic to what we were doing. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5090.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5092.1s)]
*  We are still making a movie, but let's live in this world. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5092.42s)]
*  And look, the narrative is that the characters that live in this bizarre [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5095.22s)]
*  world in a very relevant time and this war that we're in and, and, and also [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5099.62s)]
*  the struggles of, you know, soldier and civilian life and cause they were [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5104.78s)]
*  civilians and now they became soldiers. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5109.78s)]
*  They'd be put in prison for life for doing the shit they're getting paid to do now. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5111.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5115.18s)]
*  You know, and that was a wonderful sort of outcome of the movie of how it [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5115.78s)]
*  bridged that sort of gap or the struggles of with PTSD and coming back from this [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5120.42s)]
*  harrowing sort of existence and war. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5126.1s)]
*  And then coming back and like, like the cereal aisle, where that example of like, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5128.7s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5132.5s)]
*  Like, you know, or in the rain and like, you appreciate the sun. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5133.3s)]
*  It just, it's just such a polar opposite. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5136.5s)]
*  And like, this is my existence. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5138.38s)]
*  And it became such a really, a wonderful sort of starting point for like wives to [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5139.94s)]
*  deal with their husbands that came back and like, they can kind of understand a [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5147.82s)]
*  little bit of what they might've gone through just in general, like the, the [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5151.9s)]
*  broad strokes of how hard it is. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5155.9s)]
*  And then to come back and then like, you know, change diapers and do the thing, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5158.58s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5162.139999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5162.58s)]
*  It's a, that became such a powerful thing in that narrative that I found after we [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5162.9s)]
*  did it and we're showing it to all the military bases. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5168.98s)]
*  And it's, it's always going to be a special experience in my life and always be [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5170.9s)]
*  connected to a lot of soldiers because of that. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5176.54s)]
*  Well, it was a really well done movie. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5178.78s)]
*  And it was the way you could, well, there was a thing about that movie that made [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5180.86s)]
*  you think in a way, or made me think in a way that I don't think I ever thought [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5186.62s)]
*  before, like, Oh, I never considered what this transition to civilian life is like [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5190.78s)]
*  after dealing with the unbelievable stress of being in a war zone, diffusing [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5197.46s)]
*  bombs and then wanting to go back. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5203.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5207.38s)]
*  Like it, but it made you understand. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5207.86s)]
*  It made you understand like, Oh fuck. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5210.34s)]
*  He wants to go back. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5212.3s)]
*  Like, Oh my God. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5213.22s)]
*  When a movie can do that to you, when it can take you into that psychology of the [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5217.02s)]
*  person that would be in that state and make it make sense. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5220.900000000001s)]
*  Like that's, that was a great movie. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5225.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5227.02s)]
*  I'm just happy to be part of it. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5227.66s)]
*  It was more than just, you know, it wasn't just a story. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5228.66s)]
*  It was like, you're, you're documenting a very real condition that, you know, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5231.1s)]
*  through art, you put words to these people's existence where they don't, you [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5236.82s)]
*  know, they don't have anybody representing that. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5242.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5244.62s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5245.34s)]
*  That's why it means a lot to me. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5246.42s)]
*  And they let me know it means a lot to them. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5247.62s)]
*  And that's the most special thing. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5250.0199999999995s)]
*  Like fuck it. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5251.66s)]
*  The movie part of it. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5252.26s)]
*  I think it's, it's created a dialogue for a lot of broken families or in [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5253.26s)]
*  United families better, or like you said, it's a greater understanding of like [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5258.0599999999995s)]
*  that difference of soldier civilian life. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5263.0599999999995s)]
*  It's a great bridge for it. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5264.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5265.98s)]

*  I'm very proud of that. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5266.7s)]
*  I saw it and then I went back to the comedy store and I said, oh man, we saw [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5267.38s)]
*  Hurt Locker last night and my friend went, dude, dude. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5273.34s)]
*  And that was like all we had to say like, fuck man. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5277.9s)]
*  It's like that was, it was that kind of movie. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5281.219999999999s)]
*  That's just like, oh my God. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5283.62s)]
*  Like it just gives you anxiety. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5285.179999999999s)]
*  And it also, it also just makes you like really reflect and, and think [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5287.9s)]
*  about what war is and the, and the requirement that you're putting on human [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5294.26s)]
*  beings to try to get them to transition from this insane chaos back into civilian [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5299.9400000000005s)]
*  life with no real guidance. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5305.700000000001s)]

*  How do you decide like what roles to pick when you, you know, you're at this sort of [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5319.9800000000005s)]
*  stage in your life where you're so well known, you know, you, people come to you [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5326.58s)]
*  with things and you have to decide whether or not this project is something [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5331.9400000000005s)]
*  that resonates with you. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5336.1s)]
*  Well, now it's different. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5336.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, you know, the, the central part of my life for, for so long was my career. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5338.5s)]
*  And then my daughter came around and then she's number one. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5344.74s)]
*  So then I would do the job that would allow me still to be a father. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5347.94s)]
*  Cause I, I'm not going to not be a father because my job takes me away for long [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5354.54s)]
*  periods of time and just not doing that in far places. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5358.26s)]
*  So I would, so I'm not, I'm not working in another country anymore. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5360.62s)]
*  Once my daughter was born. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5363.0599999999995s)]
*  So I always had reach and access to my daughter as fast as I needed to be. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5366.46s)]
*  And then now after the incident, I, it's even tightened up more and loosened up [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5370.42s)]
*  more because my daughter is now 12 and she doesn't need me as much. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5376.54s)]
*  She wants her friends a little bit more. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5380.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5382.0199999999995s)]
*  A little bit lower on the tonal pole. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5382.74s)]
*  This temporarily, I know, but, um, and also I can, I can travel. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5384.58s)]
*  Like I just worked last summer on a job. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5388.58s)]
*  There's a movie called knives out. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5391.3s)]
*  Um, and then they got, I got brought my whole family with me. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5393.14s)]
*  Knives out was great. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5396.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5397.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5398.06s)]
*  So this is going to be a really good one too, but I was able to bring my entire [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5398.26s)]
*  family out like 15, 15 people came out cause they, a lot of them not will travel. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5400.94s)]
*  And I got to see a lot of Europe took my mom and my daughter to the Olympics in [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5404.34s)]
*  Paris, dope, got to spend a couple of weeks in Italy and it's kind of celebrate. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5408.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5413.02s)]
*  So we can do that kind of stuff now. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5413.26s)]
*  So I did the job essentially just to have a summer vacation with my family. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5414.74s)]
*  So that's kind of how I decide. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5418.62s)]
*  And also I did love the character. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5421.78s)]
*  I did love, I mean, come on, it was all that has to line in there too. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5423.26s)]
*  I'm not just going to do a job for a job, but it just lined up, but my [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5426.06s)]
*  family has to be involved. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5429.34s)]
*  My daughter has to be involved. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5430.42s)]
*  Um, uh, friends have to be involved. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5432.0599999999995s)]
*  Otherwise I'm not going to remove myself from all those shared experiences, people [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5434.66s)]
*  in my life, just so I can go do a movie. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5438.94s)]
*  I don't want to do any movie that bad. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5440.86s)]
*  So, um, that's my limitation. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5443.78s)]
*  Well, that's that limitation is real success too. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5446.219999999999s)]
*  Did you really choose things that you're actually passionate about that fit within [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5448.82s)]
*  these parameters and allow you to live your life the way you want to. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5453.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5455.7s)]
*  And work with people that inspire me and I think, you know, I'm just not going to do [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5456.0599999999995s)]
*  a job like you can't pay me. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5459.38s)]
*  If you could put a trillion dollars in front of me, go do this. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5461.58s)]
*  You only need you for two weeks. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5463.58s)]
*  I'm like, man, it doesn't fit. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5464.58s)]
*  If it didn't check all the boxes that have real value, right? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5465.9400000000005s)]
*  Shared experience, the joy with my daughter, my family, my friends, and, you [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5468.54s)]
*  know, then it's just not worth it to me. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5472.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, I don't need to go act for, uh, to do a job. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5474.42s)]
*  I don't, right? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5479.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, you do it because you want to. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5481.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5482.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5483.38s)]
*  And that's, that's to me, what retirement is. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5483.620000000001s)]
*  And I'm doing what I want to do. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5486.1s)]
*  What do I want to do it with? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5487.740000000001s)]
*  And I'm still always going to be busy and work all my life. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5489.139999999999s)]
*  I'll do that. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5491.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5492.419999999999s)]
*  But it's not, but am I? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5492.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5494.099999999999s)]
*  But it is a better life. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5494.299999999999s)]
*  Well, it is in my mind. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5496.379999999999s)]
*  I'm a busy guy and I like, I like to, I like to contribute. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5497.62s)]
*  I'm very busy doing the renovation foundation, right? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5500.62s)]
*  Which is a huge, big central part of my life with my family that runs this, this [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5503.139999999999s)]
*  charitable foundation in my community and Lake Tahoe for foster youth and [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5508.339999999999s)]
*  disadvantaged youth and giving them opportunities that they don't have these [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5512.419999999999s)]
*  poor kids. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5515.419999999999s)]
*  Um, and that's great. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5516.54s)]
*  And I love that. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5517.419999999999s)]
*  I love, I get, but is that retirement? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5518.26s)]
*  Is it like, you know, it's, it's going to keep me busy for till I die. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5520.46s)]
*  It's weird that you have to frame things and it turns like career or retirement. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5523.9400000000005s)]
*  It's really just life, life and passions. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5528.18s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5531.860000000001s)]
*  But I don't think a lot of people are doing what they want to do in their life [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5532.700000000001s)]
*  anyway. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5535.18s)]
*  Um, but yeah, I'll always, always work, always do the things I love to do. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5536.14s)]
*  And I'm still continuing to do the things I love to do just on my own terms. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5540.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5545.740000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't be able to start this foundation if I wasn't living life on my [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5545.98s)]
*  own terms. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5549.459999999999s)]
*  I am satiated beyond satiated. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5550.099999999999s)]
*  I don't need anything. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5552.62s)]
*  I require a shared experience on this earth and that is it. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5555.0199999999995s)]
*  This is more so now since the accident. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5558.9s)]
*  Well, it's always been that, but there was a lot of things in the way or things [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5561.58s)]
*  I allowed to be in the way or things I put in the way allowed to be in the way. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5565.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5568.54s)]
*  I allowed to be in the way and now I do not. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5568.86s)]
*  I refuted, I push it away. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5571.66s)]
*  I am certainly clear when I put obstacles on my own way, when I get my own way, we [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5573.54s)]
*  all do that shit too. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5577.66s)]
*  But, uh, so I, I'm just very, very, very clear and I keep, I oversimplify life [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5579.66s)]
*  because life is just that simple. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5585.54s)]
*  If we complicated, then you're going to have an over complicated life and it's [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5587.78s)]
*  just not as valuable. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5591.42s)]
*  I think I live both. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5592.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5594.3s)]
*  And the wonderful oversimplification has allowed me to again, use the word [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5595.06s)]
*  retirement in my mind. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5600.860000000001s)]
*  I'm just living a life that I want to live, that I deserve to live, that I [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5601.98s)]
*  choose to live and not be limited or rabbit hole or victimized by society or [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5605.54s)]
*  the country I'm living in or the neighborhood I'm living in or the job I [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5612.86s)]
*  have, you know, and just not, I don't have any limitations because I'm, I'm [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5616.66s)]
*  making manifest everything that I have in my life and it feels great. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5620.0199999999995s)]
*  And, you know, I'm the captain of the ship. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5627.0199999999995s)]
*  That's why I take a minute to turn this bitch around. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5628.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5631.139999999999s)]
*  But I'm the captain of this damn ship. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5631.78s)]
*  It's called my life. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5633.34s)]
*  And I think everybody has a capacity to do so. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5634.42s)]
*  Well, that's another beautiful thing of living life by example, that can inspire [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5636.62s)]
*  people because that's really what people want to do. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5639.78s)]
*  They want to live a life where they feel like this is great. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5642.86s)]
*  Like what I'm doing is what I want to do. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5645.78s)]
*  They don't, most people, they don't live like that. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5647.9800000000005s)]
*  Most people, they have this dream in the future. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5651.1s)]
*  One day I will be able to live the way I want to, but I'm not doing it right now. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5654.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5659.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5660.1s)]
*  I think, I think that trap personally, I think you're doing it already. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5660.54s)]
*  The journey is there. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5664.5s)]
*  There's no end result besides. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5665.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5666.9400000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5759.58s)]
*  But you know, it's just like perspective is a very difficult thing to earn. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5761.26s)]
*  And so it is, it is. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5766.06s)]
*  Well, right. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5767.1s)]

*  How do we get it? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5767.780000000001s)]
*  How do we get experience, right? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5768.46s)]
*  Experience, overcoming adversity, developing characters, shared experience. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5770.74s)]
*  That's a big part of it. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5777.1s)]
*  You know, like with people that you love and you really connect with. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5778.38s)]
*  Who you surround yourself with. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5782.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5784.02s)]
*  That's most of the key to life. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5784.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5788.34s)]
*  Like if you surround yourself with really great people, you're forced to become a [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5789.26s)]
*  really great person. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5794.02s)]
*  It's like you have to keep up with it. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5794.9s)]
*  Yep. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5796.62s)]
*  This foundation, tell me how you started that. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5797.54s)]
*  Initially started with a show that I produced and put on Disney Plus, which is called [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5800.22s)]
*  Renovations. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5806.82s)]
*  And it was taking, I didn't like to see a lot of vehicles go to waste, like purpose [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5807.5s)]
*  built vehicles, like a city bus or a fire truck and all these things that supposed to [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5812.74s)]
*  go a long, long, long ways, but they just replace them even though they're perfectly [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5817.34s)]
*  good vehicles. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5821.099999999999s)]
*  So I wanted to repurpose those and help them help, you know, communities in need. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5821.62s)]
*  And like, so it's taking, I built one with to be a water truck, like a box truck to be [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5827.38s)]
*  a water treatment plant to give kids and villages with terrible water and be able to [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5831.66s)]
*  reverse osmosis their water and give them drinkable water at their school or take a [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5838.38s)]
*  there's a, it's like a city bus and turn it into like a dance studio, a mobile dance [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5842.900000000001s)]
*  studio for these kids in Mexico. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5848.06s)]
*  And just these creative sort of things. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5850.26s)]
*  And it's kind of like pit my ride, but with like real valuable things, you know, just [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5851.9800000000005s)]
*  take these really cool purpose built trucks and staying and make it something really [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5855.74s)]
*  spectacular for these kids, all kids driven to give them what their needs are. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5859.74s)]
*  And then it just went into like I didn't want to make it about just vehicles when I [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5865.5s)]
*  wanted to start the foundation, it became a wonderful calling card. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5869.42s)]
*  And then I started the foundation and my sister works for DCFS, Child Protective Services [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5872.34s)]
*  in Los Angeles County. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5876.9s)]
*  And one of my best girlfriends in Reno, she also works for CPS, Child Protective Services [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5878.34s)]
*  there. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5883.38s)]
*  So I've been working with foster youth for many, many, many years privately. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5883.74s)]
*  And now I just wanted to really get invested into the community. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5888.78s)]
*  So I started small in northern, greater northern Nevada. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5892.38s)]
*  And it's into my sister now is running it and Shane is running it as well with me and [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5895.219999999999s)]
*  the whole family has now gotten involved. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5901.179999999999s)]
*  And it's been really wonderful to come back from the incident, have this be a central [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5902.7s)]
*  goal for us to celebrate our time together as a family and to give back to these kids [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5910.86s)]
*  that are in great need. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5916.62s)]
*  And it is it has been a dream of mine that I've been wanting to do for a long time and [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5918.259999999999s)]
*  now do it publicly. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5923.0199999999995s)]
*  I've been doing it privately for a long time and to really make a big, big splash and [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5924.099999999999s)]
*  make a lot of movement for these kids. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5929.139999999999s)]
*  And it's I think it's one of the reasons why I was brought back outside of all the [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5931.219999999999s)]
*  other things. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5936.139999999999s)]
*  But I think there's something working in my favor to to come back outside just, you [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5936.82s)]
*  know, my family. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5942.179999999999s)]
*  And I think it is my reach to kids and my ability to have a great effect for them. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5943.94s)]
*  And it's been a couple of years now and it's already been moved, moved the mountains [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5949.3s)]
*  for kids already and will continue to do so. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5953.139999999999s)]
*  This is like me breathing. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5955.7s)]
*  This is easy. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5956.78s)]
*  I love this. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5957.78s)]
*  This is a part of my fiber, my body. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5958.54s)]
*  I'm the oldest of seven in my family. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5960.62s)]
*  I've been changing diapers and living as the oldest. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5963.219999999999s)]
*  It's sort of my birthright to be able to do what makes it even cooler is that I'm a [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5965.94s)]
*  Marvel superhero. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5969.58s)]
*  So I have like a reach and access to these kids that they didn't even listen to. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5970.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5974.66s)]
*  They're like, oh, cool. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5974.9s)]
*  Let's go to camp with Hawkeye. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5975.54s)]
*  That's just dope. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5976.74s)]
*  And they all show up with plastic sacks. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5978.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5979.82s)]
*  And this is like all their valuables in their life. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5980.379999999999s)]
*  And it makes me weep. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5982.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5983.9s)]
*  And this is all they're worth. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5984.099999999999s)]
*  And they show up with hefty bags, all of them. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5985.0599999999995s)]
*  So we give them rollers with their names on it and a passport. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5988.5s)]
*  This is a journal and they can change the narrative of this. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5990.98s)]
*  They're of their trial. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5994.74s)]
*  You're a traveler now. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5995.7s)]
*  You're a world traveler. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5996.54s)]
*  You're not carrying your trash around for all your your worth in it. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=5998.26s)]
*  Your worth is much bigger than that. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6002.06s)]
*  We're going to just planting seeds like that in their head and then creating community for [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6003.7s)]
*  them, creating opportunities for them, safe places for them, giving them more educated [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6008.06s)]
*  stuff. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6013.1s)]
*  Give me we can we brought in recording studio bus for them to touch all these instruments [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6013.5s)]
*  they never have access to. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6017.26s)]
*  Who knows what that does? [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6019.38s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6020.98s)]
*  Let it then have access to things. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6021.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6023.42s)]
*  Give these kids opportunities that they deserve. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6023.66s)]
*  This is the future of our fucking planet. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6026.62s)]
*  Why aren't we giving more time and effort to that? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6028.62s)]
*  It's the future of our world, man. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6031.22s)]

*  Another Elon. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6035.42s)]
*  We need other super smart, amazing people, man. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6036.82s)]
*  We need that. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6039.34s)]
*  We need other leaders. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6040.62s)]
*  And you know, what do we give in our youth, especially our foster youth, man? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6041.74s)]
*  It's not a good look. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6046.3s)]
*  They've gone through a lot of struggles, these kids, man. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6047.62s)]
*  And they're not going to struggle. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6049.7s)]
*  Not on my dime, not in my time. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6051.3s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6053.139999999999s)]

*  I love it's a great focus for me. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6056.74s)]
*  That's outside of. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6058.7s)]
*  It's things I enjoy. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6062.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6064.0199999999995s)]
*  I still do things that I enjoy. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6064.34s)]
*  I just get to do it with these kids and have they teach me so much. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6065.82s)]
*  I learned so much to keep me in a really. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6070.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, youthful spirit. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6073.7s)]
*  I it's harrowing to hear what they've been through, Joe. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6075.38s)]
*  I don't like to know. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6079.259999999999s)]
*  My sister knows all about it. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6080.58s)]
*  Shana knows all about it because they get the phone calls. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6081.86s)]
*  They have relationships with a lot of these kids. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6084.0599999999995s)]
*  They know, dude, I mean, I'd flip you. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6086.339999999999s)]
*  You'd probably react like I would. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6089.46s)]
*  You want to flip a table, hurt some people, you know, and it's so I'd prefer not to know [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6091.0599999999995s)]
*  how they got touched and who did it. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6096.74s)]
*  And you know, this kind of stuff, I just try to choose a focus on this. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6098.179999999999s)]
*  Give these kids a plant, some seeds of hope. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6101.0199999999995s)]
*  And I'm good at that shit. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6103.82s)]
*  And I love it. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6105.74s)]
*  So we're on jet ski. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6106.66s)]
*  You know, they've never even been to this lake and so whatever the heck it is, new [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6107.7s)]
*  experiences, new joy, new friends that are all crying at the end of this camp [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6111.02s)]
*  because he had such a good day and time. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6116.540000000001s)]
*  One of them was getting adopted and she was crying because like, I can't come back [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6118.02s)]
*  because I'm not a foster kid anymore. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6121.26s)]
*  I've got a top and like, oh, you can come back. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6122.620000000001s)]
*  You know, you know, you did good then when she didn't want to get adopted. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6125.14s)]
*  Like, oh, it means we're doing something right for these kids. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6128.900000000001s)]
*  And when I continue doing it and we're doing it not only just as a camp, but we're doing [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6131.46s)]
*  like lots of programs throughout the year to keep the community of the foster youth [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6135.06s)]
*  community together. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6139.38s)]
*  A lot of these kids are brothers and sisters that never get to see each other because [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6140.42s)]
*  they're in separate homes, separate cities. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6143.3s)]
*  One's in Vegas. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6145.9800000000005s)]
*  One's in Reno. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6146.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6147.34s)]
*  This that's, dude, you can't do that. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6147.58s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6149.9400000000005s)]
*  So we're doing our best to unite community. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6150.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6153.66s)]
*  Unite. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6154.06s)]
*  You need, we need each other. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6154.5s)]
*  These kids need each other even beyond that. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6155.78s)]
*  They don't need me. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6158.18s)]
*  They need access and reasons to be together. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6159.26s)]
*  So it's helping the foster parents. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6162.02s)]
*  It's helping the kids. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6164.78s)]
*  It's wherever we can do. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6165.9400000000005s)]
*  We're going to start building youth centers as well. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6166.94s)]
*  We'll be building homes as well in the future with the foundation. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6169.86s)]
*  But we're starting step by step, breath at a time, brick by brick and building camps [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6173.179999999999s)]
*  and activities and education for them. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6179.9s)]
*  And it's I love it. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6182.66s)]
*  You can see how much I love it. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6184.7s)]
*  I can talk about this for days. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6185.74s)]
*  You lit up when you talk. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6187.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6189.139999999999s)]
*  I love it, man. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6190.46s)]
*  I can't. We have these camps coming up here in June and July. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6191.259999999999s)]
*  So I'm pumped. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6194.06s)]
*  Can't wait to finish this job and go go go back home. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6195.5s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6199.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6200.1s)]
*  It's kind of shocking that it takes individuals to be inspired to do something like this [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6200.5s)]
*  because society doesn't put any emphasis on this. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6205.780000000001s)]
*  Well, it's like, look, there's a there's foster states have foster programs, right. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6210.42s)]
*  There's that's right. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6214.14s)]
*  But there's gaps in the system, man. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6215.26s)]
*  It's like kids forgotten. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6217.22s)]
*  Kids are forgotten. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6218.620000000001s)]
*  And then some are, you know, it's it's it's tragic. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6219.700000000001s)]
*  But you put a spotlight on something, put energy into something. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6224.5s)]
*  It builds. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6229.98s)]
*  And I got a loud voice and a big heart. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6230.9s)]
*  And I'm very actionable what I do. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6233.74s)]
*  And that's why the foundation is growing and making them the moves and making the [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6235.46s)]
*  paving ways for these kids. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6243.5s)]
*  So I'll keep doing it. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6244.9s)]
*  And it's like it's easy. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6246.46s)]
*  How long have you been doing this? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6248.0199999999995s)]
*  Publicly, only a couple of years. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6250.099999999999s)]
*  It's just just started out. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6252.9s)]
*  So, you know, then it's like learning about all the nonprofit stuff. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6254.219999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, man, it's like going out and asking for money. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6258.0599999999995s)]
*  So I don't do that. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6260.139999999999s)]
*  I'll go do like voiceover jobs and like put money in the account for I hate asking for [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6260.94s)]
*  money for foundation stuff. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6266.259999999999s)]
*  You know, I'll let somebody else kind of bother that. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6267.98s)]
*  I do. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6270.62s)]
*  I stay in my lane. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6271.5s)]
*  I work with the kids and work with the ideas and the programs. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6273.339999999999s)]
*  And I let my sister and those guys in the on the board deal with like you're having to [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6276.0599999999995s)]
*  raise money and all those kind of things. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6281.18s)]
*  It's just not my wheelhouse. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6282.62s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, when people hear nonprofit, they always think, OK, well, where's the money [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6283.58s)]
*  really? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6287.66s)]
*  Well, that's where it is. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6287.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's why we operate at 8 percent. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6288.780000000001s)]
*  I think. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6290.38s)]
*  8 percent. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6291.5s)]
*  Yeah, nobody does that. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6292.22s)]
*  That's the opposite of how they're usually done. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6293.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6295.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6296.22s)]
*  So, I mean, even if we got to because no one no one takes anything except just basic [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6296.62s)]
*  operating costs and we're operating at 8 percent. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6301.26s)]
*  I think 13 percent is like all the money is going to the kids, man. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6303.34s)]
*  All of it. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6307.820000000001s)]
*  All of it. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6308.62s)]
*  All of it. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6309.9800000000005s)]
*  So I'm trying to get to the bank account to be full. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6310.86s)]
*  So we only operate off the interest. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6313.9s)]
*  Once we're there, then we can really start to start to move needle for building things [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6317.66s)]
*  and doing some stuff in the future. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6323.099999999999s)]
*  So I'm excited for that. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6324.54s)]
*  Are you going to expand this? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6326.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it'll grow. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6327.9s)]
*  It'll grow. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6328.62s)]
*  Again, I think to keep effective for me is staying in the home area or just the state [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6329.98s)]
*  of Nevada, at least, and not going too far. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6335.58s)]
*  Because I'm very, very hands on and it's important for me to be the voice for the [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6338.7s)]
*  foundation and for these kids and an advocate for them. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6344.3s)]
*  And so Nevada is kind of the goal for the next five years, for sure. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6348.14s)]
*  And there's still a ton of kids that I have not reached and need to reach. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6355.58s)]
*  So I focus on that. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6359.82s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6363.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6363.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6364.46s)]
*  Then there's getting these youths that age out, but getting back into being counselors [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6364.62s)]
*  back in the camp. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6370.78s)]
*  There's a great thing with UNR, they get a free ride at the university. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6372.3s)]
*  And a lot of them are going back into sociology and psychology and want to go help [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6378.3s)]
*  kids and foster. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6382.22s)]
*  Like, this is so great. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6383.18s)]
*  So I want to give them opportunities to come back and help the youth and maybe give them [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6384.14s)]
*  guidance. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6389.1s)]
*  God, this is awesome. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6389.74s)]
*  Self-healing and cathartic in its own way. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6391.18s)]
*  Whatever we can do, man. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6393.82s)]
*  It's a wonderful, wonderful life. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6395.82s)]
*  That's amazing because you light up when you talk about that like nothing else we've [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6400.94s)]
*  talked about. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6404.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6406.7s)]
*  It's everything. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6408.86s)]
*  Again, I'm focusing my energy on all the positive stuff, you know, because I can't [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6410.54s)]
*  be too sensitive to deal with the hardships that they go through. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6416.38s)]
*  So let me just be a guide, a guiding light for them or someone to laugh on. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6421.0199999999995s)]
*  They can sign my t-shirts, whatever they want to do. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6427.5s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6429.5s)]
*  I'm their playground. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6429.9s)]
*  I love it, man. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6432.7s)]
*  Again, I think it's the reason why I came back, Joe. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6434.94s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6438.379999999999s)]
*  You could see that it means so much to you. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6440.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6442.139999999999s)]
*  And that's just if you could find something like that in life, you're a winner. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6442.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6446.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6447.66s)]
*  I mean, just think of the amount of positive energy you put out there in the world. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6448.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty exponential. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6452.780000000001s)]
*  And then also how it cascades. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6455.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6457.580000000001s)]
*  The ripple effect of that is insane. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6457.9800000000005s)]
*  Changed their lives. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6460.3s)]
*  They'll change other people's lives. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6461.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6462.780000000001s)]
*  And then it comes back. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6463.1s)]
*  It's pretty what you put out in the world is what you get back, you know? [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6465.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6468.3s)]
*  I see it every day and it's exponential, especially now since the incident. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6469.580000000001s)]
*  The ripple effect of just, dude, this happened in my [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6474.780000000001s)]
*  driveways, a private experience. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6477.9s)]
*  I woke up and it was a global thing. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6480.54s)]
*  I didn't ask for that. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6483.259999999999s)]
*  I'm so kind of glad it did. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6484.54s)]
*  It allowed people to see me as the man that I am and not the guy that slings an arrow. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6486.139999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6491.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6491.98s)]
*  It's a fake arrow because it's CGI. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6494.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6495.82s)]
*  You know, so I'm glad it became a big public thing, but you know, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6498.54s)]
*  the ripple effect of just this narrative of the recovery is [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6502.219999999999s)]
*  like you said, it can affect a lot of people and it's a beautiful thing. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6508.0599999999995s)]
*  It's a positive thing and like the foundation and I see it and feel it every day. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6510.299999999999s)]
*  You really lead an exemplary life, my friend. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6515.58s)]
*  Well, I, what's the alternative? [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6518.379999999999s)]
*  I know, but I mean, it's interesting that you have this perspective. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6522.379999999999s)]
*  Like I'm always curious that people that have such an amazing perspective, like [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6525.42s)]
*  how did you gain it? [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6529.82s)]
*  Like how did you get to this place? [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6531.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6534.94s)]
*  Well, I mean, you have to, I think you have to life and review, right? [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6535.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6540.46s)]
*  You know, there's a life and review. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6540.780000000001s)]
*  I think there's, I think, you know, there's birth order, right? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6541.9800000000005s)]
*  There's also being in the seventies in a small town where I was a latchkey kid, right? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6545.66s)]
*  You didn't, I had free reign at seven years old and a key to the house. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6551.34s)]
*  You didn't have to come home to the street lights came on. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6556.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6559.1s)]
*  Me too. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6559.34s)]
*  I made mistakes. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6559.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6561.02s)]
*  I broke windows and slingshots and stole shit and light up the cigarette butt and my, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6561.26s)]
*  my mom's and all this stuff. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6566.38s)]
*  I got caught. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6567.900000000001s)]
*  And sometimes I learned, I reprimand myself. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6568.54s)]
*  I self-policed myself. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6571.26s)]
*  I was very honest kid. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6573.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, there's a lot, a lot of, a lot of things, you know, I had, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6576.38s)]
*  I had a bicycle and then that was like freedom. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6579.5s)]
*  That's where I began like, oh, I have real freedom. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6582.54s)]
*  I got fishing pole, got on my bike and just went off into another county. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6585.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6589.26s)]
*  Like that wouldn't happen today. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6589.5s)]
*  I would never allow my daughter to walk across the street. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6590.7s)]
*  I had a similar life. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6595.98s)]
*  I was a latchkey kid too. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6597.42s)]
*  And I just think the whole. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6598.62s)]
*  Where was this? [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6599.82s)]
*  Well, I lived all over the place, but I lived when I was seven to 11. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6600.94s)]
*  I lived in San Francisco from 11 to 13. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6604.54s)]
*  I lived in Florida from 13 till 24. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6607.26s)]
*  I lived in Boston. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6611.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6612.46s)]
*  Then New York and out here. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6613.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6614.78s)]
*  And well, LA rather. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6615.42s)]
*  And then out here last five years. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6616.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6618.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6619.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6619.42s)]
*  Well, that's a good mix. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6619.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's good mix. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6621.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6621.98s)]
*  Well, the good thing about living in a bunch of different places, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6622.139999999999s)]
*  the bad thing is I never really developed roots. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6624.54s)]
*  But I had to form my own opinions because I couldn't [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6628.379999999999s)]
*  count on the opinions of all the people around me. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6633.66s)]
*  I didn't have like a core group of friends. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6638.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6640.379999999999s)]
*  So I always had to like sort of see the world for what it was. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6640.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6646.459999999999s)]
*  Did that make you an introvert or an extrovert or both? [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6646.7s)]
*  I think I was an introvert initially. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6649.66s)]
*  I don't think I ever even though I talk for a living and I'm a public figure, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6651.98s)]
*  I'm not really an extrovert, which is really odd. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6655.42s)]
*  I don't really like attention, which sounds crazy for someone who gets a lot of attention. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6657.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6661.26s)]
*  I don't need it, which is probably why I get it in some strange. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6661.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6665.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6666.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6666.94s)]
*  Some strange. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6667.74s)]
*  I was very socially anxious when I was a kid. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6668.46s)]
*  I would get super nervous when I had to talk to a bank teller. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6671.26s)]
*  I remember one time I had to deposit money in a bank and I was like, [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6674.22s)]
*  why am I freaking out like this? [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6677.099999999999s)]
*  This is so weird. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6678.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6679.34s)]
*  You know, but eventually overcame all that stuff and then, you know, [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6679.82s)]
*  through martial arts, traveling around all throughout my youth from the time I was 15 [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6687.02s)]
*  till I was 22. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6693.1s)]
*  That's all I did was travel around the country and competing. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6694.7s)]
*  So I had a very bizarre life in that I didn't have like the normal high school life of [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6698.22s)]
*  partying and hanging out. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6705.02s)]
*  And I was, you know, flying to California to fight. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6706.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6710.14s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6710.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6711.82s)]
*  It was a very weird life. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6711.9800000000005s)]
*  So I, you know, I still wasn't an extrovert. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6714.06s)]
*  Like I didn't really learn how to talk in groups of people till I started teaching. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6719.34s)]
*  So I started teaching martial arts and then that's how I learned how to public speak. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6723.9800000000005s)]
*  But I was publicly speaking about something that I was very good at. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6729.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6733.5s)]
*  So it was like I commanded sort of attention just by because I would demonstrate to them [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6733.66s)]
*  things that I was doing and then in demonstrating and talking, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6739.18s)]
*  it made sense that I was able to talk. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6743.82s)]
*  About something you knew very well and you're comfortable in. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6745.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6748.139999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like I was really good at it so I could show them. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6749.099999999999s)]
*  I'm going to demonstrate something to you and then I do it and they'd be like, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6752.62s)]
*  holy shit. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6755.42s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to show you how to do this. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6756.38s)]
*  And then if you listen to me, like I taught at Boston University [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6758.38s)]
*  and when I was 19 and it was real counter towards your GPA. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6761.98s)]
*  It was like pass fail a and I'd say all you have to do is show up and try and you get an A. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6766.7s)]
*  And if you can't show up, call me, tell me you can't make it and you'll be fine. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6773.42s)]
*  If you fuck off, I'm going to fail you. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6777.82s)]
*  But if you just try, you get an A and then it counts towards your GPA. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6780.22s)]
*  This is like a legit thing. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6783.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6784.94s)]
*  Like, well, all I want you to do is like this can help your life. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6785.34s)]
*  And I'm not thinking you're going to go and fight and compete, but I can teach you something here. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6788.94s)]
*  And it's difficult, but you'll get better at it. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6795.34s)]
*  And through getting better at it, you'll learn how to get better at other things. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6797.66s)]
*  The discipline. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6800.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6801.18s)]
*  So that's like how I got into comedy in the oddest way, learning how to talk to people. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6801.82s)]
*  Because I wasn't comfortable talking to people. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6808.06s)]
*  I always felt like a loser and a weirdo and I always felt like an outcast. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6810.38s)]
*  So to learn how to talk publicly, like that's how I did. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6815.1s)]
*  But all that traveling around just gave me this very bizarre, [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6821.34s)]
*  rootless sense of who I was as a person. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6824.9400000000005s)]
*  Is there anything that you grabbed from that experience that you hold onto? [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6828.78s)]
*  There's just some positive things that kind of come out from that, right? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6835.9800000000005s)]
*  Like I went to a different school every year in my life, at least until I got to high school. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6840.06s)]
*  But I was in the same town. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6843.82s)]
*  I didn't move around a lot. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6844.94s)]
*  Maybe just in the town I did. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6846.299999999999s)]
*  Divorce and all that sort of stuff, our schools were full, whatever it was. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6847.82s)]
*  So I had to either engage with people, all brand new people, each grade, new school, new grade. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6851.259999999999s)]
*  And then you're growing up, I was more shy and I think more like you, like an introvert. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6858.219999999999s)]
*  And so either I was very gregarious or I just was an observer and I just watched. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6862.62s)]
*  So you just make choices and that's why I became an observer. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6867.74s)]
*  But with that, I don't know, I like that part of me. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6872.14s)]
*  And I can be extroverted like I'm an actor and a thing, but I'm still more insular and quiet. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6876.860000000001s)]
*  And even though the two quiet guys are yapping their jaws off for hours. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6881.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, it was hard, but I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6887.1s)]
*  Because I think it made me different. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6893.26s)]
*  You know, and I think there's, unfortunately, if you are in like a small town and you grow up in [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6896.06s)]
*  that town and you never leave that town, your perspective is very limited. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6904.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6907.820000000001s)]
*  And I moved around a lot and I think that was very uncomfortable. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6908.38s)]
*  I hated it when I was a kid, like, fuck, we're moving again to another state. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6913.9800000000005s)]
*  But that made me who I am. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6919.58s)]
*  And again, it made me form my own opinions instead of adopting [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6923.1s)]
*  a conglomeration of opinions that everybody around me had. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6927.02s)]
*  I went from very liberal and progressive San Francisco in the 1970s during the Vietnam War [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6931.74s)]
*  to living in Florida, where it was like completely the opposite, like super conservative and kind of [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6937.5s)]
*  retarded. And I remember just being around people like, why do they even think like this? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6943.58s)]
*  This is crazy. It was so strange to me to have this like complete juxtaposition, [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6949.74s)]
*  almost like a cultural 180. But it also made me realize like, wow, there's a lot of different [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6954.62s)]
*  ways to think. There's a lot of different ways to engage with life. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6959.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6964.139999999999s)]
*  You know? [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6964.46s)]
*  Well, especially growing up, right? You're just saying like seven, eight, 13, 14, all those years [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6965.5s)]
*  we look to our friends and friendship groups to sort of like kind of help develop ourselves and [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6970.38s)]
*  kind of be a reflection upon ourselves. And if you don't have it, you have other things that you [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6976.700000000001s)]
*  turn to. But like you said, it could have been a terrible thing if you stayed in the same place. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6982.3s)]
*  You had the same core four dos and then how limited your life would have been to stay in [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6987.1s)]
*  San Fran. So like you said, there's a real good positive thing to take from being removed from [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6991.5s)]
*  stability, removed from, right? That's all anxiety inducing. Or it could be the perspective, right? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=6998.46s)]
*  The perspective could be if it's a positive perspective, you know, to lean on. Yeah. Like [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7004.62s)]
*  you said, I like how I came in a thing and it drove you into all the things that you probably [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7009.34s)]
*  like about yourself today. I think it's pretty interesting. Yeah. And it also like I got picked [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7013.82s)]
*  on a lot too, in which that's what drove me into martial arts. Yeah. Boston days. Yeah. I hate being [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7018.62s)]
*  scared of people. Yeah. It just drove me nuts. Yeah. I didn't have friends. So like a group of [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7025.58s)]
*  guys would fuck with me and I didn't know what to do. So I was like, okay, I gotta fix this. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7030.3s)]
*  So I became obsessed with martial arts. And then once I started doing that, it was like the first [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7035.34s)]
*  thing that I ever did, it was like, hey, I don't think I'm a loser. I just think I never figured [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7040.14s)]
*  out how to get good at something. And now that I'm really good at this one thing, I'm like the [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7044.54s)]
*  opposite of a loser. And then I became obsessed with winning, you know, and then that was like [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7048.22s)]
*  my whole life until I was like, I don't think I want to do this anymore. And then I, you know, [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7053.42s)]
*  transitioned to other things, but that period of time wouldn't have happened if I lived in a [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7058.3s)]
*  comfortable environment where I wasn't fucked with and where I didn't get bullied. You know, [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7064.62s)]
*  I wouldn't have that desire to like do something that was completely terrifying because I was [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7069.34s)]
*  scared of physical confrontation. So what do I do? Spend my whole life getting involved in like [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7075.34s)]
*  voluntary physical confrontation with trained fighters, which is way more terrifying, [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7083.66s)]
*  the most terrifying thing, you know, but that, but what's the alternative? Oh, just be scared and be [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7088.78s)]
*  bullied and beat the fuck up. That's what I had to decide. Yeah. You know, take the reins. I had to [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7096.139999999999s)]
*  decide that. I just had to make this change, you know? Yeah. Fortunately it worked out. Yeah. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7100.7s)]
*  It's very bizarre. The turns that life takes. And when you look back, you're like, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7108.38s)]
*  what if that hadn't happened? What if I hadn't done this? What if I hadn't, what if I hadn't [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7113.1s)]
*  turned left? Yeah. The crossroads are so, so, so instrumental in who we become. Right. And [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7117.02s)]
*  in control of that, like we're not steering any ship at that point. Right. So much of it is luck. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7124.7s)]
*  Yeah. Or whatever it is or fate, whatever fate means. Yeah. You know what I mean? Fate is kind [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7129.34s)]
*  of assumed once an outcome has been achieved. Oh, it was fate. Yeah. In hindsight. Was it really? [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7134.86s)]
*  In hindsight, you can say that. Yeah. I'm not sure. Say that in the moment. Right. I do think [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7140.46s)]
*  there's, there's a certain power to following instincts, which I've always done for whatever [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7145.66s)]
*  reason. You know, there's a, there's a pull that you have towards a certain direction, even if it's [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7151.74s)]
*  like massively uncomfortable. Like sometimes you have to realize like, okay, let's go. Like this is [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7156.62s)]
*  what I'm supposed to do. And that, that is very hard to do. But once you do it a few times and [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7162.22s)]
*  then you start saying that there's a little voice in your head, like that motherfucker's never let [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7167.66s)]
*  me down. I'm going to keep serving that voice, whatever that voice is. I'm going to keep listening. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7172.54s)]
*  Even though people are like, what are you doing? And I'm like, ah, I'm not going to listen to you. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7177.9800000000005s)]
*  I hear that a lot. Yeah. I think so to a lot of people that have accomplished great things. Yeah. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7183.02s)]
*  I don't think anybody who listens to the advice of everyone around them ever steps out of line. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7189.9s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I think you, I don't think you ever really try anything crazy. Yeah. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7194.94s)]
*  You got it. Because most people aren't going to want to support you when you're trying something [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7198.78s)]
*  that seems insane, whether it's trying to be a movie star or whatever it is, trying to be a [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7202.7s)]
*  martial artist or a rock star or anything in life that's hard to do. Most people are going to tell [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7207.339999999999s)]
*  you don't do that. Especially people that are conservative and conservative in a sense of like [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7212.299999999999s)]
*  do something that is going to give you a good chance of success. Yeah. Because the more fun [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7218.54s)]
*  things are very open-ended. They don't really have a lot of six. Like what are the, what's, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7224.94s)]
*  what are the numbers of people that become successful actors? Oh, I mean, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7230.219999999999s)]
*  it's just, is it like a 10th of a percent? It's probably less than that. I mean, if you could [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7233.9s)]
*  like get a chart of like how many people move to Los Angeles to try to make it in show business, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7240.7s)]
*  and how many make it, it's gotta be an astronomic. The numbers are not good. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7247.58s)]
*  Insane. Those numbers have to be insane. Yeah. But some, my thought was like, fuck, somebody's [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7252.62s)]
*  doing it. Like somebody did it. Like, why can't I do it? And then people would say, you're not, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7259.1s)]
*  you know what, well, the odds are going to make it. Like, I don't know. Why am I thinking about [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7263.82s)]
*  that? Someone, it can be done. Yeah. People have done it. Like you gotta, but you have to be willing [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7268.62s)]
*  to just really fucking throw yourself into something and know that, especially in the [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7275.58s)]
*  beginning, there's no time to fuck off here. If you really want to do something that's really [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7283.0199999999995s)]
*  hard to do, like you gotta be all in, because there's too many people that are all in and [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7287.98s)]
*  you're competing with them. You're not competing with these like half-steppers, these people that [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7293.82s)]
*  are kind of dipping in and dipping out. They're there as an example for you to not live your life. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7298.22s)]
*  Yeah. Well, isn't there like a kind of a selective hearing that kind of has to happen [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7302.94s)]
*  in anything for anyone. We have to listen and really listen to engage and really listen to learn [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7307.259999999999s)]
*  and grow. But then we have to have selective listening to like, how many times I was told no, [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7314.54s)]
*  or told I was crazy, or to like, what are you doing? You out of your mind? I'm like, oh, now I [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7319.0199999999995s)]
*  knew I'm on the right track when I hear that. Because that's the words of a fearful person. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7323.66s)]
*  Those are the words uttered from someone who's scared and not courageous and a lot of stuff's [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7329.58s)]
*  in their way. I'm on the right track. Well, not just that. There are those people that would try [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7336.06s)]
*  to sabotage you because they don't want you to be successful because they haven't taken a chance in [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7340.62s)]
*  their life. So they don't want anybody who does, who's courageous. They want you to fail. There's [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7344.860000000001s)]
*  people out there that want people that are courageous to fall apart because then it makes [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7350.3s)]
*  them feel better for their own choices. That's okay. They got to live with that. I don't, right? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7355.18s)]
*  Right. They got to swim in that. But again, I think that those things are just like, you need [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7360.22s)]
*  the rain to appreciate the sun. You need to struggle to appreciate love. They have to coexist, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7366.38s)]
*  otherwise they don't exist. It's like a truth and a lie. They both have to exist. Otherwise, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7372.9400000000005s)]
*  everything's just fucking true. Right. So you have to coexist together, otherwise you don't. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7377.42s)]
*  That's the hardest part of life to truly understand. Why is there evil? Because you [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7382.06s)]
*  need love. You need good. Why can't everything be love? Well, it can't. It can't. There has to be [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7387.820000000001s)]
*  evil people for you to appreciate loving people. There really has to be kind people for you to [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7394.9400000000005s)]
*  appreciate, oh, okay, life is not just all cruelty. But you have to know that cruelty exists for you [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7402.620000000001s)]
*  to appreciate kindness. Weird. It's a weird dance. And it's strange. Yeah. If God is real, [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7409.74s)]
*  what a strange game he's playing. But you can kind of, when it all works out, you see wisdom in it. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7418.46s)]
*  You're like, I kind of get it. Life is not just utopia. It's a strange mix of good and evil, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7427.66s)]
*  and love and hate and all these things that are in the way. Yeah, those tests, man, those tests, [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7435.42s)]
*  don't they suck? They do. All the tests we have in our lives, and everybody has them. Everybody. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7444.06s)]
*  There's nobody that's exempt from it. No one. I mean, I was money, I was successful. You are all [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7449.1s)]
*  susceptible to great tests and great suffering. It's how well you overcome that suffering [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7454.62s)]
*  and will determine how well you love and deeply you love in your life. And also the people that [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7460.54s)]
*  have overcome the most are the most fascinating and interesting and complex. Aren't they? [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7465.66s)]
*  Have you ever met Amanda Knox? Do you know who she is? Yeah, I know she is. She's that woman that was [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7471.1s)]
*  accused wrongly of a murder in Italy. Yeah, I remember that. She spent years in prison [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7476.14s)]
*  and in Italy, and she is so fascinating. Yeah, she's so strong and so interesting. And I asked [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7481.5s)]
*  her about this. I was like, do you ever think, you are this really unusual person with this [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7488.3s)]
*  fucking cast iron integrity and character. Would you be this person if you hadn't been [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7495.66s)]
*  wrongly accused and spent years in prison and publicly persecuted and then eventually [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7503.18s)]
*  absolved? Who would you be? Would you want it any other way? I wouldn't wish that on anybody. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7509.42s)]
*  Here you meet her. She's so incredible. It's like life is very, very odd. Yeah. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7517.42s)]
*  There's choices that she could have made, right? In that she could have been resentful. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7523.9s)]
*  I don't know how she is, so I don't know. She's not at all. Yeah. And she could have been valid in [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7531.259999999999s)]
*  any kind of feeling she has about things because that sounds pretty shitty. Yeah. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7535.9s)]
*  And but, you know, what's the alternative? You want to hold on to resentment and that kind of, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7541.02s)]
*  is that the life you want to live because it's your choice? Right. I like, it sounds like an [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7546.780000000001s)]
*  interesting person to talk about, but, you know, is it a choice or a choice for her? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7551.02s)]
*  Right. Did she feel like it was a choice? Like, you know, it certainly wasn't. Yeah. No. Did she [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7556.14s)]
*  feel like that that made her who she is and she's content with that or? I mean, she's certainly [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7560.46s)]
*  resigned to what it is, but she's very happy now. Right. But not just happy, like complex, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7566.7s)]
*  like a complex, compassionate, charitable thinker. What's the conversation if she's still in the [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7574.0599999999995s)]
*  joint, you know? Oh, yeah. I mean, she's still in the clank and there's no hope of her getting out. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7580.38s)]
*  Well, she learned a lot in there, too. Yeah, I bet. People, like what the terrible choices that [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7584.62s)]
*  people make, because most of the people that were in there were guilty, you know, and the terrible [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7591.099999999999s)]
*  choices that these people make and like what happened to you when you were young? Like, why [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7595.34s)]
*  did you become a person who murdered your husband? Why did you become a person who, you know, robbed [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7599.34s)]
*  a bank? Why did you, what went wrong? You used to be a baby, you know? Yeah. This is something that I [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7604.14s)]
*  really changed, being a parent really changed my perspective of human beings in a very profound [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7611.82s)]
*  way, in many, many profound ways. But one of the biggest ones is I stopped looking at people as [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7618.7s)]
*  being static. I stopped looking at, oh, Jeremy's 54, he's always been 54. That's how I know it. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7622.94s)]
*  Now I look at everybody like, oh, you were a baby. You were a baby. Like, you know what I mean? [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7628.46s)]
*  You know, I love my daughters dearly and they're very extraordinary people, but it's been fascinating [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7635.58s)]
*  to watch them as little babies become these really complex human beings and have conversations with [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7640.54s)]
*  them and talk to them and see how they interface with life. And then I meet people who are all [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7647.42s)]
*  fucked up and angry and fucking hateful and I'm like, God damn, what happened? What went wrong? [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7653.02s)]
*  What are the things that, and how do you get out of this? You know? Yeah. It's interesting. Yeah. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7661.82s)]
*  It's, you know. I mean, it's, there's so many trials and tribulations in this [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7669.179999999999s)]
*  wonderful existence that we all share. And I think we learn a lot through other people's, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7676.139999999999s)]
*  not just your own, but other people's. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Well, that's the hope anyway. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7682.3s)]
*  We can, right? Yeah. Well, I think a lot of people are going to learn a lot through you. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7686.139999999999s)]
*  And without having to do it in a fearful way or scare tactics or, you know what I mean? [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7691.0199999999995s)]
*  That doesn't really work. Yeah. Yeah. But it's used everywhere in media and advertising and all [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7695.26s)]
*  that kind of stuff. Right. Right. But like to do it in an honest way or it's like, I hope, I still [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7701.18s)]
*  learn by talking about my experience, right? I still learn by looking through the book or listening [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7706.780000000001s)]
*  to the audio. I'll be listening to the audio soon when I have my daughter and all my nieces, nephews [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7713.26s)]
*  around, we're going to listen to it. We're all going to listen to it together. So I'm not going [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7718.06s)]
*  to have them go off reading this thing. It's too harrowing to do it alone. But like, I'll be [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7721.18s)]
*  listening to it. I'm going to learn through it. And with that experience and that exchange with [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7725.42s)]
*  these beautiful young creatures. Yeah. You know, so there's something learning for so long. It's [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7729.42s)]
*  only been a couple of years. It's really crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll keep, keep trying and [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7735.1s)]
*  testing the limits of, of my body and my mind and my spirit and what I can pass on to others, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7740.62s)]
*  what I can give on to others, what they give me. I mean, it is a vibrant, high, high vibration [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7747.34s)]
*  that I'm living right now. And I, I'm so blessed to have it. And so much gratitude at every breath. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7753.58s)]
*  I almost feel like I don't have to walk anywhere to sort of live it. I just feel so lucky. And [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7766.14s)]
*  I think it's has to do with all the love and all the, all the, the goodness that this world has to [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7774.0599999999995s)]
*  offer. I think that's, it's gotten me through and the attitude of it, that perspective of that, [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7785.5s)]
*  because it can be a very bleak, dark place. Yeah. You know, but I, I choose to, I choose love, [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7793.099999999999s)]
*  I choose action. I choose my perspective. It is my choice. And I've been, I've been in dark [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7799.18s)]
*  places where it wasn't quite so positive and so lovely. It was well before the accident, you know, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7811.1s)]
*  where just like, you know, just kind of grumbly and grumpy and don't want to leave my house. And [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7816.38s)]
*  you know, I don't want to go sign on a grant. I don't want to be around people or, you know, [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7820.62s)]
*  I'm just kind of whatever, you know, not a really great, happy place, perhaps, you know, [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7823.9s)]
*  like everybody has the right to be, but if that doesn't exist at this point, you know, [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7828.78s)]
*  I don't get any more bad days, Joe. That's amazing. Right? You're like, fuck, I wanted that. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7833.259999999999s)]
*  I can gas up a snowcat for you one. I can make it happen for you. Isn't that incredible? No more [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7840.299999999999s)]
*  bad days, brother. Right? Wow. It's a, it's a perspective that is mine and a truth and reality [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7844.62s)]
*  that is mine. Cause I have a barometer to like, yeah, I know what a bad day is actually like. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7850.3s)]
*  And I was tested to my limits and I got through it, luckily somehow, some way. And it's, it's a, [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7854.7s)]
*  it's just a, almost science at this point, it's a factual that it's just not going to happen. I can't [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7862.14s)]
*  no matter if I tried so hard to have a bad day, it's just not going to happen. I can have a bad [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7866.9400000000005s)]
*  moment. I can have, you know, frustrating times, but it's not, I'm just not going to have a bad day. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7870.46s)]
*  And for the rest of my experience here on earth, that's amazing. And I think that experience, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7874.7s)]
*  this, this perspective that you're sharing is contagious. I think so too, dude. Yeah. I know, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7881.099999999999s)]
*  actually I know. So I know so for a fact, for a fact, it's, it's, it's a, it's sort of make [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7886.3s)]
*  manifestation of what your existence is. Do you want it to be? Yeah. And you can do it. Yeah. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7891.9s)]
*  We got to believe it. You got to do it. Yeah. Both those things. I think that's why it's beautiful [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7897.26s)]
*  that you wrote this book. Yeah. My next breath. Yes, sir. Thank you, Jeremy. Awesome. I really, [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ei_oa-vaJA&t=7901.58s)]
