# Joe Rogan Experience #1471 - Tony Hinchcliffe
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKaySfPomOI)
*  Three, two, one.
*  Tony motherfucking Hinge
*  Gleff
*  Yeah. Good to see you buddy. Good to see you.
*  Every time comics come here
*  that I usually spend multiple nights a week with
*  like, ahhh.
*  So nice to be semi-normal again.
*  Yes. For fucking sure.
*  The restrictions are supposed to be lifting up here in Los Angeles
*  on Friday, which means nothing for us.
*  For comedians. It means something for like some retail
*  some other stuff, but they're doing it nice and slow
*  and did you see the list of shit that the governor's office put out
*  of stuff you're allowed to do?
*  You should pull that up, Jamie, because it is
*  it's quite hilarious.
*  First of all, it's kind of condescending.
*  It's like treating you like you're a moron.
*  Like, here's things you're allowed to do.
*  One of them that I thought was hilarious said soft martial arts.
*  Yeah. It said Tai Chi.
*  This is you're allowed to do this outside.
*  Soft martial arts. No.
*  Like, why can't you do, why can't you shadow box?
*  Can you do that? Yeah.
*  Or it's only okay if you do things that don't work?
*  Like, you're saying martial.
*  Martial art. That's an art of war.
*  Right? And Tai Chi is
*  it is a, it's much more of a meditation than it is an art of war.
*  I think it's very beneficial.
*  But like, look at what it says. Athletics, number one.
*  What does that mean? Badminton? Singles?
*  Singles? Throwing a ball?
*  A baseball, softball, stop. Here's the problem with that.
*  Yeah. If you're throwing a baseball, you're basically shaking hands.
*  Yep. And you're doing it with an organic skin, right?
*  Baseball, the outside of it is cow skin.
*  You could throw a ball by yourself, but...
*  But that's not what they're saying. I know. Right?
*  That's sad. You're gonna throw it and go...
*  Just throw it and go pick it up.
*  Throwing fly balls to yourself in the park.
*  BMX, biking. Okay, thank you.
*  You're allowed to canoe singles.
*  Oh. Like it specifies.
*  What's singles? Are they talking about crabbing like crab walk?
*  No, like catching crabs. You can go crabbing like fishing.
*  No, that's what it means. Oh. Yeah. You can go crabbing.
*  People do it all the time? Oh yeah. In California.
*  Not here, but in Northern California. It's a big deal.
*  Yeah, I've done it before. You catch blue crabs. I think they are.
*  I think they're blue. I don't know what species they are.
*  But you catch them off the piers. Like over there.
*  There's a lot of areas around San Francisco where people catch crabs.
*  It's really big in like Maryland.
*  And you know, those guys love crabbing.
*  Oh, and Alaska too. They do a lot of crabbing.
*  I know that thing. It was just a California list. That's why I was like...
*  They must have them in the oceans right here.
*  Gardening, not in groups.
*  Oh, you can explore rock pools. Thank you.
*  Oh wow. Where can we do that at?
*  Malibu, but you can't get to the beach. It's closed.
*  Cycling, golf, singles, walking.
*  No cart, Tony. Oh my gosh. You can't have a cart.
*  Why can't I have a cart? What if it's my cart?
*  I can't take the cart? It's electric. It doesn't even hurt the environment.
*  What is... Why can't I take the cart?
*  Yeah, or why can't they clean it?
*  Is there a logic to that? Let's stop.
*  I mean, if it's your cart, is there a logic to that?
*  And how is it any different than the cart at the supermarket?
*  Like that motherfucker is getting passed around like a cheap hoe.
*  I think it's because they have to have people clean it and whatnot.
*  And they don't want to have to have staff on whatever.
*  Because they've opened up...
*  Right, but they have it at the supermarket.
*  No, I know, but...
*  You know what I'm saying? I know your point.
*  It's like it's real squirrely.
*  It's like the places we absolutely have to go, they're allowed to stay open.
*  Yeah, and even the shopping cart.
*  I was shopping the other day and I opened up the kitty part, you know, to put other stuff in.
*  And I'm like, they didn't... There's no way they wiped that part well.
*  There's just no way. If it was on here, I got it.
*  After a while, I'm sure the people that work in those places,
*  the kids especially, like 18 year olds, they're going to slack off.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like no one's dead.
*  They don't see it. You know, they're not going to the hospital.
*  Hold on. Don't scroll down yet.
*  There's a lot more we missed.
*  Go back up.
*  So, yeah, so we were at no cart golf, hiking, trails, paths, allowing distancing.
*  How is it okay when you're running?
*  Because if you're running past people that are walking,
*  this is going to come in time when you're right there.
*  Is that all right?
*  I don't know.
*  This is all very bizarre.
*  Well, it's all... It really is like we're dealing with multiple different diseases too.
*  Are the trails open? I thought they were still closed.
*  Are they opening those up?
*  I think they opened them up again.
*  We'll find that out next.
*  Oh, you can kite board.
*  Okay. Oh, meditation's allowed.
*  Oh, we're allowed to meditate.
*  What the fuck, man? Outdoor photography.
*  Oh, I didn't know.
*  I thought that if I was hiking, I couldn't take pictures of what I was hiking with.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you for allowing me to do outdoor photography.
*  Picnics with your stay at home household members only.
*  Can't meet up with other people that aren't sick.
*  What? Quad biking, rock climbing, roller skating, rollerblading.
*  It's weird because we're asking people to be extra super responsible with this.
*  Right?
*  But we don't ask the same thing about car accidents.
*  Look at it. Stop.
*  Go back.
*  Soft martial arts.
*  Look at that.
*  Tai Chi, Chi Kung.
*  What's Chi Kung?
*  Well, I know what Chi Kung is.
*  It's like a type of like a breathing exercise.
*  I'm pretty sure.
*  And you know what Tai Chi is.
*  It's almost like a series of rhythmic movements.
*  But why are you calling that a soft martial art?
*  That's such a weird definition and not in groups.
*  It's just so specific.
*  Like if a person wants to go outside and they have a shadow boxing routine they do
*  and they like to practice Muay Thai, why can't they go practice Muay Thai?
*  They can't just go outside.
*  Imagine like you're pent up in your apartment and you can go on the beach
*  and just like spark up a little and just throw some combinations under the sun and the sand.
*  You can't do that?
*  Is that threatening to people?
*  But you're allowed to do all this jazz?
*  That's not even a martial art.
*  Let's just be honest.
*  It's great.
*  People that do it, they find it very therapeutic and it's good for the body.
*  You know you're doing these slow poses so it gives you you know you're exercising control over your body.
*  But it's not really a martial art.
*  It's weird.
*  It's like you wouldn't fight with it.
*  So what is it?
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like you're not going to fight with Tai Chi.
*  I've never heard the terminology before.
*  Is there such thing as soft and hard martial arts?
*  Yeah, I guess you could.
*  Yeah, you could kind of define it like that.
*  Some people would say that Tai Chi is a soft martial art.
*  They would.
*  I guess they would kind of say it.
*  But it just doesn't make sense to me.
*  It's not a martial art.
*  A martial art is something that you would use in a fight.
*  If you're trying to have a thing with it.
*  There's rules to martial arts though.
*  So you could say like well how come boxing is just boxing?
*  How come they're not allowed to kick you or take you down?
*  Like is that a full martial art?
*  Like what is a martial art?
*  Martial arts are like doing the best shit to do when you're in war with a person, hand to hand combat.
*  But for so long we didn't know what the best shit was.
*  So they branched off into all these different groups.
*  So there's people that only concentrated on Judo.
*  And they were convinced that this is the best thing you could do.
*  I remember I was really foolish when I was doing Taekwondo.
*  And I worked out with my friend Walter.
*  He used to teach at this university.
*  And he was a bad motherfucker.
*  And I used to go down and train with him.
*  And there was this guy, there was this Judo guy who was there.
*  And they were practicing Judo.
*  And this guy was a gorilla.
*  He probably would have broken me in half and stuffed me up his ass.
*  I mean he really was a big guy.
*  But I thought God that's so useless.
*  This is what I thought.
*  I was like why would you want to do that?
*  When you could learn how to punch and kick.
*  Why would you want to learn how to do that?
*  Did you do any wrestling?
*  Yes. One year in high school.
*  But man until I started doing Jiu Jitsu.
*  I didn't realize how vulnerable I really was.
*  I hadn't done real martial arts in a long time.
*  Because I had a knee surgery.
*  And it took me a long time to recover.
*  More than a year.
*  I fucked my knee up.
*  And I didn't get it fixed for like six months.
*  And then I got it fixed.
*  It took like a year to rehab.
*  So for like a year and a half plus.
*  I wasn't doing any martial arts.
*  And then I started doing a little bit of kickboxing when I came to LA.
*  I went to this legendary place in Van Nuys.
*  It's one of the things that I wanted to go to.
*  Other than going to the comedy store.
*  I wanted to go to Benny the Jets Jet Center.
*  The Jet Center in Van Nuys.
*  Benny Orquidez.
*  He's like a legendary kickboxer from LA.
*  And him and his.
*  I believe Blinky Rodriguez is his brother-in-law.
*  But he was another beast.
*  He's a guy who knocked out one of the greatest kickboxers of all time.
*  Jean-Yves Therrien.
*  He knocked him out with a left hook.
*  I mean so this was a gym.
*  A legendary gym.
*  And I came here.
*  And right when I came here.
*  I started going there.
*  And they had earthquake damage.
*  So when it rained.
*  Their place got fucked up.
*  Like really fucked up.
*  And they had to close down.
*  And then he moved to a place in North Hollywood for a while.
*  But it just wasn't the same once that legendary gym was gone.
*  But those were one of the number one places that I wanted to come to when I came to LA.
*  Yeah.
*  Has anyone ever claimed Tai Chi or Chi Kung as any of their UFC skillset?
*  Yeah. They make stuff up for fun.
*  Look. Look. The greatest fighter of all time.
*  John Jones.
*  What's his style?
*  It says look see do.
*  That's his style.
*  Literally.
*  Go look up what John Jones fights.
*  Under his style.
*  He writes look see do.
*  You want to talk about a dude thinking for himself?
*  Yeah.
*  This guy's like.
*  Listen.
*  Fuck.
*  I know what I knew.
*  I know what I know.
*  I know what I can do.
*  I'm just going to call it look see do.
*  I look at people see things.
*  I look at people do something.
*  I see it.
*  And I do it.
*  One of the first fights ever in the UFC.
*  The guy tries to throw this wild spinning elbow.
*  Just out of nowhere.
*  Fights Shogun for the title.
*  Opens up with a flying knee.
*  Just wild.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Opens up on a legend.
*  Shogun was a legend.
*  UFC light heavyweight champion.
*  The guy who's knocked out Chuck Liddell.
*  Was fucking killing people in pride.
*  I mean when we were coming up.
*  Mauricio Shogun Hua was a legend.
*  John Jones fights him.
*  Wins the title.
*  The youngest guy ever to win a title in the UFC with a flying knee.
*  That's what he opens up with.
*  He's unbelievable.
*  Just wild man.
*  Just wild.
*  But anyway my point was I didn't realize how vulnerable I was.
*  Until I first started doing Jiu Jitsu.
*  When you were wrestling.
*  It would have been the same with wrestling.
*  Anybody who's a real grappler.
*  You can get really delusional about how much you can keep a person off you.
*  Anyone who's a real grappler.
*  A real division one wrestler.
*  What's frightening is how.
*  Then once you realize how hard it is.
*  But then you see the people who make it look so damn easy.
*  There were these wrestlers.
*  I think they were called the Hurley Twins or something.
*  From another school.
*  These guys were really really high level.
*  We were in high school.
*  But they were high level freestyle wrestlers.
*  They would go to the Nationals every year.
*  It appeared as though they would dangle guys by an angle.
*  And just keep getting points.
*  They would release.
*  They would make it look like it was nothing.
*  The other guy's wrestling for his life.
*  And they would just seamlessly grab their ankle and push them back.
*  There's an underappreciated skill level for the elite of the elite.
*  If you watch Jordan Burrows wrestle.
*  Who's currently right now today.
*  Widely considered to be the best wrestler in the world.
*  Or one of them.
*  There's a bunch of insanely good wrestlers out there.
*  I have a bunch of pairs of his shoes.
*  He's the elite of the elite.
*  When you watch him.
*  How good he is.
*  And how well he moves through these takedowns.
*  And transitions.
*  And chains takedown attacks together.
*  And the power and the drive.
*  And the fucking explosiveness.
*  All of it together.
*  The power of the elite, the power of the elite.
*  And the power of the elite to be and win.
*  You don't even know what that's like.
*  That guy manhandled Ben Askren.
*  Who manhandles most people.
*  They all know what he's gonna do.
*  They all know what to defend.
*  That he's going to shoot low on a double leg takedown.
*  And there's nothing they can do.
*  So good.
*  I mean Askren was quite a bit past his wrestling prime.
*  I don't think you can be elite at both.
*  I think most of these elite wrestlers.
*  Who are really really good wrestlers.
*  Once they get into the UFC and they realize how much striking they have to do how much submission they have to do
*  I think most of them would admit that they would they're probably
*  Not getting the same kind of focus on pure wrestling that allows them to stay at their highest level
*  So they might dip a little bit in their wrestling ability to pick up some skill and striking. It's a fine dance
*  They do man. Yeah, you know such a fine dance
*  And to put it all together. That's why looks he do is like such a great name for a style
*  Cuz he's not doing one thing. Yes, very good wrestler. Yes, very good striker
*  Yes, very good submission artists excellent at all those things, but he just throws them all together with whatever's there. What's open?
*  What's open? How about I'm never try to take you to the ground. I just kick the fuck out of your legs
*  I just get close to you beat you up in these in elbows
*  It's it's such a so when you say like when someone says martial art, like it's not a martial art
*  It's a style of fighting it's like a game you're playing
*  You know if you're if you're playing boxing you're playing boxing. It's it is definitely a fight, but it's it is a martial art
*  But it's not a complete one
*  like now that we know
*  Like all those little schools like the judo people and the taekwondo people that were all like real biased about their own style
*  Like I definitely was
*  Now you know that's one style. It's mixed martial arts
*  It's it's that look see do thing that John Jones does he does everything he's kicking you he's punching you
*  He's trying to take you down and smash you on the ground strangles you if he can like however I can beat you
*  That's what they're trying to do which is real martial arts
*  That's a real martial art like as close as you can get without eye gouging and going for the nuts because we all agree
*  That's just too much
*  Yeah
*  Even even though like if they're teaching you self-defense as the only time they step up with the eye gouge and the nut shots
*  But those are like the most effective moves eye gouging and nut shots are the most effective moves
*  We just collectively decide that they're too destructive
*  Yeah, it's weird seeing actual street fight videos. I saw one where the guy
*  Actual fight video where the guy does grab the other guy's nuts. It's like they're like in the army or something to oh Jesus
*  He's begging please like it's it's actually really fun. Oh my god, please please god. No, please
*  Oh my god, someone can crush your nuts and take away your manhood. Yeah, oh
*  My god, I've heard of dudes getting their nuts exploded nuts exploded from a kick one one guy who was sparring
*  Just like I think they said it was like his last round sparring
*  He said I fucking I don't need a cup just go like boom takes a shot to nuts and one of his balls explodes
*  Oh now no, they had to remove it. Oh, yeah, dude you you imagine the force of someone
*  Hitting you with a kick like imagine the force of someone who's like
*  Tyron Woodley who's an excellent leg kicker? He's got vicious power in his leg kicks the force of that hitting your nuts
*  Your nuts are not designed. You need a cup man. Yeah nuts are not designed to survive that with no help. That's crazy
*  That's why they gave us to just in case just in case because there's no kick that could blast through to it
*  There's a lot of kicks. It'll bust through two nuts
*  Wow, yeah 100%
*  Page or his oh if he if he kicked your nuts you would have no nuts. They would be all smashed up like gravy
*  It got kicked so hard I was looking at a hardened soft martial arts
*  Judo like that's judo. The Jew of judo and jiu-jitsu is soft
*  So it's like not that silly blocking with a block like blocking an attack with a bow
*  Like a redirection intercepting it yeah, well then you can't I don't know maybe I'm looking at the word soft incorrectly
*  Soft martial arts just has a picture of CM Punk next to it. Oh, it's you son of a bitch
*  You would never call judo a soft martial art though in I mean maybe it's technically that but I mean in
*  amongst the circles that I travel in when you're talking to and I'm not a judo expert obviously, but I'm not a
*  I know a lot of people that are I've talked to a lot of judo experts
*  I bet they wouldn't think it's soft martial art judo guys are brutal. They're brutal
*  they're some of the most is look if you watch like world-class judo like there's
*  some great footage of
*  Hector Lombard Hector Lombard when he's doing judo was a motherfucker. I mean, it's just
*  Smashing people he's so fucking strong when you watch like really good judo with really good technique
*  Something soft about that man that is wild shit man. Basically the art of throwing people
*  It's a art of throwing people on your fucking head
*  But in grabbing you by your clothes and you're both grabbing each other by your clothes when you get to a super elite level
*  When you watch those
*  Olympians go at it man, man. It's wild. It's so hard. It's a fucking hard
*  I mean, it's super brilliant and technical and it's very strategic and there's all these
*  Transitions it's very technical in terms of like being able to
*  Execute a high level throw on someone who's also an expert in high level throws
*  It's amazing, but it's also very hard like they're strong shit
*  It's not you know, like I've only rolled with a few like really good judo guys ever it's like rolling with a chimpanzee
*  They're too strong. Yeah, like wrestlers
*  judo guys
*  You guys are too fucking strong
*  Oh
*  We were still going over this list. That's how good this man robe on it is
*  I forgot what we're talking about. Oh, you can go tree climbing go try my climb a tree fuck. I did
*  I did the other day. I got climbed a tree. Hey, I'm excited good news
*  You can wash your car the government thinks it's okay for you to wash your car. Oh, you can walk the dog. Yeah
*  I didn't know I could walk the dog. I just been letting them shit in my mouth
*  For two months
*  You can watch the sunrise or the sunset Wow both of them yeah, we're so lucky you can do yoga
*  My goodness, I just let us be responsible
*  Silly list just you know that that list silly just just first of all that's a first draft
*  Edit take out sunrise and sunset. That's a big duh
*  You know take out a lot of the take out all the does
*  You like writing lists anybody writes a list like that. Yeah
*  Sweden's looking at that list and laughing all the way to the bank literally answer me this
*  How come you can play badminton like when you play in badminton sometimes like right up on each other
*  Aren't you yeah that far away? You can get close. I think
*  No, you don't right?
*  Do you spike it?
*  Well, but volleyball it has to be singles. Let's be one. I think they said single
*  Thing you're still touching this ball, so it's like touching someone's hands
*  It's the same thing if you have this and it's on the ball
*  It's gonna get on the ball when the person catches the ball. It's gonna get on their hands
*  They're gonna touch their eyes
*  They're gonna throw the ball again, and you're gonna do this for hours
*  You're gonna get each other's cooties you might as well just make out for sure you might as well just watch their sweat
*  Yeah, they sweat you're breathing hard you definitely get close to each other when you get real close to if you're like
*  I've seen dudes kiss they jumped up and as they were that's one of the main moves in volleyball
*  They give each other a kiss. Yeah, and they try to swap that ball down
*  Mean they might as well be kissing. That's how you start the game in
*  West Hollywood that would be a great way to fuck with your opponent
*  Yeah, as he's reaching up to get that ball you give him a smoocher right on the lips and like in a movie guys
*  peek up together
*  Imagine if that's all it took to turn you gay if there was a move
*  But imagine if a guy could make you gay if there was a thing, you know
*  Like how weird is that you can get knocked out?
*  Yeah getting knocked out is crazy the idea that you just get smacked on the face and you go unconscious and
*  Everything just shuts off. That would be hilarious
*  Imagine if there was like a button that you had like if someone touched a button like right right on your taint
*  it's like a reset button a
*  Electrical outlet the circuit blows you get to push it back in
*  But that volleyball scene isn't there a thing where Quentin Tarantino breaks down how gay this movie is
*  Like a video of it right he's gonna make a movie in space, of course, he's gonna make a movie in space
*  He's Tom fucking Cruz. Yeah, this is a if I was into gay men. This would be awesome
*  Right if you're a gay guy and you're like damn look at these guys. This is a movie for you. If you look at it that way
*  Also they slide into the sand and then miraculously right after they slide into the sand they are
*  Clean and shiny with glistening sweat and no sand on them
*  But watch they hit the sand all the time, but there's no sand on them instead they're perfectly glistening
*  This is a weird yeah, I don't think I've ever really watched Top Gun the whole way through hold on back that up
*  Why is Tom Cruise walk like that?
*  Back that up back that up
*  Watch this walk. Here we go
*  That's very odd
*  That's an odd walk. Maybe hurt himself out there volleyball injury, bro
*  He does all his own stunts to like motorcycle stunts. He's probably hurt all the time
*  He jumped out of a I watched the video they have video of him being
*  Videoed while jumping out of that plane and mission impossible. Yeah, what is that? What is that?
*  Nuts the video of him hanging on the plane. What does he do in there?
*  Is he attached by a latch or something? Have you seen that shit?
*  There's a video of him and supposedly it's actual video of him hanging from the side of the plane
*  This he doesn't get enough credit for this. He's a goddamn maniac
*  This look he's giving them the thumbs up and so this fucking plane takes off dude
*  And he's actually hanging off the edge of this. Look at this watch. He lets his legs go and everything
*  This is nuts man, look at this
*  This is insane. So he's really letting this plane take him in the air and he's hanging on from the power of L Ron Hubbard
*  Look at this. No, there it is. You can see it. What what are you seeing? There's a there's a thing right there
*  You see that rope the rope?
*  Yeah, no rope is connecting him. Yeah, but still that's him. That's nuts
*  That's crazy. I'm not saying this is the only thing keeping him up there
*  I'm saying what the fuck man
*  That's what the fuck man, he's strapped to the side of a plane and he's Tom Cruise
*  He's like a huge movie star. I'm like what kind of insurance policy was involved in this scene?
*  When he broke his ankle they stopped for like six weeks. I think bro if I was the director
*  I'd say look we're gonna shoot this scene last
*  I
*  Would write in fake endings to the movie where Tom Cruise's character dies and then his sister comes in I would have Scarlett Johansson on
*  Standby ready to come avenge Tom Cruise because we see him fly off the back of that plane and that would be a real
*  Controversy thing like should we actually show him falling off the plane to his death and they'd be like look Tom would want us to
*  And so they leave it in there and we all get to watch like a Tom Cruise snuff film. I
*  Love that we would love that
*  People love that the thing is people would what I would watch it
*  I don't want it to happen
*  But I would if I knew there was a video of Tom Cruise dying
*  Because he fell off the side of a plane
*  How do you not watch that?
*  Right. Yeah, how do you not watch that?
*  I mean look look at it look at what he fledger died basically from playing the Joker that whole time
*  He's on the pills and everything. He can't sleep. We all everybody went and watched that
*  That's not why he died you think like he got addicted to pills because of the Joker
*  Well, no, he just wasn't sleeping. He wasn't taking care of himself through the entire filming of that movie
*  They didn't even finish it right I don't think so. I think he died right at the end of filming
*  Oh not positive on that. Yeah, I think you're right. I feel like he died during the process, right? Yeah
*  That was a bummer man. That guy can act his ass off. You gotta assume no
*  I always do when someone's that good at something. They're probably just
*  Just really chaotic. You know mentally chaotic and some of those people just need to calm that fucking demon down
*  Okay, so he did so he was done and he was on the next thing like John Belushi, right?
*  Here's another one. You see that guy like he was he was so
*  Ferocious in some of his characters, you know, he was so wild
*  like
*  They must have been demons demons
*  I'll name another one right now Phillips. He must have been demons
*  Like
*  They must have been demons
*  Demons, I'll name another one right now Philip Seymour Hoffman. Oh, oh my god
*  I really watched one I hadn't seen with him nuts man done by the
*  He did one with the guy that made there will be blood that director. I can't remember the name of it
*  He's in those Hunger Games, right? Yeah, but he's good at knows. Yeah, he's I know those movies are silly
*  Philip Seymour Hoffman's freak. He was really good. Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean he's got an impressive list if you look at the movies that he's done you go over you go
*  Oh, wow, I forgot about that one. I forgot about that one
*  Yeah, and he makes even the ones that look like they'd be lame. I went down
*  This is when the quarantine started. This is one of the big rabbit holes
*  I went down was a Philip Seymour Hoffman one and even the movies that look like they wouldn't be great are great
*  there's a few actors that really I think read the scripts that they're offered and
*  Have a real take on them that then they make everything good that Ben Mendelsohn guy
*  I don't know if you've ever saw bloodline, but he's another one of those
*  Is he that guy that was in 30 days nights?
*  There's a guy who's in 30 days of nights
*  Which is a really fun vampire movie while you're quarantined good fuck. Have you seen it? No, no, he's the guy from the outsider. Oh
*  Cop from the outsider show me
*  Oh
*  That guy's amazing. You can look up anything. He's done. It's unbelievable
*  Yeah, he was in ready player one. He was the bad guy remember he was great in that
*  He's an unbelievable bad guy. So he's so good as the cop in the outsider. The outsider is really fun
*  I really enjoyed that. I hope they make a part two of that
*  That was creepy as fuck and that woman who played the savant she played the sort of autistic savant that guy
*  That lady was amazing. She was so good like that whole cast
*  The guy who is her boyfriend in that who was also from house of cards. Yeah, that guy's amazing
*  So that was a great little fun supernatural series. Yeah for sure
*  I bet yeah that lady who played the autistic one like I wonder what she's like in real life because she's so good
*  Completely different. I actually found this out because I was her name
*  Let's find out
*  She's amazing
*  She played it perfect. Like that's a weird read to play a super genius
*  Who's on the spectrum? You know, that's a weird read but she like but also relatable and really likable
*  She's just figured out the perfect
*  Perfect frequency, you know, some people can play a psycho and you're like god damn that seems psycho
*  Like the old lady on
*  Ozark the old lady who grows the heroin my god shit. Is she good?
*  Holy shit is that lady good? Who is that lady?
*  She's amazing. She's careful fuck out of me. She scares the fuck out of me
*  So Cynthia
*  Erivo is the the woman who plays the autistic lady on the outsider
*  Who is the lady now that plays the heroin lady in Ozark?
*  Lady is scary man. She's fucking terrified
*  She's for sure the most terrifying person in a show filled with terrifying people
*  She scares me more than the Navarro guy does. Yeah. Oh
*  She's completely crazy. She's so scary dude. She killed her own husband
*  I don't know but she's so believable that lady who's the actress is fucking brilliant. What is her name? Just go to cast
*  That scene with when she started banging the kid
*  reminded me of remember the scene in Kingpin where
*  He has to have sex with the neighbor. She plays Darlene
*  That's her name, right? Isn't it Darlene?
*  right
*  Yes, that's the lady Lisa Emory
*  Okay, dude, she's incredible. She's so scary
*  She's so scary on that show and the other woman the lawyer woman she scares the fuck out of me too Helen
*  God damn it. Who's that lady?
*  That lady's amazing as well
*  She's terrifying
*  The bet they steal the show that's a one of the interesting things about Ozark is
*  You want to talk about a show that's like an equal opportunity show
*  It's a terrifying show and the two scariest characters are women. Yeah
*  It's a great show
*  And it's funny because you know, it's written and directed by Jason Bateman and when I first visited California the first time I was
*  They just graduated high school and I was out here visiting my brother and we got lost
*  We were in this SUV and we got lost going around the Hollywood Hills and at one point my brother
*  Stops to ask for directions somehow we got like it's like looking back on it's like you just go down the hill, right?
*  But we didn't know what side we were on
*  Anyway, he stops to ask this guy that's walking on the side of the street. Who's clearly on the cell phone
*  Which way to get back down? He's like, excuse me, sir. Excuse me
*  This guy turns around and it was Jason Bateman and Jason Bateman's on his phone
*  And he looks back at my brother and he goes like he's looking at my brother like can't you see like he didn't say a word
*  But he looks at his phone. I can't you see I'm on the phone. Like what are you idiot?
*  and but he didn't say anything he just looked at his phone and looked at us like that and
*  And kept walking went back on his phone call. So after that, I'm like, you know what screw that Jason Bateman guy
*  Like I was never I didn't really find none of the that one sitcom
*  He was on never really connected with me or whatever
*  And so I always thought I was anti Jason Bateman and then here we are
*  So much later almost 20 years later, and I realized that day that we were the assholes
*  Stopping of course, we saw that he was on the phone in retrospect if anybody did that to me or anyone
*  I know we would do the same can't you see I'm on the phone
*  Looks like Sebastian exactly. Oh, oh you got to pull up this video from Sebastian's Instagram
*  He's walking and these people are walking up the hill behind him with water bottles on their heads
*  It is the most Sebastian thing you'll ever see in your life. It's brilliant
*  This is if someone's want to say like hey, that's Sebastian. He's really funny, right? What's this comedy like?
*  Watch this video. It is
*  Give me some volume
*  That is so stupid he's laughing while he's saying it it's a hundred percent his personality you bother me
*  He kills me harder than almost anybody in the world he's very funny in a very unique way
*  He's very funny in his own way like he's like Theo in a lot of ways
*  Like if someone said like how do you describe Theo's comment like is he's Theo Vaughn?
*  He's just got he knows how to be Theo Vaughn and it's amazing and Sebastian. It's real similar in that way
*  It's he knows how to be Sebastian. He's got that
*  He just is himself and it just it works you can't you couldn't write it down on paper
*  So weird one of the weirder things about comedy
*  Yeah, like some of those people that are like that Harlan Williams to tell me what that is explain that to me
*  Yeah, you can't explain it. You just got to see it and then you'll be laughing
*  Hey there butter nuts flapjacks peachy pie. You know, what the fuck like I get nervous around Sebastian
*  He's one of the only people I'm more comfortable around Chappelle than I am around Sebastian like it's literally
*  There's just something about his entire aura. Like I'm always afraid I'm gonna say something or do something stupid or trip
*  Yeah
*  You worried about that?
*  Comedic observation what? Yeah, what the he's so fucking funny to me
*  I think I was such a nice guy too. Like just such a sweetheart of a guy always has been always been a nice guy
*  That was hustled that Italian like those Italian stories and delivery take me hit me
*  It's like it's like I almost feel like I'm related to him and he's just this funny guy
*  Did I tell you what happened with his cousin? Uh-uh, dude
*  So somebody tells me hey
*  I heard Sebastian's house got robbed and I'm like what so I text him and he said no
*  it's actually my cousin has exact same name as me and two guys broke into his house and
*  He fought one of them on a security camera and then went inside and shot the other one killed the guy
*  yeah, the guy I mean the guy pulled a gun on him in his fucking house and so
*  He the guy who he beat up gets charged for murder
*  Wow, because when you commit a crime and it causes someone to die you get charged
*  For for the for the actual death. Isn't that crazy?
*  Wow cousin of comic Sebastian Manasalco and there's video of these guys breaking into his door
*  It's really crazy like you can see the video of he comes storming out with the guy and he's fighting with this home invader guy
*  And meanwhile, there's another guy inside his house with his family. So here he is. He's fighting with this guy
*  He's got no shoes on right? So it looks like he has no shoes on right?
*  He's just beating the fuck out of this guy and apparently he
*  Practices martial arts. He's a big looks-he-do
*  Practitioner. Yeah, it's not that so he goes inside that he beats the fuck out of that guy that guy runs off
*  he goes inside and
*  Then he kills a guy. I believe he took the guy's gun from him and shot him. I think that's what happened
*  I'm not sure though
*  So I believe somebody told me that well, how did the guy die?
*  See if you could find it. Did they think that it was?
*  Sebastian man at scalco. Well somebody did that's why they contacted me and they said hey Sebastian's house got broken into I was like what?
*  So I called him I
*  Texted him the whole thing is really crazy though
*  Okay
*  He followed the wife and the two children up to the second floor bedroom with his gun drawn prosecutor said
*  The the general the the bad guy brought that brodax
*  Broke through the bedroom door pushed the children onto the bed and pointed the gun at Manasakal's wife as she begged him not to shoot
*  Prosecutor said after Manasakal chased off the first guy
*  Fennan he retrieved his own gun and fatally shot Brodax in the abdomen. Wow
*  Jesus Christ, so the guy had a gun pointed at his family
*  Pointed at his family
*  And he used his own gun. Oh, yeah, it's in Illinois. So that's where he's originally from
*  They must have thought it was actually Sebastian Manasakal the comedian
*  The other guy has been captured and faces murder charges under an Illinois statute that allows for such crimes to be leveled against suspects
*  If they take part in a felony offense that leads to another person's death
*  man
*  Crazy fuck man, you know, and that's why people have guns, you know, and nobody wants to hear that story
*  You don't want to hear that story because that story is a pro gun story
*  You know, it's anti gun because someone tried to rob the guy's house with gun
*  But it's pro gun in if he didn't have a gun what would have happened
*  You saw that yeah, it's anti gun because someone used a gun in a robbery
*  But it's pro if he didn't have a gun, maybe his family would be dead
*  Do you see you have to be able to see both sides
*  Because the gun control argument is such a weird one people like they dig heels in left people dig on this side
*  They have like a set of beliefs that you're allowed to have and then the people on the right dig on another side
*  You know, the Second Amendment is right. It's not a privilege
*  You know, we own this and this is in the media definitely doesn't cover it when it goes
*  Right. No, well, they did here because it's Sebastian's cousin, right?
*  But it's not like if it went the other way, you know, if some people got shot to death inside their home
*  It would be an anti gun argument
*  You know I'm saying which is interesting because if you have a gun like he did
*  The people broke into his house and he was able to protect his family. That's the best case scenario for gun ownership
*  well
*  the best case scenario is never having to use it and the next best is
*  Being able to use it to protect your family because that's what it's there for so it's actually a pro gun story
*  It's a it's an anti gun it would it would be an anti gun story if he didn't have a gun
*  That's what's crazy. If he didn't have a gun and the guy shot his family
*  It would be an anti gun story, but because he had a gun, it's a pro gun story. Isn't that interesting? Yeah
*  So saw the one with the church where the guy went in for like a mass shooting and the guy
*  Standing against the back wall the church had a gun too and just got him right away. Yeah
*  Yeah, an arm trained man with a gun
*  I know a guy in Vegas. He got carjacked recently and
*  He's a I mean he's he's like a competitive shooter
*  I mean he he has videos of him practicing shooting with pistols of marksman
*  Incredible fast draw and he killed this guy in a gunfight
*  Like that's a pro gun story I pulled a gun on him
*  And he could have lost his life instead. He survived because he had a gun
*  it's
*  It's one of those things guns are like one of those things like being a person. It's being a person's weird
*  It's all sorts. It's not clear. We're not numbers, right?
*  This is a little it fluctuates what we are the way we live fluctuates right now. Things are weird
*  Almost all of our decisions that we have to make about everything. I like well if we just open up the country
*  We're gonna lose a lot of people, you know
*  We should maybe hold it back and then the other argument if we don't open up the country
*  We're gonna lose a lot of people
*  So what are we gonna do?
*  We're gonna let the people die because it's despair and homelessness and and suicide drug addiction because they've lost everything
*  There's gonna be those two like it's like everything else man like all all things involving people
*  I like it's like well, there's this and that it's there's a lot of stuff like this
*  That people want to have like a definitive answer like, you know is are we waiting too long to open up?
*  Is Florida jumping in too quick who's right who's wrong? We don't fucking know
*  Yeah, these are educated guesses, but it's just one of those things like being a person
*  When things get started up again, and no one knows what the future is gonna be
*  There's just a lot of predicting we're not right all the time
*  It's just especially scary because the news is so picky and choosy and weird about how they're covering things
*  They it seems like it's almost all bad news now on the cable news programs
*  Yeah, and if well, that's where they get the most money. It's like they're being rewarded for it
*  But I mean I understand from their perspective is that they only have an hour and there's a lot of fucking bad news
*  You know when you're getting all the bad news from seven billion people plus around the world
*  It's got a lot of it's gonna suck
*  You only have an hour things are happening 24 hours a day. The news itself is like a show is really preposterous
*  Yeah, like we're gonna condense it all into an hour, but isn't it the real stuff that's happening?
*  How can it be condensed at all and do you not do you have to do that anymore?
*  Do you know like when they have this guy has this show and that guy has that show and the show goes for an hour
*  and they're gonna cover these details and show you went went wrong like
*  There's so many things that went wrong
*  Yeah
*  If you just want to concentrate on things that went wrong you could do it 24 hours a day and never run out of material
*  But you gotta almost kind of is that the world is it things that went wrong
*  Is that the world or is the world like a lot of shit that went right like when we're hearing the news all they really
*  Want to discuss is the things that are gonna freak you the fuck out
*  There's not a whole lot dedicated to making you feel good about our prospects, right?
*  There's not a whole it's like it does control a lot of how the the people who watch it think about things because they're really
*  Influential they're wearing makeup. There's a spotlight on them and it says news and it has a ticker
*  And you're saying we're meant to believe that we can trust them good lord
*  It's hard to trust anybody
*  It's hard to trust anybody when things are weird
*  You know, you don't know who's telling the truth
*  Like oh my god, there's so many different things that are going on all at once right now, right?
*  They try to figure out if the disease came from a lab, you know
*  Did they accidentally?
*  release this thing
*  China's mad at us and we're mad at China and all these countries are gonna sue China like there's so many things
*  That are bouncing around in
*  Sort of the global consciousness. Do you have to pay attention to her Kim Jong-un was sick?
*  Oh my god, he might die. They flew in Chinese doctor. His sister might take over. Ooh
*  And then we got to pay attention sister. She looks mean man
*  The sister looks mean like that kind of stuff is that get if you if you absorb what's in the media
*  That kind of stuff will literally change the way you view the world and that will change
*  The way you act in the world and that will literally make things suck
*  It'll make things suck more if you go out and only concentrate on things that are terrible
*  another show that's up there with those arcs for me now is
*  Succession and that is about a very rich family that owns their own cable news channel. Oh god and
*  Very very interesting to see from that perspective not to say that it's completely accurate
*  but I
*  Mean they have control if they want something promoted or left out
*  It's just that easy
*  Like you said they're smashing it all into an hour even though it keeps running but like an hour program
*  It's so easy just to decide what you leave out does so much
*  For something or a story or a product or a stock or anything that you invest in or
*  Own yourself or anything like that. Yeah, and
*  Yeah, successions a really great one for sort of it's almost like a house of cards
*  Esque view how they view how they let you into the presidency
*  They let you into a cable news
*  Network like they had that one with Jeff Daniels the newsroom or whatever, but that was sort of janky
*  Oh, yeah, that was the one he would go on these rants. Yeah, they're pretty good
*  But a guy rants that well all the time like hey, bro, you plan this
*  Like what kind of human being do you want to hear go on these perfectly worded rants all the time
*  You know
*  It was that weird like that was his thing like that was his soft kung fu. His soft martial art was these rants
*  He would bust him out like Tai Chi in the park and you'd be like, come on. No one talks like this
*  You have conversations with people you don't just go on these crazy rants, right? Yeah
*  Isn't an interesting little try that with a character when a guy's really good at rants like you just do this all the time
*  Like every movie with Al Pacino has to have some kind of
*  Right always that's part of who he is yeah, he's the guy that has a monologue where everybody's standing around going
*  And they'll start yelling at you. You ever seen the devil or whatever
*  Yeah, I was gonna say the devil's advocates the best one of that because he literally just gets crazier and crazier
*  I wish we could play it. I wish we could play it
*  Yeah
*  He was a fucking wizard man who was better in his prime than Al Pacino think about Scarface. God damn
*  Yeah, have you seen the Irishman? No, I haven't seen it
*  They got bad rough reviews, but I loved it man. I was shocked because I had super low expectations
*  I actually put it on thinking I was gonna like fall asleep or something
*  It was one of those where I'm like, I'm just gonna throw this on I heard it wasn't that great
*  Oh, and I was up the whole time. I was amped dude. If you love Martin Scorsese, you're going to love this movie
*  It's like Scorsese doing up his you know, it's just great plus Sebastian's in it
*  Al Pacino destroys is that Jerry Seinfeld's brother? Look at this cast
*  I
*  Kills it look he looks so weird with that outfit on I didn't even recognize him
*  That's a weird picture and he's in the dark. I didn't watch it. I'll watch it. I did hear some fucked up reviews
*  Oh, you know what?
*  I'm glad I heard bad reviews before watching this because it really lowered my expectations and I spent the whole time going
*  This is some this is so great. Is that that was why they say it was bad. What were they saying was bad about it?
*  I just heard bad. Isn't that funny? How easy you are to
*  Convince like I I really didn't look into it. I didn't ask my friends, right? I was like, oh someone said it's bad. Yeah
*  Sebastian Sebastian
*  Crazy crazy Joe Gala that's oh does he really opposite of the character you guys are saying like he's such a nice guy
*  Wow, he's not too silly at all in this movie plays a fucking badass, which is so cool
*  I love a wing comedians can have those
*  Contrasting characters. Yeah. Well Jim Carrey did that a lot, right Jim Carrey played some crazy characters
*  Yeah, the cable well the cable guy was still pretty funny. It's still kind of funny, but it was real dark
*  The Truman show was a good one. That's a good one. Yeah. Yeah, that was a real good one
*  That is everybody's life now
*  Everybody with Instagram live that's their life now, you know, that's a great movie to
*  Rewatch and look at all the little details where all the little cameras are why they're showing you things the Truman shows a smart cool movie
*  I just found I was looking into the guy that wrote it
*  He wrote some cool movies that we've talked almost similarly about Gattaca like the topics of the guy Wow
*  Really cool movie. If you've never seen it called Lord of War with Nicolas Cage where he plays like arms dealer. Yeah
*  I think I saw that. Yeah, no shit. Yeah
*  Nicholas Cage gonna play Joe Exotic
*  I
*  Love it. I they need to speed this up and just get it done figure out a way, please
*  God, please God put these camera men in hazmat suits and film it. I just want Joe exotic to be let out of jail
*  That's what I want. We need a season two
*  Come on Trump. Let's go
*  Pardon that dude. I'm not buying it. I think they railroaded them for sure the guy admits it that other
*  That other zoo owner guy admits it yeah, yeah, you said they railroaded him right? Yeah, it's all it's all weird man
*  Like he definitely did a lot of stupid shit
*  You know, he definitely terrorized that lady
*  But it seems like she might have killed her husband too. Yeah, that seems like that's a possibility
*  They need to open that case. Well, it seems like
*  It's the only thing everybody on that show agrees on it once someone just disappears like that
*  Is that really the picture?
*  Well, that's it Nicholas Cage from a long time ago son. He doesn't look that good right now
*  Yeah, that's probably 15 20 years old
*  That's crazy he's gonna be perfect for that role
*  Remember him in
*  Raising Arizona
*  Fucking great. So good. He was great in that movie. That is a great movie. That's a fun fucking movie
*  Raising, Arizona
*  What is from the con air
*  The world of blockbuster movies what a weird world that must be being one of them guys I
*  Can't wait to see that. I wonder how they're gonna play that
*  Or write that it's not gonna be as good as the real thing, right? Let him out of jail
*  Yeah, come on pedal get together all your Netflix money. Yeah hire a good lawyer. Let him out of jail
*  He was just impossible to stop watching he feels bad and he won't do it again
*  Let him out
*  Let him out and let's see what kind of straight guys he can convert. The guy must be some sort of hypnotist
*  Heck yeah, he's like a gay guy and a homophobe at the same time
*  He's a gun toting a gun he's got his own zoo
*  He's a tough guy in the middle of Oklahoma that is gay as hell, bro
*  He held it together when that cat was dragging him by his foot
*  He pulled off his gun and he shot and didn't even shoot the cat
*  He shot and shot away from the cat
*  Yeah
*  Like that that is a person who knows that a handle shit under pressure in front of a camera in front of a camera
*  You can almost hear him say goddamn line if this if they weren't filming this
*  He's got to be aware of how famous he is right now, right? Yeah, yeah, I don't think he really really knows
*  He probably has an idea, but he's not out right if he was I bet the guards taunt him. Hey, bro
*  You're like the most famous guy in America. Here's your fucking lunch
*  This slides over some terrible meatloaf. Yeah. Mmm got him in solitary. I
*  Don't know man. She had a husband that just disappeared and she conveniently left him
*  He conveniently left her rather the whole business all the money
*  All of his documents had been altered
*  Prior previous to his death like there's so much of it that you're like what and she oh she has like a hundred tigers
*  Whatever whatever that's not even I mean the guy's missing she's devastated
*  Yeah, you imagine your wife chopping you up feeding you to a fucking pit full of tigers like a Conan movie
*  What better way to get rid of a body really?
*  pigs
*  Yeah, yeah pigs who probably don't wouldn't leave any of it
*  Maybe I mean, you know cats might do it too. Eventually they might chew through the bones. I wonder if they do that
*  Wolves definitely do wolves chew right through bones, which is really crazy if you think about it like they're chewing through like a moose bone
*  Yeah, the tiger park reopened over the weekend to congratulations
*  large crowds
*  Gw's of course. Yeah, really fucking huge now. It's like it's a reality show
*  I saw an article where the lady that got her arm bitten off in that documentary man you piece of shit
*  Oh it is yes. Oh Jesus Christ. You just misgendered her. I apologize to the zookeeper there
*  Everyone Tony's been under a lot of stress. He's been trapped at home. He hasn't done stand-up in six weeks
*  He didn't mean it, but I saw an article where that just came out yesterday that said
*  That she thinks the zoos shouldn't open because the Tigers could give it to each other
*  Like they don't have a way of distancing the Tigers
*  Lol and I thought to myself even know if it goes to Tigers
*  That's no that's that's I mean there was a there was one thing that said that it did that one tested positive
*  I wonder if it how it affects them
*  Yeah, maybe they just carry it and it doesn't affect them. I
*  Don't know. Well, I was I was telling you Jamie what we were talking about this before the the different groups of people that
*  in the weirdest weirdest way are
*  Asymptomatic
*  That thing that I sent you I said did I send that to you Jamie?
*  Let me pull it up. One of them was about I think it was a meatpacking plant and they had some insane number of
*  Employees tested positive all of them asymptomatic
*  Let me see I know I have it in here somewhere if you just give me a second I'll find it
*  I
*  Got a pork plant in Missouri
*  Yes, that's exactly where it is and that's the place Missouri just opened up concerts. They're like, let's do it. Oh, so
*  So here it is
*  370 workers at a pork plant in Missouri tested positive for coronavirus. All of them were asymptomatic
*  all of them
*  That is the work of a boss that gets everybody to work and tells them all to lie
*  You never had any symptoms
*  Mmm, that could be true, huh? Right? That's possible
*  That's totally possible. That's totally possible
*  Yeah, you got to take that into consideration all get in trouble
*  But if they were all there and they tested them
*  Would they have been able to tell if any of them were exhibiting any symptoms?
*  Yeah, that might be a thing right they might be influenced to not say it it's hard to say yeah
*  You know when you look at something at that, that's a good point. You nailed it there, dude
*  We look at something that wild like all of you. Yeah, no one felt anything and still worked
*  If not, we all need to move to yeah, right
*  Huh
*  Yeah, you can't tell right you can't tell like you can't just say and the other one was prisoners
*  There was a group of prisoners that I'll see if I could find you
*  Pull that article up for you a group prisoners and they tested them and some insane number like 96% of them
*  Tennessee yeah percent tested
*  but
*  98% were asymptomatic so I
*  was thinking about this and
*  God forget who I was talking to this
*  About this they were talking about I think was Kyle Kulinski. We're talking about
*  Your immune system that your immune system when you're in a place like a prison is probably super strong
*  Because there's so many people around you. You're always interacting with all this different bacteria. Whereas if you just like
*  Live by yourself in an apartment like you've quarantine for these five weeks
*  And then you're gonna go back out into the world your immune system is like
*  Your cardiovascular system. It's like you don't use it. So because you don't use it. It's weak, right your cardiovascular system
*  If you're exercising all the time you boost your capacity and he was thinking that like that's probably what it's like in prison, too
*  It's like oh
*  That makes a lot of sense
*  Like we would think the prison would be really unhealthy and it probably is for your mind
*  But for your in your body because you're getting shitty food, but for your immune system
*  It might actually be quite a workout, right? Yeah, as long as you get enough nutrition
*  They probably have to feed them some sort of balanced diets, right I
*  Mean I would imagine how bad do you think prison food is pretty bad? Yeah
*  Like are there requirements what kind of nutrition they have to provide to them?
*  That's weird. Yeah, like how bad I mean it must be terrible who's complaining
*  Like if they're complaining this food sucks like no one hearing you bro. Yeah, you're inside a cage. You don't get a cell phone
*  You don't get nothing
*  You get to go outside and make calls that lasts like seven minutes and then you're gonna put more coins in do it again
*  And you stand there in the hallway having these conversations. He's once a week conversations with your friends
*  crazy crazy
*  What's fucked up about prison is like I don't think it works, you know
*  It's like I don't want to compare people to dogs, but I'm gonna
*  We've talked about this before that like if you get a dog and I've rescued dogs that were just
*  They were older and they'd seen too much shit by the time you get to them, they're all fucked up
*  you know, they're the growl of people a snap of people like
*  You got a rescue dog. You want to bite people you can't you know
*  You want a puppy so that when you raise the puppy you could teach the puppy that you love it
*  And this is family and everybody's cool and you got to listen to the rules though
*  You can't shit in the house you can't and then you teach it and then it becomes like this
*  I think in a way, it's really hard training an older dog
*  I know some people are experts at it, but I think they just don't want to learn and
*  Their life has just been fucked over by people and if you get out like a seven-year-old eight-year-old pound dog
*  It's been abused like oh
*  Fuck that poor dog. They don't want and it's almost like with some humans the abuse that life throws at us
*  From the time you're young
*  you're kind of like trying to deal with it as you get older and maybe fix yourself and
*  Try to like balance your your own self out, but every now and then you'll forget
*  How easy you have it in comparison to some people if you see some people's lives?
*  Where it's just poverty and crime and like fucking everyone around them was either a criminal or
*  Or on drugs, and it's like fucking everywhere. You look you see despair. You don't see any happiness
*  For someone to come through that to have the same expectations as they have someone who came through
*  Even like my childhood which was not that bad my childhood was a little weird, but it wasn't bad
*  No one was you know no one was abusive to me
*  When someone's abusive to you, and then all of a sudden you find yourself you're 32 and you're trying to get your shit together
*  But you just your visions of being raped or beaten by your uncles and you know whatever the fuck it is that that's inside your head
*  They're just like all day to find you yeah
*  it's
*  It's so hard for people to get through that
*  Hard for people to turn gears you know it's so hard for people that have just said you know what I'm just gonna numb myself
*  With pills. I'm just gonna like those guys. I'm just gonna numb myself. It's so hard for those guys to get out of that
*  It's so hard to go no
*  I'm gonna run every day and eat healthy food, and I'm gonna drink only water that's hard
*  That's way harder than just taking oxys
*  So so many people just want to slide if you meet a guy
*  He's like 31, and he's taking oxys like how much can you change him like you almost want you have to be so
*  so driven to change yourself and
*  A lot of people just aren't
*  Yeah, it's it's hard to it's hard to do that stuff if you're not in the routine of doing that anyway
*  Exercise and drink water just be healthy. Yeah, sleeper. It's hard. It's fucking hard to do. It's hard to not be self-destructive
*  Yeah, but with people the crazy thing is sometimes they can do it sometimes you can get a guy
*  Who's 32 hooked on heroin and then ten years later?
*  He's running marathons and writing books and super positive eating eating healthy and now he has a family
*  He's a different person that does happen too. That's the thing about people
*  It's like some of us get through like how many people run a hundred miles not many
*  But I know like three or four
*  You know like it's not it's not there's not that many but some people do it and I almost think like getting your shit
*  Together is a lot like running a hundred miles
*  Like everyone can do it if you just force yourself to do it, but it's fucking hard to run a hundred miles
*  I can only imagine how hard I've never done it. I would imagine fucking hard to run a hundred miles
*  What's fucking hard to get your life together to both things are hoppin some people do them
*  Less people run a hundred miles then get their shit together though
*  So it seems to be easier than running a hundred miles by my measurements. Yeah
*  Still hard though. It's fucking hard. It's hard to run a mile for sure
*  Tell people to run a mile most people just like what a mile no problem bitch go run a mile go run a mile not shuffle
*  Not not little no I want you to move your body. I want you spring bounce spring bounce. Let's keep going one mile
*  It's hard it's not easy and it changes depending on anything as easy as your last meal
*  Yeah, no, oh dude get a bowl of spaghetti and try to go for a run especially like meatballs
*  Those are breaded meatballs. Oh my god. That's another thing. I've I've
*  I've gotten better at during this cooking. Oh, dude. I do I gotta give you some milk. Yes, absolutely
*  Please do all I want is pictures take pictures for sure take some food porn for me. Absolutely ready to go
*  I actually fucking
*  There's this farmers market right by where I live
*  original LA farmers market and so they have like multiple butcher shops and I was going to um, I
*  was going to different ones when this whole thing first started and trying out different things and different combinations of
*  Basically remaking each week my mom's meat sauce
*  Which is different than a regular sauce that has meatballs and this and that
*  Anyway and I kept testing out these different concoctions and one time I nailed it and it really tasted like hers
*  And I went back to that butcher shop and did it again and I said to the guy I go
*  Yeah, that stuff I made last week came out just like my mom's and he goes where you from
*  I said Youngstown and it turns out that that butcher shop
*  Was and is from originally there and that it is the same. It's basically the same
*  Stuff it's all the same like meat or cut or whatever they do or how they do it was the same thing
*  So what are you putting in your their sauce? Like how do you do when we say meat sauce?
*  Is using ground beef? Are you using a percentage of ground beef basically like 50% ground beef?
*  25% hot ground up Italian sausage and 25% pork Wow. You have a formula
*  Oh, yeah, baby, and it's been something that I've been tweaking here and there it comes out fucking
*  Good now, I so you're getting all the food all the meat from this one place
*  Well, I now I get my sausage and my pork from there and the ground beef from the other place
*  I have it all figured out now, so you're like getting deep into this shit. Oh, yeah. What else you cooking?
*  Well, I mean really I'm I'm a big sucker for pasta
*  So it's like a lot of different types of sauces and experimentations like thought the vodka sauce with like a pinker sauce
*  And do you think people hate you because you're so slim and beautiful and yet you eat pasta all day
*  I mean if they only knew how much pasta I
*  Eat so much pasta. It's crazy. I eat pasta like a fucking one of those TLC shows
*  Like people can't get out of bed without eating pasta. I am I am an 800 pound man in this fucking toothpick body
*  You're a great eater when we do shows that eat after shows you eat like a motherfucker
*  Always proud of myself when I take down more than you I'm always like, yeah, I'm a real fucking man
*  My man, you know who can eat us both on the table who could literally eat the same amount both of us would eat
*  Yeah, Ari Shafir at FOGO to chow because it's like it's not free, you know you pay but right
*  It's all you can eat to get my money's worth. Well for him. I'm serious if the food keeps coming
*  He's gonna keep eating
*  Yeah
*  If it doesn't cost anything because it's green when you want to go like when you want to keep they come around with these plates
*  full of all this crazy meats and
*  Sausages and chicken legs and all this different stuff and they just keep coming and you can just take as much as you want
*  And then when you got to tap out you flip your coin over to red. He's so cheap. He takes that coin with him
*  Are he just eats he just eats it's great we're stunned afterwards everyone's sitting around Joey Diaz is done. I'm done Duncan's done
*  We're staring at him. He's like, I'm not gonna stop. Why should I stop? They're gonna keep bringing it
*  Yeah, if you keep bringing it I'm gonna keep eating it
*  It's so good. He just kept chowing like a wolf. Yeah
*  Fill himself up
*  That's the food. That's that that I'll feel more of an impact by eating a couple pounds of meat like that
*  Than I will from all the pasta in the world interesting FOGO to chow slows me down for the evening
*  I've learned that if I have FOGO to chow for lunch, I
*  Like I don't do it on a night where I have to work which is obviously most nights but now not but anyway
*  That's the one that would affect me is just a lot of meat see for me. It's totally the opposite
*  Yeah, for whatever reason like when I eat I love pasta too, man. I love it. It's so good
*  So many different kinds too and they all do different things like a angel hair is great for some things
*  You know what? I like there's this twisty pasta. It's like long like spaghetti
*  Yeah, but it's thicker like the tubes thicker and it's like spirally. It's long. Yeah. Yeah, it's long like a spaghetti Wow
*  But I wish I knew the really like a rotini. Yeah. Yeah, but twirly all the way down like spaghetti. That's twirly. It's so good
*  I got it like that long like a real piece of spaghetti
*  Yeah, dude, it's actually probably a little longer I get it from Italy
*  So I bought like a couple of cases of it off Amazon
*  I'm so addicted to it. Yeah, I want to know what that is. I love the world needs long
*  I'll send you a photo of it afterwards long rotini. It comes in like this yellow package
*  That's exactly what it looks like fusilli longi
*  Long pot so it's long fusilli. It's so good, dude. So what I like to do
*  If I eat domestic animals, particularly this how I like to a lot of times when I have if I have ribeye with spaghetti
*  I'll cook the ribeye and get it like, you know, like just about medium rare
*  And then I slice that bitch up and drop it into tomato sauce
*  Just a couple more minutes. Oh, just get it all in there
*  Get all that juicy in there and then and then dump these big thick slices of ribeye with tomato sauce on that Italian pasta
*  Yeah, I can get fat. Yes, it's so fast and it's beautiful
*  Sometimes you can put the pasta, you know, you make your pasta some pastas are better put in the sauce directly
*  Yeah, and some are better obviously keeping them separated and some absorb the sauce
*  And some of them you cook longer in the sauce and some of them you don't see this resonates with everybody delicious
*  Pasta resonates with everybody. That's why so many women were mad when Adele lost all that weight
*  Yes, like no bitch. I don't want to give up on this fucking pasta
*  I was with you when you were big. Yeah, see this a new photo of her. Yeah. No, I saw it this morning
*  First thing I knew the literally the first thing that I thought of the second my eyes laid on that picture
*  I'm like this is gonna be crazy because people are going to say in these comments that she's beautiful and
*  That's going to be hilarious because you're basically saying that she wasn't beautiful before by saying that she's beautiful now in a weird way
*  They're sort of insinuated and and I I didn't even realize until
*  Two hours or an hour later after I had woken up that it became like this like news story
*  so it's just funny to me because
*  like it's like
*  Is there voice the same right because that's what matters. Well, it's it's funny in that why wouldn't you?
*  Want to
*  Applaud someone who did something that's really difficult to do and is now healthier
*  Yeah, if you are an Adele fan
*  Wouldn't you want her to be healthier?
*  Wouldn't you I mean you wanted to be able to keep singing for longer, right? You love her
*  You wanted to be healthier. You don't want her to get one of the main
*  Things they found in in New York City about people that
*  Caught COVID-19 that was a real problem was obesity
*  big problem
*  She was at one point in time much larger and now she's like really slim and people are mad and
*  Saying this is what they're saying
*  I don't want her to be applauded for losing weight as if it's some some to some
*  wording like this like that I don't want to
*  Adhere to these beauty standards that she's better looking because she lost weight
*  But she is yeah
*  And you know that the only reason why anybody would want to fight against that when so many people
*  Overwhelmingly think she looks better is because they don't want to look at themselves. It's that simple
*  They don't want to change and they want you to just they're trying to bully you in deciding
*  They're beautiful if they're 210 pounds. Yeah, that's that's really what it is
*  It's like, you know, we're redefining beauty standards. You can't do that
*  You can't decide that the way you look is what everybody should like that's crazy
*  You can't do that and if people have
*  decided worldwide that
*  fitter healthier bodies are more attractive
*  That's just what it is. Yeah, that's what you can't it's not redefining beauty standards
*  The beauty standards come from what people are attracted to. Yeah, it's not fair. You're right. It's not fair
*  A lot of shit in life's not fair. Yeah, that's just how it is
*  Yeah, if you choose to stay big that is your choice
*  I know it's a difficult choice to try to move your your body down and lose weight and get healthy
*  We really talked about that. We're just talking about it
*  But you can't say that it's unattractive when someone has a good body because it is
*  So if someone has a better body than they used to have it looks better
*  So that's what a beauty standard is. This is what what people are attracted to when it comes to bodies
*  They're attracted to fit bodies. That's not a that's not a shame
*  That's not a bad thing like the idea that this is somehow another that's something we need to avoid and putting undue pressure on people
*  It's nonsense. It looks great if it's pressure on you because other people look great. Well, what do you do with that pressure?
*  Do you decide to be better better yourself? Take care yourself better?
*  Do you decide do you decide that it's not worth as much to you to?
*  Worry about what your body looks like and you're more concentrated on maybe art or whatever the fuck else. That's fine, too
*  But you can't be mad at people that put a lot of energy in that direction and look better
*  Right because she looks better. It's not a bad thing
*  And isn't saying that everybody's body is beautiful. No matter what doesn't that make it like worse for the
*  People with ugly faces
*  You know what I mean?
*  Because like then they're more part of just a smaller group like if there's some lady that has like
*  Her eyes are on like the side of her head butch is an a banging body, right?
*  She still gets action
*  Yeah, I guess no problem at all. Yeah, of course. She's hot. Well, dude men don't care that much
*  It's beauty standards are just what people what are people attracted to it's and people are generally attracted to people that are healthier
*  That's just a physical thing. That's a part of and we're only talking about
*  Attractive like sexual attraction, right? We're not saying
*  you know if you're 20 or 30 pounds overweight like
*  You look horrible and I want to look at you like I have a lot of friends that are fat
*  But it is what it is. It's just it is what it is
*  And maybe they'll find somebody that's into that but you can't like decide that people are gonna change what they're attracted to
*  That's silly. You can't do that. Like they are attracted to people that put out more effort
*  They're attracted to people that have the strength to get up at six o'clock in the morning go to the gym before work
*  There's something really hot about that. It's attractive. Yeah, it's attractive someone who takes care of themselves
*  It is it just is now it might not be to you
*  But that's why the world's beautiful because we can all have different things that we like and different things we don't like but when a
*  Giant chunk of people are into this one thing like nice bodies
*  It doesn't mean that the it's all shallow or terrible or it's somehow another
*  Demeaning to people that don't adhere to those standards. No, it's a competition. There's a some sort of a physical
*  physical
*  physiological competition between males and females in terms of like trying to be attractive and that's one of things they do they make their
*  Body look better. Another thing they do is dress nice. They wear jewelry
*  They do stuff to make themselves look better the idea that making your body look better is
*  Somehow or another this is a bad standard to adhere to when you take your big body that you're not taking care of and you
*  Wrap it up and all this crazy clothes and all these ribbons and bows and you show your
*  Bare midriff cuz you're brave and you got your big old ass these jeans like yeah, it still looks pretty good
*  Don't get me wrong still look great
*  Honestly, I thought Adele I thought Adele looked a little I
*  Thought she looked cuter a little bit thicker now. She looks sort of looks I mean granted she looks healthier
*  But she looks a little bit
*  More just basic you know what I mean sort of just like every all the other pop stars well in every movie
*  Where there's a guy who's kind of a fuck-up who's gonna get in trouble
*  It's a guy who's built like you with a woman who's like 250 pounds and she tells him what to do
*  So maybe it's like a thing like that's like
*  When it doesn't hasn't David Spade played a character like that where there's like he's got a big wife or a big girl, right?
*  There's always a few of those think so
*  Maybe that's your thing
*  Maybe you like to dole and show how
*  Shallow how yeah, that's right
*  Yeah, dude, maybe that's your thing is what big ones you like them big so when Adele was big you like yes
*  Control me
*  Hold me down
*  Maybe I don't know I
*  Want to know what her voice sounds like what if she sounds horrible now cuz like she had that operatic
*  Right yeah powerful powerful voice I
*  Was having a conversation with a buddy who told me like to have a ball gag put in his mouth. It's like really
*  Who's he talking about during sex?
*  This is a podcast during sex
*  Like what people are into I'm saying you know I'm not saying that people can't be into big girls
*  There's a lot of people into big girls, but a lot of people are into everything you know, but that's okay, too
*  Like a lot of people are into weird stuff you got to try out different things
*  I think if you can't if you can get it. It's fun
*  Dude people's brains are not the same right the idea that what you like
*  I'm supposed to like or what I like you're supposed to like you spend so much time watching pro wrestling
*  Yeah, I watch it every now and then oh my god. It's crazy move. Yeah, I can't yeah, but you can we're different
*  You can too you just have you just haven't yet. I'll never give up on that
*  Have to do a fight companion with a wrestling event sometime well as a comic you're probably the greatest wrestling
*  In terms of like who's a real evangelist you're wrestling evangelist. You're always trying to get people to watch pro wrestling
*  I don't think it's for everybody, but I think I think I think you would love it. I
*  Don't think so without the the WrestleMania event what the run or takers match. Yeah, that's a sell to him
*  I like girls the girls wrestling seems more realistic
*  WrestleMania was great. What about what the undertaker?
*  You didn't like it
*  It was very cinematic. They've been doing things more like a movie as of late because they don't have an audience
*  Yeah, I enjoyed Rhonda Rousey. I enjoyed she made a great transition to WWE. She really did she really did
*  Yeah, she's great at it. Well. She's a pro. You know like that's why she was a medalist in judo in the Olympics
*  That's why she was a beast in MMA. She's a pro and she took to that like a pro like she really played the heel
*  Well, she played mean well. Yeah, it was great. You know and
*  Physically she could do so much with her judo
*  There's so much shit that you and the way how strong she is wish you could throw women around. It's pretty crazy and
*  Because of that that's that's what really works is when it looks like an like she messed something up sort of is the best stuff
*  Mmm, that's what you sort of want to feel real to you right? Why don't just watch real shit fuck
*  I do I watch I watch real stuff, too
*  There's a huge crossover of people that enormous our MMA and pro wrestling fans like really respected journalists in MMA
*  Oh, yeah, big time. Oh, they were all they were all going crazy over WrestleMania
*  I couldn't believe it Ariel. Ha Wani and
*  Brett Okamoto all of them are talking about I could not believe it because I follow
*  I don't follow many people on Twitter, but I follow those guys and I like these
*  MMA and sure enough the one like wrestling journalists that I followed on it
*  Was like this is crap. This is the worst WrestleMania ever like I'm like, oh my god nuts
*  That's happen. But isn't that always the case?
*  Someone's gonna say it's fucking terrible and someone's gonna say it was the best thing I've ever seen right with fucking everything. Yeah
*  Everything god damn it. Yep
*  And that's like why the Irishman shocked me granted it's not the you know
*  It's not like parasite where it's like wow what a crazy work of art
*  But it was a great Scorsese movie to me and like the bad
*  What there's a bad critic for everything now and whoever got that out there that the Irishman bad made it better for me
*  Because it lowered my expectations dude. I saw people commenting about Ozark. Yeah negatively commenting about Ozark
*  Like okay, this is just proof of my thing that shows masterpiece
*  It's a masterpiece if you're into a dramatic thriller where you don't know where the fuck they're going that show is a goddamn masterpiece
*  Yeah, every show leaves you hanging on the edge. You can't wait to find out what the fuck happened
*  Yeah, it's a masterpiece and I was reading all these dismissive comments. I was like, oh my god
*  Thank you. It just like puts it all in perspective. Like who are we listening to who's writing that? Yeah
*  She's in Bateman's a monster
*  The fact that he's directing that is insane
*  like that's a great transition to dirt to directing one time though his daughter had a cell phone and she was she had an Android phone and
*  she was making a text to him and
*  Like he was making a text to her and they would see the dot dot dots dot dot dots
*  You don't get those on an Android phone. Oh
*  Very interesting. Yeah, you get those if you've got an iPhone bitch. Yeah, that makes sense
*  Right. That's why Ian Edwards keeps an Android
*  It's like son. I don't want anybody to know what I'm texting from a fucking computer
*  He goes you tell me you could be texting some shit and someone's reading it on a computer why is it even on there?
*  You ever get a text message in your laptop you just feel violated like what is this why are you texting me here?
*  Why is it showing up here?
*  Now I'm trying to get away from my phone I'm working over here. Yeah, I do doink. Yeah
*  That's annoying, right? I just got a new laptop and I can't figure out how to shut that off. Oh, you got it
*  Yeah, you got to go in your settings. I
*  Couldn't find yeah, you can shut it off. But sometimes it turns itself on again
*  It's super annoying. It's weird too because
*  Apple figured out that the blue bubble looks better. It's really simple
*  And so if a text message comes in it doesn't just say text message instead of I message
*  No, no, no, you also get a different color bitch. Imagine if it was black, but here's the thing
*  Is it's like all black with white letters is pretty dope. Yeah, that'd be the best but here's the thing
*  Well, you can you could do that too. All right. Oh, you know you get a nighttime mode
*  I gotta do that. You don't know about that
*  That I know I've mentioned this before but the thing that really bothers me about it is that the the color for the app is green
*  Mmm, they fucked it by putting the the mail app blue and you can't just have another blue app
*  But yeah, but when you do get a green bubble with a black screen is not as bad
*  The color combination of green on black is not as bad as
*  Green on white green on white is kind of offensive
*  It just looks wrong it doesn't belong with it. It's like they tricked us
*  It's very wise because all text used to be green and then they realized blue looks better
*  Shh quickly quickly take the blue. They just took blue. They just took it. But here's the thing if you have an
*  Android phone and you send it through their messages app
*  You know the they're a little client that they use to send text messages
*  You can have it all kinds of colors. You could actually
*  You could change it you can make it red you can make it black you could you could do a bunch of shit
*  It's all customizable. That's why they like it
*  But Apple keeps you locked into their little system. I've updated my Windows PC
*  Recently and they're trying to do something like that. I'm not letting my phone and computer buy into it
*  But it's like hey, by the way, you know
*  You can connect your phone when you sign in now and have all of this shit here
*  I'm like whenever I think about I see those messages
*  I read them back to myself in the same voice as the demon trying to convince Bruce Jenner to be a woman
*  I remember that bit that I used to do. I read that's how I read them like
*  You would know a little bit about this there's something I not discovered last night
*  But there's a new popular game that's out and the anti cheat
*  Like program that runs in the background of your computer is
*  Goes all the way down to the kernels of your computer, which is something don't be a pussy but nothing wrong
*  They're now saying that this is a
*  The company that owns this runs it is based in China and that's a potential spyware
*  racist
*  Chinese stuff in your kernels
*  Lock into the matrix
*  How long before the first person gets in the matrix do we have five years even I don't think so
*  I don't think we have five years for we have bolts in the back of our head that we tie into a clamp
*  Big old hose thing right here. I was looking around
*  There's a this is a potential Jesus Christ Western University a co vid tracking
*  Thing that they're detested with like less than 30 people
*  But oh my god
*  That's so crazy to track stroke patients and like changes in your breathing and lungs or something and like sounds in there that connect to
*  a device which is your phone and let you know if
*  What is what better way to get integrated with the grid then to create a virus that makes you wear a mask
*  Takes away your humanity can't touch each other
*  Gotta stay away. No social contact. So you're getting more and more addicted to your TV and your phone more and more addicted to your laptop
*  I'll free you
*  But you got to take a test and then I got to put a tracking thing on you
*  Cuz I want to make sure that you're a good boy Tony
*  You're a good boy. You don't go catch no co vid and spreading it around
*  So I gotta know where you are so I could chart out the health of the public
*  Frightening whoo
*  Can't give that up folks five stage reopening process based on risk
*  Stage one safer at home order planning for recovery stage two which we're about to go into that's now right
*  This Friday florist some retailers car dealerships golf courses and trails soon other low-risk businesses
*  manufacturers office retail essential health care outdoor recreation and
*  Libraries, I thought we already can outdoor right so we're talking about earlier, but you have to wear they say here
*  It's on this screen. You have to wear face cover covering when you go out there in the trails
*  You must adhere to so so are they making runners wear face masks while they're running? No
*  Not on the streets, I don't think but it may if you're in a trail you could probably get stopped
*  Find out if that's true because I've been reading all these things that say that there's you know
*  We joked around about it before like if someone passes you when they're running like how close are they to you?
*  But it doesn't seem like there's any sort of science to say that it spreads that way like I know that's what I've read
*  That and didn't think that that was true, too
*  But I texted Brendan shop. He said he got a ticket for being on that trail
*  I don't know what the ticket was for but
*  I was like did you really get a ticket?
*  He said yeah, did he get a ticket for just being there or did he get a ticket for not wearing a mask?
*  I'm not sure Wow so
*  Museums cultural centers and galleries. Thank God they can open up LACMA and you can stare at a plexiglass box at some
*  fucking dipshit
*  Glued together look at that stage three separated with velvet ropes stage three high-risk businesses body art massage bars
*  nightclubs
*  Movie theaters and bowling alleys, so we have to wait we have to wait for the next stage
*  Are we and then stage four higher risk businesses entertainment venues? Oh wait a minute that might be us
*  Wait a minute. Yeah, like what is an entertainment venue is that like?
*  They're like a large arena
*  There might be more like a thousand people more like a concert venue don't say a thousand Jamie give him a bad idea
*  Say 3000 3000 we want theaters
*  Yes, you do comedy and theaters if they shut down all the arenas
*  And I just have to do ten shows instead of one we can do that. This is just Los Angeles
*  I know but these fucks it doesn't matter though. This is what?
*  The count also Ohio's just passed a law they said to change what the the Department of Health is doing so that they're like
*  Superceding the rules like in their Congress like only have 14. I don't know so listen I think
*  ultimately a word
*  Hating this with California's doing like ultimately there's way less people that got it here than got it anywhere else
*  So it's probably a good idea
*  but as a comedian it fucking sucks it as a person who is
*  Is
*  Not in the highest of risks. It's it sucks
*  I know quite a few people that have had it and we're gonna actually have Michael Yo come on next week
*  I'm really interested to talk to him because he had it real bad
*  And he got it from New York and then there's been some speculation that the people who got it from New York
*  They get it from Europe, but the people that got it in California a lot of them got it from China
*  Which is really interesting. It's like I wonder if as it went through Europe it got worse
*  Like that's that's possible right and wasn't that something that they speculated that there's some sort of different strains
*  Yeah, but what couldn't New York people just come to LA for sure from China
*  Yeah, they could but I think the when they track the origin. I think that's the reason they can test. Yeah. Yeah
*  I think there's
*  Imagine a more unlike me trying to even say this but I think there's some sort of a genetic tracing
*  To what they're doing back to November flu samples to see if they can check it to back then
*  So they found December though, right? Is that confirmed or is that just specular?
*  Yeah, is that the one in Sweden
*  Cuz I read something that Sweden has it back to November or December now has what back they've traced
*  Covid back to Sweden as far as November. So you're saying in terms of their their
*  Opening back up. They're kind of opened up. Yeah and Sweden
*  Yeah, but but here's the thing you also got to realize that Sweden is not the United States. Like it's it's a weird place
*  It's really stretched out and there's not a lot of people there
*  it's not it's nothing like New York like the thing about New York is like
*  That's like a house made out of hay and someone drops a cigar and that motherfucker just catches on fire
*  Wow
*  There's so many people the viral load you must take in every day if you live in Manhattan
*  On the subway fucking right next to people breathing in everybody's air. Everybody's coughing
*  It's getting in there's only so much air in that room
*  even if you talk about forget about the subway and just talk about the
*  Entrance door to either their home or their workplace has hundreds of people minimum going through it every single day
*  And those hundreds of people that go through that door every single day
*  They're on the subway or they're walking by people on the street. It's just too much way too much
*  So many people they're all breathing each other's funk. Yeah
*  Sweden says coronavirus was likely in the country as early as November 2000. That's what I read
*  So they found in France from that time too
*  Wow, I appreciate their approach that they're going through and let it be known Sweden's a smart
*  Frickin place man when I was there with you Stockholm
*  Wow, so he had one one had a patient in France who was infected with kovat 19 back in December a month before the contingent
*  With was thought to have reached Europe
*  Doctors retroactively tested the samples from when the man was admitted to the hospital near Paris on December 27th with a cough headache and a fever
*  Oh
*  This it really does feel like more than one disease and apparently there's a strain in India
*  And there's some concern that even when they come up with a vaccine this strain in India is
*  Going to be immune to it. It's not gonna work on this strain because it strains so different than what's going on right now
*  Do you see kovat toes yet?
*  Kovat toes is a new like you get funky toenails serious symptom. No, it's the actual toe toe
*  Like it's like it turns bright red because of blood clotting and it is a it is a serious symptom of
*  The coronavirus something that in fact I saw one person get diagnosed just from that. They had no other symptoms
*  So they diagnosed the person because of kovat toes read a whole long thing about it Wow
*  It's a fucking weird disease man
*  Some people seem to get it and just walk it off and other people get it and it's a death sentence
*  It doesn't make it doesn't seem like anything else
*  Maybe it's just like we just haven't been paying attention to you know when I found out there was
*  61,000 people that died from the flu a year ago. Yeah, 61,000
*  Right, that's so many fucking people. Yeah
*  That's crazy. Like you would have never believed that and I know there's been more deaths from kovat
*  but the other thing we were trying to figure out somebody tweeted that
*  there was
*  because of
*  the fact that there's so many kovat deaths that there's actually a decrease in the amount of people that have died from heart disease and
*  They're thinking how many people are not being counted
*  How many people that died of heart disease like how accurate is the count because I think the weight what they're doing is if you have kovat
*  You die you died from kovat
*  They don't investigate to see if there were some other things that might have killed you and kovat just also was there
*  Like maybe this is the cause oh he had a clearly had a heart attack
*  Oh, this is the cause he clearly had of this now. They're saying that kovat might even cause heart attacks in people
*  You know that might cause strokes and and weird blood clots in people so it's like it's different in different people
*  It's like a it's so strange and it almost feels like like we're living like people lived in the past
*  We get your your information piecemeal like what what's happening because it's new and they don't really know
*  It's not like this is like this an established science about measles right they know what the fuck it is
*  They know how to prevent. They don't how to make a vaccine
*  They know there's not with this with this it's like what what's going like we haven't put all the pieces together yet
*  So we're experiencing it in real time along with the world's foremost medical experts
*  Do you see the scientist from Pittsburgh that supposedly was close to a breakthrough that got murdered in a murder-suicide?
*  Yes, yes, yeah, I did see that that's crazy. It is crazy. Yeah, like what the hell yeah
*  You I'm in the middle of this Jack Carter novel. It's all about crazy espionage and murder and murder for hire and shit and
*  You know of course instantly when I see something like this
*  I go oh my god
*  What if they whacked him and they whacked this guy to cover up their tracks?
*  They didn't want him to find a cure because they're working on their own cure. Yeah, like very significant findings
*  Like that according to the University that guy does not look like the guy that would get murdered for anything
*  Gunshot wounds the head and you don't read Jack Carter with John Carr books
*  You rack read I can't even talk if you read Jack Carr books
*  You would totally think he looks like a guy that gets shot because everybody gets shot
*  hmm
*  That guy's books are so violent man. Everybody's getting shot
*  So it says they found him in his townhouse, and then the other person
*  The suspect they found shot themselves in a car right is that what it is mm-hmm
*  Yep, returning to his car and taking his own life Wow see that's the story
*  Is that what happened so it could have been like a bad business deal or?
*  Maybe a love triangle or
*  something
*  Imagine if you were on your way to developing a vaccine for something and that vaccine was gonna net your company an
*  Estimated 1.9 billion dollars and then this fucking smarty pants dipshit. Let's let me say that guy some guy in Vancouver
*  figures out a
*  way to kill this stuff
*  And he wants to publish it
*  And you gotta get to him
*  Gotta get to him before he publishes it because if if he does if this super smart guy has figured something out about the structure of
*  this virus
*  And he knows how to fix it. He knows how to fix this problem. The world's facing. We're gonna. It's an easy fix
*  That's possible that's in books. I've read it in books I
*  Guarantee actually I've listened to it in audiobooks, but the same thing
*  I've become obsessed with this
*  criminal psychology thing on YouTube called Jim can't swim and he breaks down
*  Interrogation videos. Oh, I've heard of this guy so addictive
*  I actually got on patreon and he's the first person I've ever been a patreon person Wow and I went and I
*  Blasted through this stuff. It is so cool
*  And it's all criminal psychology and he talks about how these interrogators and they have he has great video somehow of these
*  Interrogations and how these people break through and help stop it and show you
*  Like here's what he's doing and here's why and how they get people and how why people lie and how they lie and this and that
*  It's so damn interesting
*  Because you watch people they cannot cover their tracks
*  And then once you watch enough of them once you're like halfway through you already know like you're like, oh, they're they're guilty
*  Oh, they just gave it away before he even stops it. You know how
*  It's crazy that that whole criminal world like they can't lie. There's you would think that
*  You know, you would think like oh I could fool one of those guys like I could fool a
*  Detective if he was interrogating me and it's like no you know not you know what?
*  It's probably like like I'm gonna heckle this guy. I'm gonna fuck up his act
*  Exactly, and then the comedian tortures you I saw one where this lady
*  Killed her husband's wife or killed
*  Her ex-boyfriend's wife right it back in college at UCLA
*  Yep, killed her got away with it became an LAPD detective, right get this
*  25 years later
*  Then
*  They realized that this detective on their force
*  Could potentially be the murderer and
*  How do they figure out that she could be the murderer?
*  Well, they ended up interviewing some people from back then they had this cold case. What's really ironic is that they're
*  They did so good all these detectives that they ran out of basically stuff to do so they got to start going way back
*  on cold cases and looking more into them and
*  So they looked at some interviews and this and that and they're like this lady works on the force and then they ended up
*  finding out more and more and more that she could have been attached so they kept it a secret and
*  They kept a completely secret from her and they just brought her down to a break room saying that they had some questions about something
*  Little did she know that the interrogation had begun?
*  She was the worst liar
*  She literally had 25 years of guilt like built up. It's like a steaming teapot
*  So she's literally like what is this? What is this about? What are you kidding me? Watch this online? Oh, yeah
*  Where what is it? It's called Jim can't Jim can't swim but that particular one. I want to know that one begins with an L. It's a
*  Lazarus files. Yep, Stephanie Lazarus Jamie, please send me that link Stephanie
*  One of those things where I wish we could play something. Yeah on the show and listen to that
*  It's so check that out. So good
*  Goddamn and they stop and they show you like little things like right from the beginning
*  You know, they they say the guy's name wrong
*  Like do you know John Hoover or whatever it was and the guy's name was John Hoover and she goes John Hoover John John Hoover
*  And she takes way too long and then she goes you mean maybe John Hoover and then they stop it and he's like
*  You know, she thought of John Hoover immediately
*  She's pretending like she's searching through her brain like they show you what they're showing
*  She's pretending like this is no big deal. They have to put it out there nervous
*  It's basically fucking guy everything that the person does is showing you what they're hiding
*  Ah
*  Do this guy went to clean out his mom's apartment she died and he found a
*  Feet a freezer one of those chest freezers with a dead decomposing body in it
*  So the body had been there the freezer was it was I think was in the basement see if you can find this
*  I'm I believe this was in
*  New Jersey, I think it was in New Jersey. So when he or no it was in Manhattan
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure was in Manhattan
*  It was a one of those giant ass meat freezers and someone threw the body in there and duct taped it all shut
*  So the stink couldn't get out and she wouldn't let anybody visit her building man goes to clear out dead mom's house
*  Finds body in freezer
*  Please say a man found a decomposed body and his dead mother's freezer as she was cleared out of her New York City apartment
*  Wow, he found the body this week in a chest freezer that had been sealed with duct tape
*  Investigators said the body appeared to have been stored for over 10 years
*  Building superintendent asked me or basim told the newspaper on Friday's article. The body was so decayed that
*  authorities couldn't determine it sex
*  Basim said they wouldn't let she wouldn't let them there it is
*  The deceased tenant never gave permission to for work to be done in the Hamilton Heights apartment. That was that's what I thought was funny
*  She's like no, I'm good
*  They're like, um, your plumbing's bad no plumbing's perfect
*  Is there a smell coming out of your place? Not anymore? No, not anymore. No smell. Thanks click bolt shut clip two locks
*  Should have fucking chest freezer with a dead body
*  What's worse cleaning your dead mom's place and finding a dead body or having her dildo hit you in the face off a shelf?
*  The body I don't care if my mom uses a dildo
*  That's her choice if her dildo is a free woman fell off the top shelf and hit you in the head
*  I get over a pussy
*  Doink. Yeah better than a body your mother's a murderer killed somebody ten fucking years ago and threw him in an ice chest and duct
*  Taped it shut what the fuck?
*  Realize you supported your mother's use of dildos
*  I love your mother. I hope she's happy
*  She is your mother kills yeah, she's the best if you write for your mother your mother be a world-class traveling stand-up
*  Which when she did that kill Tony and she went up and did stand up with with notes and had never done it before
*  Murdered she murdered murdered your mother like legitimately had great timing great delivery
*  She leaned into the punchline. She was killing man. Yeah, she was killing. It was funny. That was fun
*  She would listen to my few notes, you know
*  And she just did it she had fun. I told her to smile enjoy it. Don't forget to smile and
*  Leave spaces in between the jokes. Those are the two things. It was so cool to see too
*  Yeah, it's like when someone does something like that
*  They've never done before and their son is a professional stand-up and it was honest your son's podcast
*  In the in a live audience, which is like every the biggest fear people have is fucking up in front of a large crowd. Yeah
*  When the Cummings told me that that comes from when in the past when people were in front of large crowds
*  Usually it's because you're being judged like you did something wrong and the group is turning on you. I was like, oh that makes sense
*  That's where that fear comes from. Yeah, that makes total sense total makes sense. Yeah
*  Like that when we were evolving, you know as we're going through the civilizations of the past
*  If it was a group of people that was staring at you and you're you're around all these people and you're down and they're all up
*  Around all these people you're down and they're all up like that's fucking terrifying for sure
*  Or perhaps even about to be executed right for sure. Yeah for sure when there's one person and everyone's focusing on them
*  Most of the time that's scary because most of the time it's bad occasionally someone's performing, you know, but most of the time it's really bad
*  Yeah, it's like a group of people are trying to kill you
*  The only time it's really good is when everything's going great
*  There's plenty of food and booze then the person like we're gonna listen to you because you're exceptional because you have a
*  Wonderful voice or you you're really good with the musical instrument
*  Yeah, that is weird. It's fucking real weird the fear that people get
*  In you know going out there and and performing and having people boo at them and hate them
*  They're so scared of it
*  It's interesting that's where booze comes in right
*  If people like how many people have given speeches at their companies like you know
*  They get together and have a company Christmas party and has someone unfortunately is a microphone a bunch of people are boozing
*  And so he goes up there it just ruins their fucking life
*  How many times does that happen
*  How many times does that happen when someone thought they could say something that Chris Rock would say?
*  Let me try out a bit they try out a bit at their company party for from then on
*  You get brought into human resources on monday, yeah tony I want you to tell me about saturday night
*  Tell me from your perspective
*  Why did you say what you said? Why did you do what you did? It's so funny
*  No, yeah, they're supplying you with booze, which is hilarious
*  Like if they had just coke and and joints rolled up laying around
*  People
*  People would never blame you
*  They wouldn't blame you if you gave them coke and and and got them high as fuck
*  Bong hits and they were saying wacky shit curled up in the corner. You wouldn't blame them
*  But you got an open bar
*  Are you fucking christmas party and Mikey gets a little sauced up and says something stupid and you're mad at him
*  it's so funny to think about like how
*  Real companies have christmas parties with alcohol and all that and then you have you ever been to a comedy store christmas party?
*  I don't like christmas party, right? That's why i'm asking. I know everybody else is there
*  But I don't think i've ever seen you at one and it's probably a good thing because it's complete chaos
*  It's beyond like thick because obviously the comedy store has no has less than no hr. So it's
*  It's
*  Way way way way over the top like it's absolutely ridiculous
*  Continuous continuous alcohol
*  Consumption like shots and shots and shots and shots and shots and shots and shots when is it coming back?
*  When do you think we'll move into that lovely phase three?
*  I don't know man. I think I think maybe my guess right now would be eight to twelve weeks something starts
*  Eight to twelve perhaps perhaps the main room spaced out with the or I wonder if they can hang in there that long
*  That's a long time to hang in there. I think so you think so I I do I think uh
*  I think that they've done really well as a blade
*  Like really well
*  There's something about alcohol sales, which takes a business to a whole nother level and they've been slinging some drinks
*  they certainly have but
*  Look it's it's hard for everybody and it's paid for right they own the building
*  It's a missy's building and if they were paying rent it would be rough
*  But my god those shows back when we come back my god
*  That was gonna be fun. That was gonna be fun because you never thought it could be taken away from you. Yeah, you're away from everybody
*  Honestly, I was mad at you the first day because you were the I had a show with you that night
*  We performed the night before and the next morning I wake up and I see your tweet saying unfortunately
*  I'm gonna cancel my shows tonight at the comedy store, right? Yeah, and i'm literally like come on joe
*  You're falling for this fake disease like I was I was more like this is bullshit
*  And well, it was it was actually an order like we oh no, I know in retrospect obviously like I was wrong
*  Yeah, they wanted 200 people or less. They had gotten to this 200 people or less place
*  Which I thought was really weird like
*  It's okay if 200 people get sick. Like what is that 400 is bad 200 is good. Like it's the same environment
*  It's just a larger number. So they had an arbitrary 200 number so
*  And then I cancelled the other shows too. I was like, i'm just gonna cancel
*  I'm like I think we should cancel because there was some improv shows that we still had booked
*  I'm like we better cancel. This just just seems to it seemed like a storm was coming
*  It was it was changing like by the hour
*  I was in negotiating with constant negotiations with the comedy store when that started on that thursday or friday
*  I was still fighting for my monday
*  Like i'm like, that's great. Then we can they're allowing 200 then we can do 200 two hours later
*  They're like it's got to be 100 and i'm like, okay 100 and then they're like, well
*  The comedy store is closing indefinitely and i'm like great
*  well, how about you just let us shoot in the main room with no audience and
*  Some staff and they're like, well, no
*  Uh, we they're like at first they're like yes, and then they're like no and then I had to renegotiate because they're like
*  No, we're closing the main room to quarantine it. I'm like great
*  We'll stream out of the original room with no staff and no comedians
*  And they're like that's good for literally for like four hours. And then I got a call. Look we we're closing the entire building
*  We can't can't and i'm and they're like if you want to do the basement
*  You can stream out of the basement. I'm like we can't definitely can't do the basement. It's too stuff in the basement
*  Well the fuck of it we ended up great story, you know, we did how did we get into the basement?
*  Let me tell you how we got into the base
*  We're basically in the basement now over at better box studios, but we ended up doing one out in the empty ice house
*  How cool is that that ended up being really cool? We did like a q a session in the empty
*  ice house
*  Very interesting was pouring down rain monday night. That's the part that made it like extra creepy
*  I hope the ice house is okay, too
*  Improv all these clubs
*  We got to do something to really get them juiced up once. Uh, everything gets rolling again for sure
*  we're gonna have a lot of uh
*  a lot of creative juices
*  I wonder what the stipulation is going to be as far as uh, what has to take place like what would they it was would it be?
*  An effective treatment what would have to be where they would let us do comedy again
*  I wonder what would it be because they have some effective treatments that they're investigating. I wonder if that would be enough
*  They let them the they knew there was a good supply of it. They get it to the hospitals
*  Uh, they don't even know if you can catch it twice
*  Right, they're thinking you might be able to catch it again. It might wear off and then you can catch it again
*  Which is like what?
*  I sort of am not buying into that
*  I think that's another one that the news wants us to think that you can catch it again
*  Well, we got it
*  You might be able to catch it again
*  but it's like a lot of the most recent things that i've read from like health organizations are saying good news finally some good news and
*  You have to like look deep to find good news now you have to dig
*  like with a shovel to find good news and
*  Literally like most of and of course a doctor doctor serious doctor will tell you well
*  We really don't know don't know because that's what
*  Professional scientists say right until they officially know but right now most professionals are saying
*  You can't get it twice
*  I think in china they've found a small percentage of people they got it twice. I'm not
*  I'm not I don't trust anything coming out of china right now. I don't trust their numbers
*  Their scientists their news or their hornet surely your pro fortune cookie
*  Absolutely 100 percent. Okay. Okay those lucky numbers
*  I take it to the bank imagine if china brought over the murder hornets on purpose just to fuck up our b supply
*  Just to fuck up our economy even further
*  Could you imagine if we found out these motherfuckers brought over those murder hornets imagine if that's the next thing
*  Like they're doing some old school gingus khan shit. They brought the plague. They're bringing over murder hornets. Yeah, imagine
*  We found a good kind of war that china is involved with the united states
*  Trying to weaken us from within wouldn't it be wild if like they're like, you know, pay us the money you owe us
*  And we just kept ignoring them and they're like, all right
*  The relationship we have with china right now is more hostile than anything I can ever remember
*  More hostile than we've ever felt with russia. It seems
*  more hostile than
*  it's like as hostile as
*  Iran when we killed that soli mani dude
*  It's almost like as a hostile with that all the time and it's a special kind right because we can't even acknowledge
*  How mad we are at them yet until we have our own thing sort of figured out. Yeah, we don't know shit
*  Yeah, we don't know where it came from. It's almost like when um
*  When you're mad at someone but you don't want to make a big deal of it at like the dinner table or something like
*  You want to talk to them one-on-one afterwards?
*  Right, like it's like we can't even acknowledge how mad we are at china for this until
*  We have a vaccine right and then we're gonna be like hey, by the way, what the fuck dude
*  You gave everybody the coronavirus you could have had it taken care of you did that
*  They said if they had acted sooner, we could have stopped
*  95% of its spread. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, that is nuts
*  Yeah, imagine if it didn't start in the lab and everybody accuses this start a lap and the people in the lab are like
*  You fucks we didn't even do this. This is just some normal shit
*  Just some normal shit that it could have come from this lab, but it didn't came from this fucking market
*  Yeah, but imagine the labs just right there. It's right near the market. So close. Yeah, what are the odds that a market that has had?
*  Humans and bats in it for a very long time all of a sudden
*  I'm getting lab vibes from this one. Well, how about this instead of lab vibes? Maybe think about it this way
*  Maybe since they're doing these fucking experiments on bats, right?
*  They're doing coronavirus experience on bats experiments on bats that are coming from the exact same caves
*  As where this disease has originated
*  What if someone is selling the bats?
*  After they do experiments with them. Yeah, what if someone just says as long as they cook it, it'd be fine
*  Someone didn't cook it. They're good. Yeah, and then they caught corona from it or maybe it's just hanging there
*  You know, maybe they sold that bat and they just hung there with all the other bats and that stuff just got in the air
*  And somebody got it next to them
*  Working in a tight spaced market all the people breathing and this funky ass experimental bat is hanging from a meat hook
*  And they're probably like as long as they make bat soup they're gonna have to boil it it'll be fine
*  This is 25 with a bat and the one person that bought it liked bat sushi the rest is history
*  I don't think they make bat sushi bats are predators, right? You have to cook those fuckers
*  You know like what?
*  What is a bat worth like how much does it cost to buy a bat to eat?
*  If you had a guess like us dollars, how much is a bat in a wet market?
*  In us dollars us dollars if you over there you got a hundred dollars in your pocket tony
*  How much do you have left after you buy a bat for dinner?
*  Geez I would say not much because so much food seems like it would be better than a bat it seems like a ratty animal
*  Right. Yeah, but if you bought a bat in a restaurant
*  Like how much do you think it costs? Well a restaurant store market. I'm sorry a market i'm gonna say three bucks three dollars for a bat
*  So, let's see if we could find this out
*  What is what do you think you think it's more or less less american less I think it's a dollar
*  Yeah, probably because a dollar american for a bat
*  They don't look like they're greedy. That's the other thing people like oh my god. These fucking people are so greedy
*  They make trying to make money selling rats like no, they're really really poor
*  Like they're eating rats. They're eating bats. They're eating roaches. They're eating every fucking thing. They can eat
*  That's gonna give them some protein. They're not just eating like
*  canadian geese
*  Oh stuffed goose look they got the recipe from vanity fam
*  You know
*  They're eating bats bro flying rats
*  Can you imagine like if bats were good at all? Let's face it. We'd be eating them
*  I read a terrible story about these two scientists that had decided they wanted to
*  um
*  Do some studies on these rats that lived in this very particular cave
*  I believe it was in africa and they set up these cameras to photograph these rats that these bats rather that as the sundown
*  Would happen that's when the bats would start flying out of the caves and they were going to be there to capture it
*  Well what they didn't understand for whatever fucking reason is that this is also where the bats defecate
*  So the bats as they were flying over covered them with bat shit
*  Covered them and they I believe they both died of some sort of a hemorrhagic virus
*  Yeah
*  We'll have jamie find that out next that is bat shit crazy
*  You son of a bitch
*  Do you know that bat shit comes from?
*  The fact that bat shit used to be worth a lot of money because the guano bat guano is actually really good fertilizer. Oh wow. Yeah
*  But I bet bat shit crazy is probably like a disease that you get when you're hanging around all that bat guano
*  That makes sense because that stuff is valuable like people
*  Apparently really used to value it in terms of like using it as fertilizer using it when they're growing plants
*  I just know it from uh from ace ventura right he tastes it
*  Yeah, that's right. That's a
*  That's a underrated movie go back and watch that movie again, especially when you're high. It's so ridiculous
*  Yeah, i've been watching so much shit. It's been so fun that part of it just getting to absorb art
*  I've watched every adam sandler mover movie ever except little nicky. I didn't watch little nicky
*  It's when he plays the devil's kid. Yeah
*  I don't know about that one, but i've watched all of them. You watched the one with the remote control
*  Yes, I watched that one click. Yeah, I watched all of them. Huh, is that what it's called? Is it called click?
*  Yeah, yeah, happy gilmore's classic dude classic. So funny classic. He's got a lot of classics man
*  That one scene that there's something about that one scene where he's talking with chubbs
*  and
*  and he like just met chubbs and this and that and
*  He he's shooting cans into the trash can and he hits chubbs's wooden hand out into the street
*  And chubb says it's all right super durable made a great wood
*  Crushes it
*  Destroys me and then the next scene it shows chubbs with
*  Missing fingers on his wooden hand
*  Kills me, you know, you know, i'm not really
*  that much into comedy movies now that i'm grown up but one
*  that
*  Destroys me at my spinal cord that I don't know when the last time you saw it, but it holds up great
*  Kingpin. Oh kingpin's amazing. Oh my god just the scene when witty harrelson's throwing up after he had sex with the lady
*  Yeah
*  Yeah
*  And bill murray at the end the entire flow of action with his hair
*  And the comb over and how they capture it. Holy shit. It's a farrelly brothers movie, right?
*  Yeah
*  And I did I did punch up recently on a farrelly brothers project and I actually was talking with um with peter farrelly
*  And I go, you know
*  Because it like came up somehow kingpin came up and I go, you know, I think bill murray should have been nominated
*  For you know, best comedic or supporting or whatever, you know that category would have been and he actually goes, you know
*  It's funny. I've always thought that in the back of my mind and it never happened, but I completely agree with you there
*  It's one of the greatest comedic performances anyone that i've ever worked with is done. It really is bill murray's amazing, too
*  I watched uh groundhog day again. I haven't seen that in forever. It's fucking great. It's a great movie. It's really fun. Yeah
*  The farrelly brothers also made something about mary. That's another there's you know, steve sherrippa from the sopranos
*  Yeah, did you ever work for him when he was a booking guy? No, he used to book the riviera
*  When I worked the riviera, I used to get the gig through steve sherrippa
*  Steve sherrippa was a friend of mine before he did any acting drew carrie got him on the drew carrie show and then
*  One time I worked for him and he's telling me that drew carrie had him on his tv show. Oh, that's fucking awesome
*  Next thing, you know, the fucking sopranos come out and i'm walking at tv
*  And steve sherrippa's on I can't remember if I found out before I think I found out beforehand
*  But I couldn't believe it when I was watching I was like, I can't believe that's steve sherrippa and he's really fucking good
*  Really good and really fucking good actor
*  That is that is so weird that that like you knew that guy like that
*  His role when he had a regular job him taking care of uncle jr on the sopranos is
*  Masterful. He's not that fat by the way. That's a fat suit really. Yeah, they put a big old fat suit on him
*  Give him a big guy. He's a huge guy. Wow
*  I was there with steve sherrippa. I was working some guy lit his cigarette
*  Smoked it and then put it out on the floor
*  Of the carpet in the commie store in the comedy room in the riviera
*  And I stopped I thought steve sherrippa was gonna kill this guy
*  He's screaming at him pointing at his face pick it up. You fucking slob. That's crazy
*  So first thing I got here is a I was trying to find like a menu for pricing from a wet market
*  This is the closest I could get as a tweet showing some some sort of translation from it. Okay, but photo from the doban
*  What's that word mean?
*  doban of a menu
*  In wuhan hunan seafood market don't know when it was taken
*  But there are they sell all kinds of wild animals including oh my god, including live wolf pups
*  And palm civets. Holy shit, you can eat a wolf pup
*  What the fuck man second photo taken after outbreak discovered shows this storefront third left covering the word for
*  Wild in its name
*  So I was trying to get some sort of translation of what's on there
*  uh
*  koala meat deer meat
*  They have live sea kadir. That's six thousand. I don't know if it's yen or yuan. Why uan?
*  It's about 850 bucks
*  You can get a live sitka deer crocodile tongue is about 45. That's about six dollars 650 or so
*  Wow camel meat 25. Oh my god
*  bull testicles 12
*  I don't know the accuracy of all this translation, but that's what I just found in here. So
*  This is what happens when
*  You you need to eat man. You got to feed a fucking billion people
*  I will say though. It also said that the wet markets are not actually that popular in big cities
*  Like they're not even that many people that eat there. So I don't know how
*  Prevalent it is there if it's something maybe in raw areas, I don't i'm not sure dude
*  That's even worse news because that means the meat's gonna sit around for a while and cook
*  And it's all just gonna funk in the sun and all the bacteria is gonna jump from one fish to one frog to one
*  cockroach
*  Scary and on top of that if you cough too much the guys in hazmat suits drag you away
*  No one will ever see you again
*  Crazy dude
*  Like if you found out that china
*  was
*  Taking people that were sick and dragging them away and they were never heard from again. Would you believe that?
*  Yeah, let me ask you this journalists you know, that's true, yeah
*  If there's if you complain too much about china
*  They grab you they grab you they drag you. Yeah, they put you in a cell somewhere. They take you away
*  Happens all the time guys get prison sentences
*  for talking shit about
*  the the people in charge
*  It's a weird place man. Like this is the people that we have an antagonistic relationship with look at all these bats
*  Russia's even weirder though because they don't even uh, they don't even like hide it
*  Listen, they just keep saying people are falling out of windows in russia these doctors and it's like no
*  I don't think a doctor fell out of a window, especially three in one week. Yeah, three doctors fell out
*  Whoops, they're not even trying like it's like they could make it look like it's a suicide
*  What do you think the doctors did?
*  I think they uh cooking this lizard. How weird is that?
*  Cooking this lizard how weird is that?
*  Is that snake python? Yeah, jesus christ. They're cooking it with a blowtorch and then they just give it to you in a bag
*  Here
*  Have some python, you know, it's weird pythons are they really want to get rid of them
*  They're they're a huge problem particularly in florida where they're oh my god. Those are heads batsu. That's bat heads
*  Look at the teeth and shit. Yes
*  Oh jesus
*  What was I just talking about
*  I got thrown off by that
*  Uh pythons. Oh, yeah, so you can't buy python skin products anymore, but yet they're trying to kill all the pythons in the everglades
*  Like it's actually a resource like if you let people buy python skin in california
*  You would actually be contributing to getting rid of the pythons that are filling
*  The the the whole everglades has a giant problem in that these pythons these wacky people
*  In florida got and then released they've become breeders and they were introduced into this environment that doesn't have any defense mechanisms for them
*  There's nothing that knows what a python is they didn't evolve to get away from pythons or deal with pythons
*  So because of that everything's getting wiped out everything like they're down to like no raccoons
*  They have no bunnies anymore all the deer are missing. They're starting to eat alligators
*  They've caught a bunch of them like huge pythons with alligators inside. They're eating alligators, bro
*  They're the top of the food chain when it comes to florida and they're not even from there. So they're eating everything
*  And they're huge. They're huge predatory serpents. And so people are catching them
*  They're catching these 20 foot long ones. Just just hanging out in the everglades with a 20 foot long murderous python from another continent
*  Oh my god, but you can't even buy like if you're if you wanted to buy a python jacket
*  You can't buy that you piece of shit. What do you want to use python skin? That's exotic you asshole
*  But that's getting rid of the pythons if you buy it. Yeah, and and also they're murderous little heartless reptiles
*  You it's okay to have sheep skin
*  But it's not okay to have python. That's bananas. That doesn't make any sense like it's okay to eat meat
*  It's okay to wear leather cows seem super peaceful
*  Snakes will eat your baby. Yeah, leave your baby in a field with a python you come back
*  You got a fat python and no baby. They just eat things. They'll eat your baby. They don't give a fuck
*  They don't say well, I gotta deal with people me and people have a pact. I'm not gonna eat them at all
*  They make cobra condoms, I think they're thick I don't think you want that on your deck. That's true
*  Yeah
*  I don't even understand their their digestive system like what what happens there?
*  I mean, it's all the same. It's all just a tube
*  Yeah, where's the heart on the florida website about removing pythons? There's three ways to do it
*  They tell you okay using a captive bolt gun
*  A bolt gun a firearm or decapitation
*  Oh, Jesus a firearm bunch of fucking yeehaws out there in the swamps
*  Listening to lennard skinner music and shooting shotguns that actually sounds like fun. That sounds like a new reality show
*  God does that sound like yeah lizard king snake go out there to shoot some snakes
*  Yeah, they need a fucking a snake master a snake show
*  That's it for sure. The most humane way is immediate loss of consciousness and destruction of the brain humane
*  What are you talking i'm trying to kill snakes i'm trying to kill them the best way I can
*  You can do it anytime you want on private lands it says with landowner permission
*  What's interesting is I think if given enough time they're going to kill everything and then they're going to run out of food
*  And they're going to die off
*  Or they're going to start invading the way in the cities
*  They kill kids all the time like when people leave a python in a room with their baby those horror stories
*  I've read a bunch of those the python drops down and kills a baby
*  I've heard it even like a python comes from a neighboring apartment drops down through the ceiling and kills a kid
*  fuck
*  Bro
*  bro
*  Imagine you're getting wrapped up by a python
*  And you see the face coming over your head and you realize what's going on and it's clamping down your head and it detaches
*  His jaw and it's spreading around you're like, oh my god, you can't move your arms
*  You think your shoulder's broken you're getting squeezed as it's doing this and it's got its mouth on your fucking head
*  And it's slowly starting to take you into its body
*  I get scared of animals that like aren't even threatening like I get scared of like squirrels and whatnot if they look at me the wrong way
*  if they're right next to you in a tree and they some of those things pretend like
*  Because I live right next to a really awesome park and I run through there almost every day
*  And some of these squirrels they're like people squirrels. I guess they must get fed a lot or something from humans walking by
*  And they will pretend like they're going to like they will just get right up in your face
*  Aggressive squirrel I got scared at my chair in my hallway the other day. I thought
*  this was so stupid, but I was coming out of the bathroom was the end of the night and
*  My chair I have this one extra chair that sort of like moves around the living room
*  anyway
*  It ended up at across the end of the hallway and it was just sort of hanging out
*  And for some reason it sort of looked like there was like a crazy person
*  Like he thought your chair was a person you got scared. Super scared
*  Like like the type of scared because I thought it was a person leaning back smiling and immediately my brain registered that as if there's
*  Someone leaning back smiling in your living room. You're completely fucked. You've got real issues, right?
*  Like my and so my heart it literally like felt like it was like i'm like fuck here goes the next seven minutes
*  Did you just watch the joker?
*  No, you thought some crazy person was in your house
*  No, no, I had not just watched the joker, but I did watch but you're scared of squirrels as well you were saying
*  Yeah, I mean they they can be freaky. They can they can they can act a fool, you know
*  You know what it is. I think um, I think a lot of people feed squirrels
*  Yeah, there's a park in north hollywood
*  I remember going there once and watching this old dude on his back
*  And he would just lay on his back and pick up peanuts and hold them and the squirrels would come over and put their hands on
*  His hand and then take the peanut and run away with it
*  They did it all the time and they wouldn't even go that far
*  They'd go a few feet from him and just start eating their peanut and then other squirrels would come by
*  and they apparently had some sort of a
*  They they've been doing it so often
*  People know they could just if as long as you're not making much movement you look safe and hold it out there
*  They'll come get it from you
*  But did you see the video of the fucking monkey riding a motorcycle? Yes that pulls up and tries to steal a baby
*  Unbelievable if you haven't seen this this is the most 2020 video you will ever see it is 2020 encapsulated
*  Like this is so fucking mad the world's gone. Here's a monkey on a motorcycle
*  That goes zipping up the street bails off the motorcycle and tries to steal a baby
*  My favorite part of it is I I watched it like 20 times in a row
*  and I I love how the guy taking the video from his
*  Top story apartment like is laughing it starts and you don't see the monkey
*  And then he sees the monkey on the motorcycle and he starts laughing and he's laughing more as it gets closer
*  And he even laughs one more beat when the monkey grabs the kid because he's like, haha, you know, like he's like here it goes
*  Watch here's the monkey on the motorcycle bails and grabs the kid throws the kid to the ground
*  It's a little baby and starts dragging away tries to steal him and then he wants to eat the baby
*  Yeah, it's like a horror movie at that part dude and that guy runs out chasing after the monkey monkeys will kill you and eat you
*  That's a fact
*  If you're a baby in particular monkey kills 12 day old baby after snatching it from his breastfeeding mother and family home
*  Bro, where is that at? Where'd that take place?
*  Oh my god, what does it say there?
*  in india
*  Oh my god
*  The latest warning sign that primates are being forced into cities to search for food amid environmental destruction
*  This is november of 2018. Oh, I know I just no no no, I know no i'm saying imagine what they're like now
*  I was gonna say because did you see that thing about what's going on in thailand where there was nobody in the street?
*  So there was just like hordes of monkeys running through the street that are starving that are used to tourists feeding them
*  So they're just hordes of monkeys running through like where the fuck is everybody? Where's all the food?
*  Bro, it's crazy. Watch this
*  Crazy
*  It's so weird. It's so weird and then on top of that rats in new york city rats in new york city
*  There's no restaurants open anymore, right?
*  So the restaurants are not dropping off the normal amount of garbage and these rats are accustomed to it
*  Their whole ecosystem is dependent upon it. Look at this
*  Starving monkey gangs battle in thailand as coronavirus keeps tourists away. Look at that. Look at that fucking picture
*  Fuck the streets are filled with monkeys dude
*  If you're a little kid and you go wandering into that I guarantee you they will kill you and eat you guarantee you
*  You're a four-year-old kid you go stumbling to that. You're dead. They'll tear you apart
*  You know, they don't have rules
*  Such a strange animal like they're smart and they're sneaky like look at this video. Ah
*  No social distancing whatsoever
*  This is rats those are like rats. Yeah, they're so dangerous
*  Like they're not they don't give a fuck about you and they look mean
*  Some of them have mean faces because they've been used to other monkeys being mean to them and everything trying to eat them and kill them
*  Look at that fucking they tear this one apart
*  Oh my god
*  See, this is the thing about rats now rats are cannibalizing each other
*  These for sure they're going to kill babies and eat babies these these little
*  Crazy monkeys. Oh people are feeding them good better keep feeding them better feed them poison
*  Too many of them see how many monkeys that was? Yeah
*  So rats in new york apparently are cannibalizing each other. They're invading other rat territories taking over and just fighting
*  There's no fucking food for it. Great
*  So we'll know where when the next disease happens how it was made from rats eating each other in new york city
*  Oh my god, imagine if that's what it is
*  Imagine if that becomes the the big will smith movie plot line
*  Like this is how iam legend 2 begins the rats eat the other rats and they get some sort of mad rat disease
*  Because that's where mad cow disease came from it came from cows eating cows cows being fed cows
*  Rats eat a bunch of rat brains
*  They evolve
*  Fuck
*  Man
*  In all, um, honestly, I think we got a little too high before the show
*  Probably haven't done it in a while because we went down all the rabbit holes
*  That you go down when you're high
*  Yeah
*  Do you know anybody other than michael yo who caught coronavirus? No
*  No, and it makes me mad because like I it just doesn't feel that real to me
*  It seems like as many people as I know
*  I should know more and i'm asking people that I know if they know anybody and they don't know anybody
*  I know a few people you do. Yeah. I know I know uh, three four five
*  Six
*  Seven
*  Seven yeah, sturgeon got it. That's seven. I know I know a bunch of people that got it
*  Eight, I know eight. I know eight people that got it. Do they know how they got it just from hanging out or traveling?
*  Michael yo got it from new york. He went and flew down after he did my podcast and did gotham
*  And uh was I believe he was sick. He's gonna tell us next week
*  I believe he was sick and then he caught corona. I'm pretty sure and worn out because he was
*  Flying probably not much sleep. That's the weird thing to me is because I traveled so
*  Much december january and february pretty much continuously almost every single weekend and then obviously back
*  To la nothing's that short of a flight except for vancouver at the end of january
*  and like
*  You know, there's a lot of I have i have chinese friends there was obviously chinese people on the plane
*  I helped one lady that was that seemed sick. It was like my good deed that I was doing
*  I was like being a nice guy. She was sitting right next to me and she was sniffling and coughing
*  And I got on the wi-fi on um
*  On my phone and she basically signaled to me like she pointed at the wi-fi signal at the top of my phone and was like
*  Pointing at her phone and i'm like, all right, i'll figure it out
*  But it wasn't an iphone so I had a lot of trouble and I was touching it more than I wanted to and then
*  I couldn't get on her wi-fi and then she pulled out an ipad
*  That wasn't an actual ipad. It was another like whatever motorola brand or whatever, you know
*  And i'm there I am touching that i'm like fuck this is not and she was sick
*  Yeah, and it was stupid of me
*  And again, this is like before corona was mainstream news in january or whatever
*  But like i'm like god damn it. I just wanted to help this lady real quick now. It's taken forever and it
*  Wasn't even able to get her on the wi-fi, but I thought to myself when this all came out
*  I'm like I probably had it then
*  And just blew through it because I don't really ever get the flu or get sick
*  My body just like gets rid of everything in like a few hours normally
*  Um from all the pasta study shows that the more pasta you eat the better your body fights diseases
*  And um, but then I found out from the test today that i've never had it
*  Yeah, I thought I had it. Well, everybody thinks they had it. Everybody has this thing. Oh, yeah
*  I remember that time. Here's the thing all those other colds are still around folks
*  This is one thing that people have to really pay attention to
*  Like I almost hope they don't pay attention to it
*  I hope this there's some sort of a cure and everybody relaxes their their grip on fear
*  Because if they really start paying attention to all the things that are killing all the people all the time
*  It's a mess out there
*  It's a mess
*  and
*  The big one cigarettes
*  That's the big one. I was reading something today cigarettes might actually kill coronavirus. I'm like propaganda
*  Reefer madness
*  I smell a rat
*  I smell a rat
*  cigarettes might cigarettes might actually cure coronavirus nicotine, but there was a whole thing there was any of the people that smoke cigarettes and people that uh,
*  Vape might be more vulnerable. Remember that
*  I ignore those ones because I vaped so
*  I do I only read the pro uh vaping ones
*  But no, there are a few studies and I read one very early on in this that say nicotine is
*  Of assistance. They're not pro smoking or pro vaping but they are saying nicotine itself
*  Like yeah chew right patches chew
*  That stuff gets you high as fuck. Hell. Yeah, it does
*  That was my first buzz ever in my life and i'll never forget it
*  I fell on my butt at a 90 degree angle my legs stayed locked up and my back was straight. I lacked the um
*  The the knowledge of how to keep your dip in one place
*  I'm not good at packing it and keeping it in one place
*  It moves around my mouth and I went up swallowing a lot of it
*  You swallowed it when calvaries are so bad because I was a wreck and I was like, where's he spinning?
*  And then you just realized at the same time like I go. Oh, I forgot I swallowed it
*  You swallowed like the actual tobacco. Yeah, I took a big uh, big fucking plug of dip
*  Did it feel like you were gonna throw up after that? No
*  Uh, fortunately, wow. Yeah was nothing. It's no big deal. I mean, maybe I had like a little like
*  That feels weird but it's just plant matter
*  My body just digested it plant matter is one way of putting it
*  I think a lot of people would probably throw up. I was wondering if I was gonna get extra high
*  Yeah, because that's the thing about I remember the first time I ever smoked cigar. I was like, oh you get high from this
*  You guys are just on a different high. You're on a highway. You could definitely drive
*  You definitely talk normal. Yeah
*  but it's like um
*  It's pleasurable like the tobacco
*  Like pipe smoking or cigar smoking high. It's very pleasurable
*  Fuck yeah, it is. I mean this cigarettes are my favorite thing i've ever done in my life
*  It's been two years since I had one but I can say without any hesitation
*  It is my favorite thing if I ever find out I have a month or two to live i'm fucking
*  oh
*  I'm gonna smoke
*  Continuously, I won't even breathe normal air. I remember when Patrick Swayze was dying of pancreatic cancer
*  Hell yeah, and he kept smoking and people like wow
*  There's almost like they're mad at him. Like why would you do that when you're dying of cancer?
*  Yeah, well, why wouldn't you doing it when you're dying of cancer?
*  That's the time when you should smoke damn smoked up until the time you got cancer. But now that you got cancer
*  Smoke them if you got them pat. Fuck. Yeah, man
*  Coffee and a cigarette how many cigars michael jordan smoking during that last dance
*  Throughout the height of the 90s in his career smoked a lot of all of the time
*  Constantly, I know you're not a big basketball guy, but have you been watching that at all? No, I heard it's amazing though
*  Yeah, that's one where I literally thought of you during this last one and i'm like, I know joe
*  Isn't watching this because of basketball, but you would fucking love it
*  because um, especially this last one
*  Their coach phil jackson and his brain and the way he can motivate people. I mean it is
*  Fucking shocking and never out of everything i've ever watched have I paused something
*  And just thought about it for a few minutes and then hit play again and rewind again on a documentary. It's
*  Insane, well, he's a super winner, you know, yep. Those are always really interesting
*  Like anyone who's that driven to be such a winner like you stand out amongst winners as being so exceptional
*  That everybody like who's the goat michael jordan is always the first pick right? There's the there's
*  Wonder like how would lebron how would how would this that but everybody always says michael jordan
*  Like to be that much of a super winner you think about all the people that are playing basketball all the people that are around
*  Him that are world-class athletes professional athletes and he stands out amongst them
*  Well, he's so wildly competitive that he will beat you in your own game. He will ask you what you're playing
*  Yeah, if you were playing with something you go, what is that and he will
*  Immediately start and his only goal is to beat you at what you love and what you think you're good at
*  Whatever it is. So it just happens to be the basketball is the one that yeah he chose
*  But also then he got that way with shoes with like he's like, all right
*  Well, if i'm gonna sign a fucking shoe deal, then i'm gonna do this the right way
*  Doesn't he do that with golf too? Is he really in a gambling with golf everything?
*  Yeah, they were throwing they throw coins against a wall and he's gambling with the security guards and he can't wait to take
*  Their money he can't he cannot wait. He's talking shit
*  To these guys that are protecting him. That is so crazy
*  In a so crazy in a game where you throw try to get the closest to the wall with a quarter
*  He used to have a celebrity, uh pool tournament in chicago
*  Wow, yeah, he had a pool tournament that he did all the time like a charity pool tournament
*  And I heard if you beat him at pool, he hates you. Yeah, that sounds about right
*  The everything that i'm gathering from this documentary is that if you're a super
*  Soup, I mean, I mean not just a regular winner, but just a super
*  Winner, he's so off the charts as far as like to be that kind of an achiever
*  You have to have a madness about you. That's a probably intolerable for most people. Yeah, just the desire to win
*  Conquer in other days man. Those were gladiators in other days. Those were generals
*  You know, there's a lot of people that get into pro sports that it is it's really in a lot of ways
*  it's it it
*  Moves them away from war in the best way that we know how possible
*  But if we didn't have those if there was no sports and people just conquered each other
*  Those would be the kings of the world the football players that thor guy who just deadlifted the world record the game of thrones guy
*  Yeah, do you see that shit? Yeah
*  Deadlifted
*  1100 and something pounds barefoot
*  Looking barely like the same thing as you and I right like what is that? That's a person that's a person, too
*  Okay, what?
*  crazy, so bobby lee's a person
*  And that thor guy is a person too, they're the same thing the same thing
*  Wow, yeah, how the fuck
*  It's unbelievable did you watch the video of him lifting it
*  Oh the video tyson too. Yeah, that's crazy
*  Tyson apparently has decided that he wants to box in some charity boxing matches
*  So he put up some video of him hitting the pads
*  Oh my god, please tell me your vendor holyfield didn't say that he he wants to fight. Yeah. Oh my god
*  Look at this says are you ready the moment you've all been waiting for the champ is back
*  I'd like to announce i'll be making a comeback to the ring
*  I'm training to promote a charity that's very close to me our unite for our fight campaign aims to fill the void
*  The pandemic has created on access to resources our youth needs for emotional development and education
*  You imagine if mike tyson and a vander holyfield
*  Have a third fight when they're in their 50s. Wow, even if it's for charity, even if it's for charity
*  It might be that's what it's sounding like
*  For charity it might be that's what it's sounding like
*  Holy shit, you're right
*  That is exactly what it's sounding like
*  Look at the size of his traps
*  How ridiculous are those they go right to his shoulders go that hold on go to that picture again. His traps are ridiculous
*  Just look at that
*  Look at his traps
*  They just go straight to his shoulder
*  Evander holyfield was the first guy in modern boxing who employed like a really
*  rigorous
*  Weightlifting regime that allowed him to successfully go up
*  Michael spinks did it too when he beat larry holmes, but then he got destroyed by tyson
*  I mean he was really a light heavyweight that used his movement to outbox larry holmes when larry holmes was like sort of
*  getting close to the twilight of his career, but
*  That wasn't the case with evander like evander like became a heavyweight
*  He was the cruiserweight champ and you know, he was like a slim guy when he fought dwight mohammed kawii
*  And then when he went to be a heavyweight he filled he thickened up man. He he bulked up like purposely bulked up
*  Had some amazing strength and conditioning videos that they showed of all the different shit that he was doing
*  Right preparing like the way the guy worked out was insane
*  It came up in the jordan documentary too
*  He was like maybe 200 pounds for the first couple years of his career and then bulked up to 215
*  Solid muscle. Yeah, I heard it was after playing the pistons. They were they're real physical his trainer
*  He said would go back after every game and count the number of steps
*  He took with each foot in the direction he was taking so he would know how tired he should be
*  And what he should be doing for him the next day and whatnot. Oh my gosh
*  So he had left foot right foot left foot is back right foot's forward
*  He would play which is they don't do today
*  He played in all
*  All 82 games he was rarely ever hurt because he knew that people were coming which was true to see him play
*  And if he didn't give them that performance
*  He felt like he was cheating everyone and every time he would play
*  Anyone for the first time he needed to show like he could never ever let anyone ever
*  Make them feel like they got one over on him
*  So not only each game for the audience that are seeing him for the first time in which he needs to dominate
*  But especially towards his opponent who literally thinks that maybe maybe today will be my lucky day
*  You know i'm going up against jordan. This is you know, it's the middle of the season. He'll probably
*  He's not gonna he puts up 60 points or whatever in your face like embarrasses you you fall on the ground
*  He crosses you over he does everything that you know you get embarrassed
*  He would try to make a fool out of these people
*  I remember the first time I saw a photo of him. It looked like he had leapt from center court
*  flying through the air to dunk and i'm like
*  How does a human even do that? Yeah, how does a 200 plus pound human fly through the air like that?
*  And and you know even towards the end of his career they just showed one where it's the all-star game
*  So he got to go up against kobe bryant for the first time because they're in two different conferences that don't normally play
*  And kobe's this 18 year old that just you know went straight from high school to the mba
*  Completely dominating his side of things going up against jordan for the first time ever
*  And everybody on kobe's side is saying you know kobe asked us to let him have jordan and jordan's on his side
*  They have actual footage. That's what's crazy about this documentary is that somehow this fucking camera crew
*  Jordan let them come along in the ride in this green room for all this crazy exclusive content
*  And he's saying to the guys he goes you guys all know this is in uh, not the green room
*  But the locker room before you guys you guys all know this kid's coming after me, right?
*  Like he's gonna want me so let me have him ba ba ba ba because he wants to show the kid and sure enough
*  Even though kobe's 18 and peak peak peak physical condition
*  jordan wins the mbp of that all-star game
*  crushing it against a
*  Young kobe bryant. Well, how crazy was he he decided in the middle of all that? I'm just gonna play baseball
*  Yeah, i'm just gonna be the best at baseball that comes up
*  He gets there's they go deep into which is interesting how the media and a not a social media time period was
*  Fucking hammering him because they built him up to be this young guy out of north carolina
*  olympic superstar
*  Killing literally scored more points than anybody's ever scored as a rookie in the mba all this attention and now he's the man
*  And they started like beating him down with some of the gambling stuff
*  He was doing it got out leaked out and then just added attention and he's like, you know, fuck this i'm gonna quit
*  I'm out see ya quit. Wow
*  Because of all the negative attention. That's what they said interesting makes sense
*  Well, that's what happens when you become that guy
*  There's so much interest like to
*  To be that guy first of all you have to have a fire burning inside you
*  Like most people will never be able to comprehend and a guy like that's going to be into other kinds of wild shit
*  Too like gambling he's gonna want to have thrills, you know, he's gonna drive fast cars. He's got he's a wild man
*  a wild man at the peak of like one of them
*  I mean if you think about professional basketball you watch an mba game
*  And all the thought that's involved in which way you're going and the ability to explode and then the ability to in the middle of all that
*  land a
*  Precision shot into a hole. There's really not another sport like that. I mean baseball is uh, you're trying to
*  Hit something that's coming at you like crazy
*  You're swinging as fast as you can and there's a lot of skill to that as well
*  Obviously and there's a lot of skill to pitching but there's something unique about basketball
*  And that in all this chaos you got to find stillness in all this chaos
*  You got to find the ability to stop and throw a perfect shot off. So it's not just
*  Incredible physical ability. It's incredible physical ability and then touch. Yep. It's real weird
*  Yeah, it's a very interesting sport in that way. It requires you to have your shit together
*  Yeah
*  Like to execute that shot you have to have your shit together and you have to have mad practice
*  Like one of the things that I used to love about growing up in boston was uh, larry bird stories
*  Like larry bird was apparently just an insanely disciplined
*  Professional basketball player he would get there and practice before everybody stay after everybody practice things left and right
*  And when they would have those three-point competitions remember we'd have those all-star three-point competitions in the locker room
*  He just would which one of you guys is coming in second?
*  Let's see what they just walk in
*  but it was just because he
*  First of all, he could execute under pressure and two he was just better
*  He could do things better than most people and even he
*  Said sometimes he thought it was god pretended to be michael jordan. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's how good michael jordan was
*  Every single legend is completely they have such good interviews with one with everybody imagine
*  They have such great stories. It's crazy how
*  You know, i've always said a documentary has the potential to destroy
*  to
*  Be better than any other type of story whether it be a movie or a book because if it's unbelievable
*  It's like the tiger king if it's fucking amazing and it's real you can't beat it. You can't beat it and uh,
*  That's what the last dance is doing. It's crazy. I don't know if you have a uh,
*  A vpn or not, but you can reset on netflix. It's on around the world
*  So you can watch it. Yeah, if you read if you set your location, you can watch it
*  Is one of my sponsors. Yep, they show you that so yep ours too. So where are you getting it from?
*  I just I go to my express vpn and I set my location for somewhere else. What do you set it for?
*  Usually, I don't know germany or switzerland or whatever. You can just openly say that on the internet. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  and then I go on netflix
*  and uh
*  No commercials just binge it. It's why don't they have it on netflix here? It's uh, espn netflix co
*  It's literally such a great documentary that they had to work their own like first ever super deal espn and netflix
*  Does espn plus have it on their their app? Okay. I have that even done yet
*  I heard they're still editing the final episode or whatever like they had to rush it out
*  Yeah, I don't it's interesting because like do you want to be that guy?
*  First of all, you probably can't but second of all, even if you could do you want to be that guy?
*  Do you want to be so driven and obsessed?
*  maniacal in it
*  I don't know. It's a good question. I think he's pretty happy. Oh, he's pretty fucking amazing
*  Don't get me wrong, but i'm saying like the the the first of all you wouldn't be that guy
*  Like it's a special fire that burns in that guy. Yeah, most people just do not have you don't have it
*  Right, but would you trade it?
*  Would you trade would you want to be the obsessed winner?
*  Is it too much pressure?
*  It's too weird to want to be that person who just wins wins wins wins
*  Just dunking on people the fucking his logo is him flying through the air ready to dunk on people
*  There's a lot of times he was doing things specifically to shit on the general manager
*  That was like in control of the team. Oh my god, like bringing a new player
*  Like i'll watch what we're about to do to this fucking guy
*  You think that you and he was just they shit on him all the bully him
*  They said because this little guy jerry krauss
*  And they really fucking bully him and that's coming from me and i'm I look at the
*  The way that he insults this gm is ruthless
*  It is insane man. It is not it's not even funny
*  But don't that's what if you want to make money off that guy
*  That's what you want. You want a guy who is not is not rational about it. He's just insane
*  But then again, okay
*  Then you get a guy like wayne gretzky
*  it's like arguably one of the best hockey players of all time yet
*  almost universally
*  Treated as like a really nice guy
*  Yeah, well, he's canadian. Oh, that's what it is
*  We don't count those kind in the nice department
*  Do you see that canada banned assault weapons? They banned all assault weapons. There's like a two-year grace period
*  You got like two years and you got to turn in your ar-15s
*  That is uh, not making the the gun people here happy
*  Very very upset and people are pointing something out, too
*  This is like a video of a canadian sheriff discussing it and he said out of all the shootings that i've ever been a part of
*  Where there's illegal activity like that and uh horrible crimes that are being committed. He goes it's never with a licensed gun over
*  The these aren't licensed gun owners. These people that got these guns
*  Um, they're gonna get these guns
*  Illegally anyway, just because they're not legal doesn't mean they're not they're gonna do an illegal thing
*  They don't need a legal gun to do an illegal thing. And if you think that some all you're gonna do is make it more difficult
*  and more money
*  Uh for the gun runners, it's gonna for sure it's gonna be something where it's more risky for them
*  But it's also gonna be more profitable. It's gonna be hard to get a gun over there, but people are still gonna do it
*  They bring coke in from south america. They're gonna bring guns into canada
*  It's gonna happen, but only the criminals are gonna have them now
*  Yeah, getting an illegal assault weapon is the nicest thing anybody getting an assault weapons doing. Yes, exactly
*  Perfectly put that's exactly what it is
*  It's just um, I wish there was a world where we didn't need guns
*  I wish for sure but that's not this world
*  Doesn't mean you don't love people just means like you gotta look at things practically
*  You can't look at things the way you want them to be you gotta look at things the way they are
*  The way they are is there's more guns than there are people
*  And to say you can't have a gun anymore. It's like, okay
*  Well who gets to have a gun and who's gonna take the guns away?
*  And what are we going to do about the constitution and why when can we vote on this?
*  Or should this be a part of the bill of rights where this is how we are and this is how this country is established
*  Is it things we agree on we don't want to vote on whether or not we have free speech. We need free speech
*  Should we vote on whether or not we have the second amendment? Some people say no some people say
*  What we're dealing with is a mental health problem. We're not dealing with a gun problem
*  The gun problem is that the mentally ill people get the guns
*  It's not a gun problem and there's a lot of people that want to have guns to protect themselves from mentally ill people that are violent
*  And it's also the news again, there's a lot of this goes back to news for me and
*  And
*  them
*  Glorifying these people this is what they say. You know what I mean? They know they're gonna get the coverage
*  They know that their name is gonna get out there
*  Yeah, it's not it's not acceptable if we didn't do that then they wouldn't do that
*  Much more to me than the guns if we take away the guns if we have the guns like if we cover it differently
*  Things will be different without a doubt. It's true. But people want to know what the name of the guy who shot up the school
*  They don't get to know they broadcast that people find it online
*  I don't think they should like why would why would that be necessary? I don't know man
*  I think it's just one of those things about human nature
*  Like if there was a video of Tom Cruise falling off the back of a plane you would watch it if he fell to his death
*  He'd watch that video wouldn't you?
*  Well, yeah, if yeah if it leaks. Yeah, I think it's kind of along the same lines
*  Does that make sense?
*  Yeah, but I think that
*  I think that the government could help with that if they're going to
*  before I think before restricting guns, I think they could step in and
*  And then maybe run it by some psychiatrists and scientists and whatnot and see what they think about the media part of
*  a crime because again, I mean like these people want to be legends they want to be
*  It certainly has an effect. It certainly has an effect, you know, I watched this uh, this hitler documentary
*  And it talked about how ava brawn this applies to what we're talking about. If I mentioned
*  Ava brawn didn't have to go to the bunker to die with hitler
*  And this person said that she did it because she knew that by doing that against hitler's wishes
*  That she would inevitably die with hitler and therefore because she was kept behind the scenes and on the back burner so much
*  Become a bigger part of history
*  So she could have decided to live a normal life maybe get prosecuted later or whatever
*  But sort of live or go to prison or whatever
*  Or go to the bunker and die with hitler and be
*  Part of history forever and be represented as the woman that was with hitler
*  Have you ever paid attention to all of the information that's out there about how many nazis fled germany and went to south america?
*  Yeah, dude
*  Tim kennedy used to have a show called uh, was it finding hitler i've seen hitler. Yep. I've watched all those hitler
*  They were they were operating under this premise. The premise was hitler never died in germany
*  He was snuck out of the country in a submarine or some shit and they they brought him to south america
*  Well, you know that there's no real evidence that's true
*  But what there is evidence is a lot of fucking people that live in south america used to be nazis including like kennedy had
*  He was on the show and he was talking about finding these people going into their homes
*  And they have pictures of nazi soldiers like lovingly framed on their wall
*  Like this is grandpa back in fucking
*  Buchenhof or wherever those places are. Yeah
*  Auschwitz, what is it? What is the uh buchenwald? Is that how you say it?
*  Which one buchenwald?
*  Everybody always remembers auschwitz. Yeah
*  But I mean imagine going into someone's house and you see a a nazi guard on the wall with an ss on his sleeve
*  And you're like, holy shit
*  This is a nazi officer and this is your grandpa
*  And then you realize like oh my god these
*  This community, I mean they have octoberfest there where they're all german and they're all drinking beer and wearing lederhosen and shit
*  It's wild how many times germany almost won that like a few different little tweaks of decisions
*  And they
*  Win that war well, they're being led by a madman. Yeah, I mean he was they were he was doing things that they didn't expect
*  One of the things that I had read about russia was when they had invaded russia
*  They knew that they were coming but they they estimated it was going to take a certain amount of time
*  But they didn't think they were going to march 24 hours
*  Right, they were not going to sleep. They didn't take any rest. They just took speed so they got there earlier than anybody expected
*  Yeah
*  and also while going through france they went through uh
*  They went through the forest instead of the plains. They were waiting for them
*  on both
*  Sides of the openings and they just fucking took their tanks and went right through just found a way to treach through
*  The forest and trees build their own path and they snuck up behind both of the other sides of their other armies
*  God was wild you imagine
*  the horror of experiencing that
*  During world war two where you were getting your newspapers. That's all you're getting for information, right back then world war two
*  I mean how much stuff was on television very few things on television, right? Radio though. They had radio
*  So you'd get you'd get your radio reports
*  From the front lines in nazi germany and you would get that kind of stuff and that that's how your your vision of the world would
*  Be and you imagine if you're over there and you see them coming through the forest with tanks
*  You're like, holy shit. They're real and here they come and the same thing then
*  Was that the news was bullshit. You know what I mean? They're feeding their people what they
*  A want to hear and b will come back to hear more of and c make them feel good about what's happening
*  one of the things that I saw was uh,
*  A
*  Commercial well, not really it's like a report, but it was also a commercial basically for their military
*  Um for the german military, it's two german soldiers in a bunker
*  Talking and they go. I can't wait to get back to my wife. Yeah, I know i'm gonna get back to my wife
*  They're speaking german, but it's being translated in the end the guy goes
*  Yeah, you know what to be honest with you
*  I think the russians are more scared of us than ever and they're more scared of us than we are of them
*  That's for sure and that was released like the week or two before the end when the russians are literally
*  In berlin like they're coming in full of
*  Thousands of tanks and all of this, you know all of this war material. They're about to hit the center of germany
*  and they're still germany's playing that on their
*  Radios and on their tvs or whatever every that's what's out there
*  Is literally I think the russians are more afraid of us than we are of them. Meanwhile, germany was done
*  They were crippled. They had at that point. They have their hitler youth is their last stand in the city
*  children
*  children
*  Firing weapons for the first time bazookas little kids firing fucking bazookas into the street
*  Against some russian tank by a professional russian tank soldier
*  Blowing everything up
*  What's really crazy that wasn't that long ago, right wasn't even a hundred years ago. Yeah, there's people that survived that that are alive right now
*  There's one guy he survived world war two and he survived covet
*  Wow
*  Yikes
*  They don't make people like that anymore
*  That's
*  I mean
*  When people think about war today
*  They only think about things that are happening somewhere else at a very small scale like the war in iraq to war in afghanistan
*  That's our perspective for most people's lives
*  Most people don't remember vietnam. They definitely probably most people don't
*  Really remember the experience of having someone fight in world war two that you loved some people maybe remember korea
*  But our experience of war is is almost uh, unless you're a soldier who's served overseas
*  Our experience is almost like abstract right like we know what happens but it's just one of those things it's over there
*  Sort of like pandemics like we know what happens, but it's just it's rare. We don't have to worry about it right now
*  But now we do that's how I feel about war like if it breaks out
*  If if war breaks out with china and all of a sudden there's like legitimate attacks on cities
*  And we're like, holy shit like we didn't think this was real
*  We didn't think that this was a real possibility
*  But all this time maybe that's why when people like obama get in office and they have a different perspective
*  On the campaign trail than they do once they actually get in office
*  Maybe they're presented with how many moving pieces around the table and how all this can go wrong at any time and how
*  This nation is trying to do this to this nation this nation has nukes and this and they're trying to get to us
*  And this is how they're doing it and then we found that they're listening to our bathrooms and they've got devices here
*  We found a new spy and like fuck man. Yeah
*  Dude war is a
*  Crazy thing. I remember how bad everybody
*  A lot of people were excited to go to war after 9 11, you know
*  And they built that storyline around it and everything
*  Well, we were also excited in in some ways because we just got through operation desert storm. That was a big hit
*  for you know, if that was um
*  If we were a band that was our stairway to heaven, right
*  Right such a fucking giant hit, you know, I mean we lost one one scud missile hit one
*  Barracks and killed a bunch of people but that's it
*  Most of it was just a decimation right a destruction by the american troops
*  So I think in some ways we might have had it in our head
*  This is something we're going to do like we did in desert storm. Just wipe them out real quick and that'll be over
*  Fuck here. We are the longest war ever in the history of the country
*  And we don't get out. We're still in it and there's arguments that we should stay in it
*  And some of them are good arguments
*  You're like fuck like is that what the world we're dealing with is like we were talking about before with with when it comes to people
*  There's so many things. It's not there's not one real clear answer of what you do
*  That's going to determine the best future for everybody
*  And you could listen to these experts tell you that you can listen to an expert tells you we don't want to be the policemen
*  Of the world we need to get out of everywhere now and concentrate on our own domestic issues and just use
*  policy and
*  Diplomacy to deal with the rest of the world and then there's other people that say they will blow us the fuck up
*  We have to monitor them. We have to keep an eye on them
*  There's a real hatred of the first of all, maybe some of it earned some of the shit we did in the past
*  Maybe there's some shady shit that's going on
*  You don't know about but the bottom line is we're gonna need to keep these bases
*  We need to keep this military presence and we don't want to go to war but trust us
*  you're like fuck it's been a while that sweden's been able to
*  Avoid all this the whole time a bunch of what started out as what basically vikings, right?
*  Right iceland too, right? They're not invading anybody anymore
*  They're neutral. They stayed and they were either they were able to avoid world war two
*  They just figured out how to do strongmen contests and appease those fucking gorillas get it out of your system lift some weights
*  So many of the strongmen come from iceland. You know that yeah, there was a vice documentary on it
*  They showed all these gigantic dude. They were oh my god. Oh look vikings giants
*  Imagine that giant with a battle axe storming through your fucking neighborhood. That's where the nordic track came from
*  Every now and then you miss
*  You're really good at this
*  some puns
*  Nordic tracker, right? You remember that thing? Is that still a thing? Yeah, I think so you do uh cross-country
*  Nobody ever used those right out of all of the exercise equipment that nobody ever used that was number one
*  Was that the chuck norris one? I think it was no chuck norris one was the total body system
*  Remember that one where his cables and he's going he pulls him down his body goes up and goes down and up
*  Was that called was it called total body system? It was him and christy brinkley, right?
*  Total body gym, I think or something one of them things total body something him and christy brinkley hanging on still sexy
*  At an elevated age. So that was the the that was like the hook like I want to be like that
*  They still got it christy still got it
*  Chuck norris still got it. Wasn't it christy brinkley am I imagining that?
*  No, I think you're right. I'm deep into the history of the nordic track right now
