# JRE MMA Show #159 with Quinton Rampage Jackson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcQG3PeMIaI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  What's up Quentin?
*  What's up man?
*  Good to see you sir.
*  Yeah, good to see you.
*  Cheers.
*  Good to be here.
*  So tell me about your drink.
*  What is this?
*  It's called F3?
*  Yeah, F3.
*  It's a newer energy drink.
*  It got like supplements and stuff in it.
*  Oh, this is good.
*  Yeah.
*  Ginseng, BCAAs, Theanine.
*  Okay, good for the brain.
*  What the hell is Theanine?
*  I don't even know what this is.
*  It's a nootropic.
*  It's in this gum.
*  This gum, neuro gum.
*  Yeah, I take a bunch of different brain supplements.
*  Does it make your dick hard though?
*  No, it doesn't help there.
*  Oh, I've been looking for this.
*  There's other stuff for that.
*  But how good would it be if you can drink Dick Hardener?
*  I'm sure they have it.
*  I'm sure there's like a Viagra soda somewhere.
*  Thailand or some shit.
*  I'm sure in Thailand.
*  Maybe Russia.
*  I'm sure there's some.
*  Jamie, Google Dick Harden soda.
*  You can get Carl to sit still for a second.
*  Can you think about that?
*  You don't have to take a pill.
*  You just drink it.
*  You know, the girls have no idea.
*  I bet there's like a cocktail that you can buy at a bar.
*  Why you call it cocktail though?
*  Well, that's what they called them.
*  I didn't invent it.
*  But if there was like a cocktail, yeah, that's what they would call it.
*  The cocktail.
*  I want to spit all over your table.
*  It's OK.
*  This table looks good with a little bit of stains on it.
*  Did you find anything?
*  I need Dick Hard soda.
*  It's giving me like cocktails that people have, you know, made that have Viagra in them.
*  They're just suggest.
*  No, no, they just have alcohol in there.
*  Call them like get your dick hard.
*  Oh, Viagra, Viagra Falls.
*  But there's no sodas or anything with Viagra in them?
*  No, no, no.
*  But there's no sodas or anything with Viagra.
*  That would probably have to be in another country.
*  Yeah, they probably wouldn't have that here.
*  Because you have to have a prescription.
*  That's the only thing this needs.
*  They got everything else.
*  And it's green tea.
*  That's where the caffeine comes from.
*  Green tea.
*  And ginseng too.
*  Yeah, I can drink like two or three of these a day.
*  It don't bother me.
*  I love it.
*  That's nice.
*  The first time I saw you fight was in like 2000.
*  Yeah, about 2000.
*  I saw you fight Marvin Eastman.
*  My first fight, my first professional fight?
*  Was that your first professional fight?
*  Yeah, you saw that.
*  Yeah.
*  And Kaynter Cage.
*  Yup.
*  I was there.
*  You was there at Kaynter Cage.
*  Yup.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  You saw me get my ass kicked.
*  You didn't get your ass kicked.
*  I did.
*  No, you just lost.
*  Yeah.
*  I lost by the way.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah.
*  They was doing him a favor.
*  And they told me the guy was just a kickboxer.
*  You know, I was a wrestler.
*  I was like, oh, I'm just going to take this guy down.
*  It was a two weeks notice fight.
*  Oh wow.
*  Yeah.
*  He kickboxed too.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't know about the wrestling.
*  I knew he was a kickboxer.
*  He kicked me in the head.
*  I was like, damn, that's my only time ever getting kicked in the head.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, my whole career.
*  Go back and watch my fights.
*  That's crazy.
*  I learned a lesson.
*  Never got kicked in the head again.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, he could wrestle and he could kickbox.
*  And he was built like a tank.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why he was my first fight in the UFC.
*  Because I don't know if you know about this, but Dana White bought an organization just
*  to get me because I left Pride and I went to WFA.
*  Oh, okay.
*  And my manager at the time, he became like the president of WFA.
*  So he had to stop being my manager.
*  And I fought and then the company folded.
*  And Dana bought the whole company so I can come over.
*  So this was when you were leaving Pride, when UFC had bought Pride?
*  This was before.
*  Oh.
*  I left Pride right when it was going down.
*  When the UFC bought Pride, they thought they were buying a whole organization.
*  And they didn't get anything but a library.
*  They got a video library.
*  That's all they got?
*  All the contracts were bullshit.
*  Everything was bullshit.
*  That's why they never got Fador.
*  And that's why I think, well, it's like they honored people's contracts.
*  Some people got great contracts.
*  Like Mark Hunt apparently got a great contract.
*  Alistair, a lot of these guys that came over had great contracts.
*  But Crow Cop, remember Crow Cop came over?
*  But it was, the whole thing was all fucked up.
*  You know, it was run by the mob.
*  Yeah, it was crazy.
*  What was it like being over there?
*  Man, it was crazy.
*  It was surreal.
*  I remember the first time I noticed that the mob had something to do with Pride.
*  I saw these guys walking down the hallway when we was doing the piss test.
*  And I was coming back from the bathroom with my cup.
*  And I just see these guys walk around in nice expensive suits.
*  And then everybody just put their head down, put their back against the wall and just bow.
*  Whoa.
*  I was like, what the fuck is going on?
*  You know, culture shock. I had no idea.
*  Right.
*  And then after a while I asked somebody, like, oh, those are the bosses.
*  Those are the Yakuza.
*  Did they have missing fingers?
*  Some of them did.
*  You see some of that shit over there.
*  Bro, that is a crazy way to gain entry.
*  Fucking saw your finger off.
*  I thought that if you did something bad.
*  Yeah, if you fucked up, right?
*  I had a friend out there.
*  His name was 36.
*  And the guy took a liking to me.
*  And he was super cool.
*  All tatted up.
*  And I guess he was rich as fuck.
*  When he found out I had like little Japanese kids, he said, hon, your son needs this.
*  And he, it was like a gold samurai helmet.
*  He said, this has to stay in your son's house.
*  And I showed it to my ex-wife.
*  She was my wife at the time.
*  She said, oh yeah, I was going to have to get him this.
*  He saved me a lot of money.
*  And I asked her, I said, how much is something like this called?
*  She said, probably like $30,000 to $40,000.
*  Wow.
*  He gave me a gift.
*  He had like a missing.
*  Missing pinky finger.
*  Yeah.
*  But he was a cool dude.
*  What do they do?
*  They chop off one digit or two?
*  How many digits did they chop off?
*  I think he just had the first.
*  Chopped off the first.
*  Yeah.
*  They just had the first one chopped off.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, if you fuck up again, then it's the second one.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe it would go to the other hand.
*  I would think.
*  I don't think you would fuck up no more after that though.
*  Would you fuck up twice?
*  I mean, you don't fuck up on purpose, I would assume.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You never know about that.
*  I mean, it depends on how strict they are.
*  What is a fuck up for those guys?
*  You have no, I have no idea.
*  It's a crazy culture.
*  It's crazy.
*  I love it though.
*  I could live there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I could, you know, their population is dying off.
*  They ain't making babies.
*  They're actually asking people to come over there and fuck.
*  Man.
*  The fuck I'm doing here?
*  I just got back from there.
*  I was trying to fuck, you know, I was trying to be good because, you know, I'm trying
*  to, you know, see somebody.
*  I was trying to be good so I ain't fuck nothing.
*  I ain't fuck nothing this time.
*  This is the first time I'm going to Japan, I ain't fuck nothing.
*  Like, God damn.
*  I'm trying to be good for once in my life.
*  Do they love Americans over there?
*  Oh, wow.
*  Tell me, tell me you've been there though.
*  I've only been there for one day, just for the UFC and right back home.
*  How could you do that?
*  How could you go there?
*  Just, that's a long flight.
*  I had to.
*  Too busy.
*  Yeah.
*  I just didn't have any time for anything else, but it was beautiful.
*  It's interesting how clean everything is.
*  So clean and orderly.
*  Yeah.
*  And everybody like, so many people walking on the street, nobody's bumping into anybody.
*  Everybody's like very polite.
*  Yeah, they're very polite, but they're like robots, bro.
*  I remember one time when I was fighting there, and this one guy on the other side of the
*  street recognized me, but he wasn't sure.
*  He was riding a bike, and he was looking at me.
*  It wasn't paying attention to where he was going, and he fucking smacked in the back
*  of the truck and fell down on his bike.
*  We all was laughing our ass off, but the Japanese people, no one laughed.
*  No one tried to help him up.
*  And none of them.
*  He was hurt kind of bad, and I would have went over there and tried to help him, but
*  it was like a busy street.
*  Nobody even helped him?
*  No one even helped him.
*  They just kept walking.
*  Just kept walking.
*  One dude stepped over him.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Just kept walking.
*  No one laughed though.
*  That's the thing that fucked me up.
*  We was laughing our ass off.
*  You don't hear about a lot of Japanese comedians.
*  No, I heard that the ones that they do have, they come from Osaka, not Tokyo.
*  Oh, Osaka's looser?
*  Yeah.
*  I've been to Osaka before, and they laugh and crack jokes.
*  You know, I married a Japanese woman, right?
*  So, I kind of learned a little bit about them.
*  They're very serious.
*  Really?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Especially in Tokyo.
*  They're very serious.
*  You got to be careful with jokes and stuff.
*  She learned to be funny after a couple years of being with me, and then she started joking.
*  Then she actually got pretty good.
*  I'm like, damn, she started hurting my feelings a little bit.
*  What the fuck did I create?
*  But she was good.
*  I remember one time we was joking back and forth, and she was laughing.
*  Then I made a joke about her dad, and she's like, don't you talk about my father.
*  I was like, damn, my bad.
*  I thought we was joking.
*  So, they just take everything serious.
*  They don't understand the concept of jokes.
*  You know, our movies, our comedy movies don't go there to Japan.
*  Just our action movies and stuff.
*  Interesting.
*  You didn't know that?
*  No.
*  Makes sense though.
*  They just, a different culture.
*  They're more stoic.
*  Just a completely different society.
*  Yeah, but I'm going to go over there and make a whole bunch of babies though.
*  They need me.
*  They do.
*  They need me.
*  They do.
*  I'm going to make me a bunch of babies, and if they boys, put them in the MMA.
*  Yeah, I think they have like a drastic reduction in their population for some reason.
*  It's so bad.
*  I forget what the guy estimated, but there was a guy who analyzed all the people that
*  are alive today in Japan and how many of them would have grandchildren.
*  And it's a shockingly low number.
*  I wonder what's the reason though?
*  That's a good question.
*  Probably, I think they like video games.
*  You know, that's a problem with young people.
*  Bro, I love video games too, but I also love pussy.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  You can play a couple games, then later on at night get some ass.
*  I don't understand.
*  I think they're just locked in.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what's going on.
*  What I thought it was rejection.
*  People are so afraid of rejection over there.
*  Like a guy going and hitting on a girl and she rejects him.
*  He probably won't hit on that girl again for the next couple of months or years or something like that.
*  Oh really?
*  That is really bad, especially if she rejects him in front of other people.
*  Oh, so it's an honor thing?
*  Embarrassment thing?
*  Yeah, it's an embarrassment thing.
*  That's why I kind of think it is.
*  That's why I think it is.
*  Jamie, see if you can find something on Japan's dwindling population.
*  Because it is kind of crazy.
*  I got a couple of friends that's married out there.
*  One of my friends, we were just having a conversation.
*  His name is Tyson.
*  He's an African guy and he owns a bar out there.
*  I've been going to this bar for over 20 something years after all my fights.
*  I used to go into this bar and we got to know each other really well.
*  He was talking and he was saying,
*  If you love a Japanese woman and you marry a Japanese woman, do not give her a pet or kids.
*  Because if you give her a pet or kids, you're never fucking again.
*  What?
*  I was married to a Japanese woman.
*  I didn't have that problem.
*  Maybe it was just him.
*  No, that's what I thought.
*  And then he said, oh, you don't believe me?
*  And he asked the Japanese guys and a couple of other guys that were there, American guys that were married, they said yeah.
*  They all said the same story.
*  How weird.
*  This is in the AP four weeks ago about birthrate declining and population decline.
*  Says a survey show young Japanese are increasingly reluctant to marry or have children discouraged by bleak job prospects.
*  The high cost of living, which rises at a faster pace than salaries and a gender biased corporate structure or corporate culture that adds an extra burden only on women and working mothers.
*  Japan's population of more than one hundred twenty five million is projected to fall by about 30 percent to eighty seven million by twenty seven.
*  That's crazy.
*  With four out of every ten people, sixty five years of age or older.
*  Whoa, that's nuts.
*  Yeah, that's a big drop.
*  And that doesn't really give a reason why.
*  Falls to a record low.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, I heard they pant niggas to go to have baby.
*  They're they're encouraging people to go over there and buy houses to apparently it's really easy to buy a house and you can get a nice house for this fairly low money.
*  It's safe.
*  Yeah, it's cheap too.
*  Yeah, it's a beautiful culture.
*  I don't think I could ever live any place that doesn't crack jokes.
*  Yeah, I need fun.
*  Yeah, I'm too used to it.
*  I've had fun for too long.
*  But I tell you what, though, those yuccas are they funny though.
*  They like Americans.
*  Oh, I'm sure they not like the rest of them.
*  So you'd be hanging around much of those motherfuckers.
*  Yeah, but I don't want to fuck up.
*  I like my pinkies.
*  If you're not one of them, they wouldn't fuck with you like that.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, maybe I just hang out with them.
*  I remember one time I had a meeting with a big yucca boss.
*  This guy was the biggest Japanese guy I ever met.
*  He was like, he was like six six and he was like ripped like twice my size and very muscular.
*  And when I met him, it was right after I did that Arona slam and I got really popular in Japan.
*  What year was that?
*  2003?
*  That was actually 20 years ago.
*  Oh, wow.
*  20 years ago.
*  2004.
*  I did on my 26th birthday.
*  Dude, that is to this day the greatest slam in the history of this sport.
*  And a lesson for everybody that hangs onto a triangle when a dude's picking you up.
*  All you had to do was let go of my head.
*  All you had to do.
*  I couldn't have picked him up.
*  And other guys did that with you.
*  I forget who tried to get you in a triangle afterwards.
*  It was Vanellay.
*  He grabbed my leg after that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know, I did that to Sakuraba, but it didn't knock him out.
*  I slammed Sakuraba a couple of times.
*  It was from an ombar and stuff though.
*  Sakuraba was so tough.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I saw him a couple of weeks ago.
*  Here it is right here.
*  Bro, this is the absolute craziest because you threw him over the top of your head like a pillow.
*  I mean, it's the greatest, the greatest KO slam of all time.
*  I thought he was dead.
*  I remember watching it.
*  I was like, oh my God.
*  Wait, he didn't hold, he didn't hold the back of my head, did he?
*  No, he didn't hold shit.
*  Oh shit.
*  All these years I thought he was holding, okay, then he let it go.
*  He was punching.
*  No, as soon as you get that left hand involved, so he's punching you, you scoop under and
*  get that left hand involved.
*  He's holding on to something.
*  Look at this.
*  Boom.
*  When you connected your two hands like that and slammed down, holy shit.
*  Because you think about it, man.
*  You got your whole body like this and he's over the top of your head.
*  That's so much force.
*  Yeah.
*  That was maybe the hardest anybody's ever been hit in this sport.
*  Yeah, that was, yeah.
*  Because look at the amount of travel that he does.
*  Bro, you got him like 12 feet in the air.
*  Look at that.
*  And he goes straight and you were powerful as fuck back then.
*  And all the speed and force you're generating, oh my God.
*  And then you hit his head, head to head.
*  You guys collided heads.
*  Yeah, he head butted me.
*  A lot of people are saying I head butted him.
*  That's what knocked him out.
*  But he was already knocked out.
*  His head bounced off the canvas and hit me.
*  He's not going to stay conscious from that kind of slam.
*  That's the craziest slam ever.
*  He didn't fight much after that either, did he?
*  No.
*  You think he was embarrassed or what?
*  I think he was never the same.
*  I think when a guy gets knocked out like that, it's probably different than any head kick, any knee to the head, anything.
*  It's a car accident.
*  Bro, I felt bad because he was a great fighter.
*  He was.
*  He really was.
*  He was tough.
*  Very good jiu-jitsu, strong as hell.
*  I was losing that fight up until then because he was kicking the shit out of my leg.
*  I didn't want to check that.
*  I didn't want to check that his kicks were coming so hard.
*  I fought K-1 and I fought a lot of kickboxes, but his kicks are the hardest by far.
*  Wow, really?
*  Yeah.
*  Every time he kicked me, I was acting like it didn't hurt.
*  After the third kick, I remember thinking in my head, I don't know if I can keep acting like this shit don't hurt.
*  Because I didn't want to show him in my face.
*  Right.
*  But it got the hardest leg kicks I ever felt.
*  Have you seen that new stupid thing that they're doing like slap fight where they leg kick each other?
*  No, I haven't.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I haven't seen that shit.
*  This is a new one.
*  Have you seen it, Jamie?
*  I could send it to you if you want me to.
*  I sent it to Dana.
*  It's, yeah, they're having slap fight competitions, but leg kicks.
*  These dudes are standing in front of each other just teeing off leg kicks.
*  That's dangerous.
*  Oh, it's horrible.
*  Man, yeah, that can-
*  Did you find it, Jamie?
*  I'll send it to you.
*  Here you go.
*  That can fuck you up real bad.
*  Oh, it's rough.
*  It's rough to watch.
*  And some guys are kicking like right- you're supposed to kick the thigh, but some guys are kicking really kind of like right above the knee and buckling.
*  And you just stand there.
*  You can't even move.
*  You have to just eat it.
*  I wouldn't.
*  That's not my shit.
*  How do you feel about that slap fight?
*  I don't- I'm fully in support of anybody doing whatever the fuck they want to do.
*  I'm like, if you could bull ride, if you could BMX jump and skateboard and all that crazy shit where people are breaking their necks, here it is.
*  They're standing in front of each other.
*  I feel like you should be able to do anything, but I wouldn't do it.
*  Oh.
*  Because getting hit is- it should be rare and you should avoid it.
*  Look, dude kicked him in the leg, then grabbed the top of his head.
*  I would have smacked him just for that.
*  I think they're friends.
*  Oh.
*  It's like, sorry, bro.
*  You know?
*  That dude tapped out.
*  The last one he tapped out.
*  They got a bunch of them in there.
*  Oh, no, I didn't even hear that.
*  They're just standing in front of each other and slamming each other in the knee.
*  Or slamming each other in the thigh.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a good time for MMA and all this shit.
*  I saw the Karate comeback with Boss Ruin.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's entertaining.
*  Did you see the guy get that scissor kick?
*  Yes.
*  Rafael the Turner.
*  That guy's badass, man.
*  And he fought James Vick.
*  James Vick's been KO'd a bunch of times now.
*  It's like he might not want to do this anymore because that was a bad one.
*  That switch kick.
*  Yeah, he was out for a while, it looked like.
*  It was horrible.
*  Perfect kick, though.
*  Did you see that, Jamie?
*  I'll send you that.
*  That shit was incredible.
*  I mean, I'd always wondered when someone was going to pull that one off in a fight.
*  Like, kick to the leg and then up kick right afterwards.
*  Man, he did that shit perfect.
*  Oh, it's flawless.
*  Here's the fight.
*  The KO is so nasty.
*  The Karate combat, the whole, that guy Rafael the Turner.
*  There it is right before that.
*  Watch this switch.
*  It's so crazy the way he does it, the way he sets it up.
*  He right kicks.
*  Boom.
*  I mean, perfect.
*  Perfect.
*  Yeah, that was crazy knockout.
*  Crazy.
*  That guy's super athletic.
*  I never heard of either of those guys.
*  He used to fight in the UFC.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  I don't know why he's not in the UFC anymore, but man.
*  He should go back now?
*  They're going to test him.
*  They're going to test him.
*  I don't know why he left the UFC.
*  I don't know if he had an issue.
*  I'm not sure.
*  Good fighter though.
*  But man, that's crazy.
*  It's interesting we watch in an organization that tests versus don't test too right?
*  Yeah.
*  How do you feel about that?
*  I have two thoughts.
*  One, I like to see older athletes compete.
*  And if you get a guy who's like 35, 36 years old, if you let him juice, if you let him use testosterone, if you just do it sensibly, not crazy, but if he can go to a doctor, make sure it's only administered by a doctor so they're not self-administering, and make sure they test them to make sure they're not above a certain level, I don't have any problem with that.
*  But when you get guys like what Vitor did, Vitor just fill them up, doc.
*  He blew the fuck up.
*  He just like take it to my eyeballs.
*  Just fucking, and man, when he was TRTV tour to fans when they talk about it like that was an error.
*  When that era when he was on a tear, when he knocked out Luke Rockhold and knocked out Bisping, and he was fucking everybody up, dude.
*  He was fearless.
*  But he was also like heavily enhanced.
*  You know, was not a normal human being.
*  I remember the time when it was when it was legal.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And they fucked it up because I tried this shit after I got beat by John Jones.
*  I was like, fuck, I must be getting old.
*  And I tried it and it helped me out a little bit.
*  Then they outlawed us.
*  I said, fuck, I guess I'm back to the old me.
*  Yeah, they outlawed it.
*  There was a lot of guys on it and a lot of guys were abusing it.
*  Some guys like some guys got pulled from fights because they test them the day of and like there's no fucking way you are so high.
*  This is crazy.
*  Nate Marquardt, they actually stopped the fight.
*  They stopped it from happening.
*  Yeah, they canceled the fight.
*  Yeah, you know, pride.
*  They never tested.
*  They will.
*  Ensign Inouye told me that they had in capital letters.
*  We do not test for steroids in the contract.
*  Yeah, but that test you for like weed and cocaine and all that shit.
*  That's hilarious.
*  But they wouldn't take you for steroids.
*  So they tested you.
*  They just didn't test you for anything that would actually help you fight.
*  It seems like they kind of encouraged it.
*  Oh, yeah, they definitely encouraged it.
*  Yeah, they did with a guy I know.
*  He went over there and he was, you know, about he wanted to fight at 170.
*  I was like, no, you fight at 185.
*  And they're like, we give you steroids.
*  Everybody thought I was on steroids when I was fighting over there.
*  Well, you just had great genetics.
*  You know, some people have great genetics and some people need steroids.
*  Yeah, I always tell people, look at me and look at some of the other fighters.
*  You can look at my body and tell that wasn't on this shit.
*  Well, the difference is when they get tested, like when the pre-USADA and post-USADA days are so interesting,
*  because even though they outlawed testosterone, still guys like Overeem,
*  there's not a chance in hell that guy was natural.
*  He was not natural at all.
*  There's no way, no way, especially when he fought Brock Lesnar.
*  But somehow or another he passed the test.
*  But the test, the day of, like the day of like the Wayans test, that's nonsense.
*  That is nonsense.
*  Like all the benefits are still there and all the stuff is out of your system.
*  Bro, it's crazy.
*  I used to fight over there with Alistair Wright and he was like the bony 205er.
*  Yeah, he was thin.
*  He was thin.
*  Then one day I saw him like, God damn, what the fuck you doing?
*  He's at horse meat.
*  I'm like, okay, buddy.
*  Yeah, he was powerlifting.
*  You remember when he got up to like 265, you know, when he won the K-1 Grand Prix?
*  I mean, you couldn't hit him.
*  He was a mountain.
*  He was just covered behind muscle.
*  And you know, K-1 style, when they fight with like the earmuffs on, when they're standing there, like he was just, there was no chin.
*  You couldn't see it in there.
*  He was a bad muffle.
*  He won it too, didn't he?
*  Yeah, he won the Grand Prix, which is crazy.
*  He was a bad, I was always worried I was going to have to fight him in pride.
*  But I don't know why they never put me against him.
*  Bro, when he fought Brock Lesnar, if they kept the testing that way, he might have been the heavyweight champion.
*  He might have stayed the heavyweight champion too.
*  I mean, he was hard to handle that way.
*  He was so big.
*  He was so big.
*  And he had those elite kickboxing skills.
*  You know, I remember when he fought, I guess it was Strikeforce, when he fought Bret Rogers.
*  You can see the moment he hits Bret Rogers with one low kick and you can see it in Bret Rogers face like, oh shit, like this is different.
*  This is so different.
*  He was so scary, man.
*  Yeah, fuck.
*  Big, tall motherfucker.
*  I would like to see him go against John Jones.
*  I would have loved to see that back in the day.
*  But if again, you let him fight enhanced, because the difference between him enhanced and unenhanced, he became an average fighter.
*  Yeah, but John was enhanced too though.
*  If they would have went against each other, both enhanced.
*  At the time.
*  At the time.
*  So you think John was enhanced?
*  Yeah, I think it's proven.
*  Really? Because of the whole thing with the picograms, whatever the fuck that shit is?
*  Well, you know, I don't pay a whole lot of attention to it, but I just thought he got popped, so I assumed that he was enhanced.
*  He did, but the problem that he got popped with, there were so minuscule levels that it didn't make sense.
*  He don't look like somebody.
*  He does steroids.
*  No, he doesn't.
*  But neither did Lance Armstrong.
*  He probably doing something different though, Lance.
*  No, he was doing testosterone.
*  I mean, he was definitely doing that too.
*  Those guys were doing, he was doing a lot of shit.
*  They do everything they can when they do that tour de France.
*  Doctors say that it's actually healthier to do that thing on steroids than it is to not be on steroids because your body just can't recover.
*  Because you're biking for hours and hours and hours, day after day.
*  It's a fucking crazy event.
*  I think if you biking and doing shit like that, let them do steroids.
*  But fighting, I'm against that shit.
*  It's different.
*  Yeah, football, boxing, MMA, shit like that.
*  But football, you know they're doing something.
*  Yeah, you know they're doing it.
*  Those guys are gigantic.
*  Yeah, but I think if you got full contact against another human, I think it should be outlawed.
*  But baseball, I wouldn't give a fuck.
*  It would only make it interesting.
*  And basketball, I wouldn't care.
*  Right, who cares?
*  Who cares?
*  Especially the professional athletes.
*  They have a small window of opportunity.
*  They have like 10, 15 years at most where they can compete at their very best.
*  Yeah, let those guys juice.
*  Juice them up.
*  Yeah, let them do it, help them out how to do it safely.
*  But fighting, because you can hurt somebody.
*  Because some people are totally against it.
*  Well, the only way it makes sense in fighting is if everybody agrees.
*  You know, like if you agree.
*  But if you're cheating, you know, if you're just jobbing the tests and you know you got a good scientist that works with you and you're figuring out a way to rig everything.
*  No, that's not good.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I'm against it because I fought a few guys that was on steroids and I was fighting in pride.
*  Who did you fight that was like the most obvious on steroids?
*  For me, I felt like it was the most obvious was Kevin Randemann, RIP.
*  I don't ever want to talk ill of Big Bro, but Mark Coleman, he's honest about it.
*  Yeah.
*  They were doing something.
*  And Vanellay for sure was on that shit.
*  For sure.
*  For sure.
*  For sure.
*  For sure.
*  Bro, he fought like he was on it.
*  Oh my God.
*  He fought like he had rabies.
*  Bro, that guy was so vicious.
*  He just walked around mad the whole time.
*  You know, all the fighters in Japan was scared of him.
*  That's why he didn't like me because I was never afraid of him.
*  The first time I had to run in with Vanellay, we were all staying in the same hotel and I'm walking back from press and I get on an elevator with my corner man and the elevator opens up and there's Vanellay in there with two of his corner men.
*  And I just, I don't notice him.
*  I just walk on the elevator and I turn around and my two corner men took off.
*  So I'm in the elevator by myself with Vanellay and he looked at me like I was crazy because I didn't take off with them.
*  He seemed like he was mad that I was breathing his same air in the elevator.
*  He was like, what are you doing?
*  And they was talking shit in Portuguese and stuff like that.
*  I was like, I ain't afraid of no motherfucking body.
*  I was a kid then too, but I just never been afraid of anybody.
*  Then after I meet my two corner men, what the fuck happened?
*  Why the fuck y'all go?
*  I was like, shit, that was Dax murder.
*  I'm not getting nervous.
*  You sleep?
*  I said, so you just little lit?
*  Not you.
*  They didn't even pull you out.
*  They didn't even touch me.
*  Oh, that's so ridiculous.
*  I would have never trusted those dudes again.
*  Yeah, fuck them.
*  I was cool, but he never liked me.
*  Were you there when he had that fight with Charles Crazy Horse Bennett in the back room?
*  No, I wasn't there.
*  Apparently the story is Crazy Horse knocked him out cold.
*  Yeah, I heard that.
*  That's the story is.
*  The story is they ganged up on Crazy Horse.
*  Crazy Horse was a wild dude.
*  That dude was crazy.
*  He was fun.
*  I remember I got drunk with Crazy Horse one night.
*  Me and I think it was Eddie Bravo went to see Brock Lesnar's first professional fight in LA at the Coliseum.
*  Was it with UFC?
*  No, no, I think it was with K-1.
*  I think it was a K-1 fight in Los Angeles.
*  I might have been there.
*  Hoist Gracie fought that night.
*  I think Hoist Gracie fought Sargaraba, if I remember correctly.
*  Was that a rematch?
*  Yes.
*  I wasn't there.
*  I don't think I was there.
*  He beat him and Hoist was a little saucy.
*  He got caught.
*  Hoist beat Sargaraba in the rematch?
*  Yeah, but Hoist was saucy.
*  They caught him in the piss test.
*  If I remember correctly, check to see if that's true, but I sat right next to Crazy Horse.
*  Just me and him got fucked up the entire show.
*  That guy's crazy.
*  He's funny, man.
*  We had a lot of laughs, but he was a wild dude.
*  You know what he's doing now?
*  What's he doing now?
*  He's in Thailand fighting for fight circus.
*  You heard about them?
*  No.
*  He's fighting two motherfuckers at the same time, two Thai dudes at the same time.
*  I said, man, that shit look fun.
*  I want to do that shit.
*  How big are the Thai dudes?
*  They're his size.
*  He's fighting two on one?
*  Two on one in Thailand.
*  Does it just pay a lot of money or something?
*  I don't know how much they pay.
*  I did a two-headed boxing match with Bob Sapp after that.
*  I didn't get paid much money, but I was doing it for fun.
*  So you and him versus somebody else?
*  Yeah, me and Bob Sapp in a two-man t-shirt.
*  He's going to use my right hand.
*  He's going to use his left hand.
*  That shit was so fun.
*  That's crazy.
*  That was the most fun I ever had in a ring, bro.
*  Just ridiculous?
*  Yeah, it was fun.
*  Fight circus is crazy.
*  What does this say, Jim?
*  Oh yeah, he tested positive for fighter Tim Percy, tested positive for methamphetamines.
*  That's my friend.
*  And Hoyce Gracie tested positive for nandrolone.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  And a box-tower.
*  Tim Percy is my college wrestling roommate in college.
*  No shit.
*  Tim Percy?
*  Who did he fight?
*  Who else was in that card?
*  Let me see.
*  There was some...
*  What the fuck?
*  Who else fucked?
*  The original, let's see, pre-fight problem.
*  Scroll back up to the card again, please.
*  Let me see who was on that card.
*  Because there was one crazy KO where there was like a football player.
*  Johnny Morton, right?
*  He fought a guy who was a comedian.
*  That guy.
*  Bernard Akkak.
*  How do you say his name?
*  Akka?
*  A Japanese-born taekwondo practitioner, kickboxer, mixed martial arts, and comedian.
*  Yeah, that guy.
*  Fuck Johnny Morton up.
*  It was horrible.
*  The comedian fucked somebody up?
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I don't know how good his comedy is, but he can fuck people up.
*  I'll tell you that.
*  Jake Shields was on that card.
*  He won by rear-naked choke.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, Sakuraba was on there.
*  Yep.
*  So Hoyce beat Sakuraba, but then tested positive.
*  This was supposed to be on the card.
*  Ray Sefo and Marvin Eastwood dropped from the card with no explanation given.
*  That was supposed to be on the card.
*  Gina Carano.
*  Oh, Gina Carano.
*  So that was a K-1, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That was like up until Brock Lesnar won real quick.
*  That was his first fight ever.
*  Yeah.
*  So Crazy Horse was backstage, and I guess all the shoot-the-box guys got into it with
*  Crazy Horse.
*  And didn't Christian Marcelo, I think he choked Crazy Horse out.
*  With a triangle.
*  Put him in a triangle afterwards too.
*  Yeah, I heard this story.
*  So Crazy Horse apparently knocked out Van Der Le and then got choked out, and then he
*  went and fought, or had he already fought?
*  I don't remember, but I heard Van Der Le fought after he got knocked out.
*  He did.
*  After he got out cold, fought, and won.
*  But won by decision.
*  Who did he fight that time, you remember?
*  Let's find out.
*  Let me see Van Der Le's record.
*  I'll tell you when I see it.
*  Because you could tell he was fighting a little cautious.
*  Maybe didn't want to get hit.
*  Bro, that's crazy.
*  What if they had cameras back there in the locker rooms?
*  I think there is video footage of it.
*  I'm pretty sure there's footage.
*  There's definitely footage of Marcelo choking out Crazy Horse because he gets him in a triangle
*  with his jeans on.
*  I remember watching it.
*  It's like 07, right?
*  Is that what you're looking?
*  Yeah.
*  It wasn't Mirko Krokop.
*  I think it might have been Fujita.
*  Nope, that's not it because he won that one by soccer kicks.
*  Does he have any that he won by decision?
*  Right here?
*  Maybe he lost to Arona.
*  Is that possible?
*  Maybe you should look for the same card with Crazy Horse.
*  He lost to Arona and then he beat him.
*  Decision split.
*  I wonder if it's that one.
*  2005.
*  I wonder if it's that one.
*  Click on Pride Shockwave 2005.
*  Let's see.
*  Who else is on that card?
*  Is Crazy Horse on that card?
*  Charles Bennett?
*  Yeah.
*  Way up.
*  Yep.
*  That's it.
*  That's the one.
*  That's the one.
*  He fought Arona and he won a decision.
*  Yeah, I was looking for video.
*  I remember why.
*  Crazy Horse is so nuts.
*  Look at that video of Crazy Horse staring at the camera.
*  Click on that.
*  Is that a highlight of Crazy Horse?
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy Horse had power.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he just put people to sleep.
*  He put a lot of people to sleep.
*  Compact power too.
*  Yeah.
*  He never went to the UFC though, huh?
*  Nope.
*  He couldn't get his shit together.
*  He's a wild fella.
*  What the fuck is wrong with him?
*  I mean, he fought with gold teeth in.
*  He fought with a gold grill in and then he had a mouthpiece on top that was gold too.
*  But I don't even know where he trained.
*  I forgot where he was from.
*  Texas or somewhere, was it?
*  I don't remember, but I mean, it did not have the ultimate skill set.
*  He just had crazy power and he was just wild.
*  Very wild.
*  He was strong.
*  And strong.
*  Yeah.
*  Very strong.
*  He didn't have that much jujitsu though, huh?
*  No, it wasn't that good on the ground, but on the feet.
*  I mean, I don't think he ever submitted to anybody that I can remember, but he fucked a lot of people up, man.
*  Anybody that stood in front of that dude went night night.
*  And you could see it.
*  Once he hit him like one time, the difference in the power, they'd be like, oh God.
*  It's crazy.
*  Power like that is really crazy.
*  Some people just have, like, did you watch the light heavyweight title fight this weekend?
*  Oh my God, yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  Bulleton, man.
*  Alex Barrera.
*  That fucking power is nuts.
*  You know what?
*  I was thinking, like, how would I would have done if I was in my prime fighting somebody like that?
*  You can be honest.
*  You have very good wrestling skills.
*  The difference is you're very strong.
*  You are always a very strong light heavyweight and you had very good wrestling skills.
*  You know, he hasn't really fought anybody that's an elite wrestler yet.
*  You know, I mean, think about who has he fought that could really wrestle.
*  Prochaska is like he's he's got crazy KO power.
*  He's got good karate skills.
*  And he did win by choking out Glover.
*  He did win with a choke.
*  So it's not like he doesn't have skills, but he's not, you know, he's not some Daniel Cormier type dude.
*  He's just an elite wrestler.
*  I'm thinking.
*  Is this the video footage of the fight?
*  It cuts off on the fight.
*  So it's got to exist somewhere else.
*  But this is a documentary about Crazy Horse.
*  But is it?
*  Is that the behind the scenes?
*  It shows like a picture of them on the says can't show the footage as YouTube restrict the footage.
*  What YouTube restricts fights?
*  It could age restrict the video and they're probably trying not to have that.
*  Oh, so they're just showing it.
*  So he catches them in a triangle with jeans on chokes him to sleep out cold with his phone in his hand.
*  What is that?
*  That's the past.
*  So it wakes him up.
*  He's like, oh, shit.
*  They shouldn't have had him in that locker room with them anyway.
*  No chance.
*  Yeah, that's a terrible idea.
*  And there's Vandalia.
*  He's talking about it.
*  Yeah, I'm talking about it.
*  He said Vandalia says he just turned to hit me.
*  He's trying to say you got sucker punch.
*  Probably did.
*  But also they're probably talking a lot of shit and they probably thought they could keep talking shit before getting hit and Crazy Horse.
*  What was his corner man?
*  Well, who was with them?
*  I think they just thought they'd get away with it.
*  You know, they probably didn't think he was going to swing on them, especially since Charles was.
*  He was light.
*  What did he fight at?
*  Probably 55.
*  Probably something like that.
*  Something like that.
*  And Vandalia was a big 200.
*  Yeah, 205.
*  He was a big 205.
*  Yeah.
*  But I was talking about maybe like when I the era, the rampage when I fought Chuck Liddell, I probably wouldn't have tried to take Alex down.
*  I probably would have still with him.
*  I probably would have tried until he until he started fucking me up down like, oh, shit.
*  Then it's time to take him down.
*  Did you ever fight anybody who calf kicked you?
*  Yeah, Forrest.
*  Forrest Griffin did?
*  Forrest Griffin did.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  The first interesting the first two rounds.
*  The first I think the first the first round.
*  So he fucked my calf up.
*  I've never seen that kick before.
*  Really?
*  Interesting.
*  Never even trained trained against it because that was 2008.
*  Interesting.
*  My worst year ever.
*  Yeah.
*  He calf kicked the shit out of me.
*  I was like, what the fuck?
*  What the fuck is this?
*  This shit was hurting.
*  Yeah, it's no one does it like Alex Pereira does.
*  He does it so sneaky.
*  It's also he's got that crazy long frame, you know, but he stands almost like square and then just throws the leg out like you don't even see anything coming.
*  There's no no tell at all.
*  There's no like dip.
*  There's no step.
*  It's just throws it out there and all sudden.
*  Oh, you see guys legs get fucked up one or two of them and you can't move good.
*  And that guy he just came out of nowhere just fucking people up.
*  Well, I knew about him before because I watched kickboxing and I'd seen him in kickboxing.
*  I was like, this guy comes in MMA.
*  Everybody's fucked because he was fucking everybody up with big gloves on.
*  He would hit dudes.
*  You could see that it was just like they had never been hit like that before.
*  He would like I remember the first time I saw him fought.
*  He KO'd Dustin Jacoby and he hit him with a left hook that just spun his head around.
*  I was like, oh my God.
*  Yeah, I heard he had a crazy that book.
*  That's his that's his main weapon.
*  Like if you thought about one weapon that he knocks everybody out with, I mean, that's the one he mocked.
*  Knocked Jamal Hill out with the first fight with or the first knockdown with Yuri the first fight with Yuri.
*  He knocked him out with the left hook.
*  They got did he get out of Sonia?
*  He got him with a left hook.
*  Yeah, he gets everybody with that left hook.
*  Yeah, but he's got it's not like that's the only weapon he had anything he hits you with your fuck.
*  But if you know, he got a big left hook.
*  How come you don't train to just keep your hand up?
*  So you just look out for it like that's what boxers do.
*  I don't understand.
*  He throws a nasty jab to the body too.
*  That's one of the things he did with Yuri.
*  He throws his jab to the body and it sounded like a right hand.
*  So, blap blap.
*  It's like this fight he fought different than he fought the first fight.
*  I think the first fight he let Yuri get a little wild.
*  And then he's like trying to find his openings.
*  And this fight he was like, I'm going to shut all that wild shit down.
*  There's a short notice fight for them to one.
*  Yeah, a couple of weeks.
*  Just a couple of weeks.
*  Just a couple of weeks.
*  I think Yuri got three weeks.
*  And Alex when he found out about the fight, I believe he was in Australia doing seminars.
*  And they said, hey, do you want to defend your light heavyweight title International Fight Week in three weeks?
*  He's like, let me think about this for a little bit.
*  So there's the left hook.
*  Let's see this.
*  Boom.
*  Fade away left hook.
*  It's just got a lot of power on that hook.
*  It's crazy power.
*  He's a big guy too, huh?
*  He's huge.
*  And there's the head kick.
*  They should have stopped that fight the moment he went down.
*  They shouldn't have let him eat all those extra shots.
*  I mean, he was done.
*  I think Herb wanted to give him a chance because the first fight got stopped a little premature.
*  The thing about that guy is you can't let that guy hurt you because he'll hit you one more time.
*  And if he hits you one more time, you're gone.
*  Yeah, but you know, sometimes you just be calling the moment.
*  Like people give me shit for hitting ventilate like three more times when I knocked them out.
*  UFC.
*  Sometimes you just get caught in a moment.
*  Yeah, you don't even know what's happening.
*  Yeah, you don't know.
*  Also, that guy, you had history with that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, you wanted to get that back.
*  He deserved it, but I know I shouldn't have did it.
*  If I would have been in my right mind, I wouldn't have gave him.
*  Because it's much cooler to have a walk off knockout, you know?
*  Right.
*  But I wouldn't have gave him those extra.
*  But the day before he pushed me at the weigh-ins.
*  Yeah.
*  And he talked shit to me.
*  And you know how they didn't have that rules meeting or whatever?
*  He was talking shit to me.
*  Like I was scared of him.
*  I was like, bro, come on.
*  I was like, I was in the zone.
*  I guess he felt like because he had beaten you twice that it was going to be, you know, you were in his head.
*  Not only did he beat me, he gave me two of the worst ass whoopings I ever had in my career.
*  And so he probably thought that was in the back of my head.
*  But I think most times people get like that, you know?
*  They get where, oh, this guy got my number, blah, blah, blah.
*  I didn't have any of those feelings.
*  I just knew, I always knew I could beat him.
*  But the first two times I fought him, I think the first time I fought him, I had fought Chuck Liddell 45 minutes before.
*  And then the second time I went through this crazy religious thing where I got born again.
*  First day of training camp.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  What happened there?
*  Craziest thing in my life.
*  It's the craziest thing that ever happened to me.
*  You know, back then I was a single parent.
*  I had got custody of my son.
*  He was three years old and just overnight I was a dad.
*  And I'm trying to fight in Japan and everything.
*  And after that, after that, I ran a fight.
*  And like I was saying, I had got real famous in Japan.
*  And then I was going out partying a lot and drinking.
*  And I never became an alcoholic.
*  You know, I don't like alcoholics and stuff like that because my dad used to be one.
*  I always drink socially, but then I started craving alcohol.
*  So long story short, I think one thing led to another.
*  And one day I just had this crazy dream.
*  And I was at home and it seemed like it was a devil in my chest with his hands like this.
*  I'll never forget having his hands in my chest.
*  And it had some female spirits around and he was saying, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
*  And I was just laying there in my dream and I heard a voice say, do you know this man?
*  I was like, no.
*  And he said, well, you're not okay.
*  What is not okay?
*  I said, oh.
*  And I jumped up and I went to go, I was scared as fuck.
*  I'm a big bad motherfucker fucking people up.
*  And I was scared.
*  And I went to go wake my son up.
*  And he said he was dreaming.
*  He wouldn't tell me his dream because he didn't like me that much because I just got custody of him.
*  I'm being the father figure, making him eat healthy and telling him knowing stuff a lot.
*  He wouldn't tell me a whole lot.
*  But he said he was dreaming.
*  So my friend finally got out of him.
*  He said when my dad woke me up, God and the devil was fighting and God hit the devil with the sword.
*  And when I woke him up, he just did like this, just purged a lot of white pus out his mouth.
*  What?
*  Yeah, crazy.
*  True story.
*  So I take him.
*  That's not even the scary part.
*  That wasn't what scared me.
*  What scared me was I took him to preschool and I got back in my car and I must have the radio on.
*  And as soon as I turned the radio on, it was a commercial on.
*  I didn't know at the time what commercial it was.
*  But it said the curse of such and such, your soul is mine.
*  That scared the shit out of me.
*  I turned the radio off for six weeks.
*  Six weeks.
*  I found out later it was a fucking commercial for Revenge of the Mummy Ride and fucking Six Flags.
*  That shit scared me straight.
*  He thought it was the devil talking to you.
*  Oh my God.
*  Scared me straight, bro.
*  Wow.
*  And then that night I couldn't sleep.
*  Me and my son, we went to go sleep over at one of my friend's house.
*  And this is what brought me to being born again, what Christians say.
*  I had to piss.
*  And I was over at my friend's house.
*  It was really dark.
*  I told you I was scared.
*  I couldn't sleep in my room.
*  Me and my son sleep on the floor in my friend's room and I had to take a piss.
*  And my son was wetting the bed and he was lying a lot.
*  I'm trying to teach him not to lie and teach him not to wet the bed.
*  And I was wetting the bed and blaming on him because I was too scared to go to the bathroom.
*  You were too scared to go to the bathroom.
*  That's so nuts.
*  And what I did, I prayed to God because my dad had just got saved like two years before.
*  He said he was praying for me.
*  And I remember what my dad said.
*  He said, oh, when you pray to God, just say in Jesus' name.
*  So I was like, God, I'm a coward right now.
*  Just take this fear from my heart.
*  In Jesus' name, I love you.
*  Amen.
*  And within two minutes, I was laughing and crying at the same time.
*  And I received the Holy Ghost Spirit.
*  And I wasn't afraid.
*  I went to use the restroom.
*  My eyes were different.
*  Everything was different.
*  That's the first day of training camp for Vanellay, the second fight.
*  And then so I'm training for Vanellay.
*  My coach thought I was crazy.
*  He brought a preacher in.
*  He thought I lost my mind.
*  I was crazy because I'm totally you know how I was back then.
*  I'm saying a whole bunch of crazy shit, doing a whole bunch of crazy shit.
*  And again, I didn't cuss anymore.
*  It just changed me right away.
*  And then my coach found out I wasn't crazy.
*  But it was the start of our relationship going south.
*  And I started training for Vanellay.
*  Then I got closer to fight.
*  And I was like, I'm going to kill this motherfucker.
*  I'm going to kill him.
*  And I'm thinking in my mind, I'm Christian now.
*  I can't be thinking like that.
*  It's the most confusing part of my life.
*  And so I fasted like an idiot.
*  I fasted for like three or four days because I read in the Bible, you fast, you get closer to God and all that stuff.
*  And it's true. I got closer to God, but it wasn't a good idea to fast before a fucking championship fight.
*  And I went out there.
*  How many days out from the fight were you fasting?
*  Well, so I got to Japan that I think that Tuesday and the fight was that Sunday.
*  So I think I broke my fast.
*  So I think it was like four days before the fight when I ended my fast.
*  But I think I fasted for three or four days.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  I never did that shit again.
*  And you were training while you were fasting?
*  Yeah.
*  How bad was that?
*  Bro, I was in another place.
*  It was the weirdest thing.
*  I didn't have to cut weight.
*  That's my first time.
*  I had to cut weight for my fight.
*  Wow.
*  I thought that was a good thing.
*  But I thought I was doing good.
*  I was winning the fight.
*  Then I got knocked the fuck out.
*  And I tried to cop it up to me faster.
*  That's my excuse, I think.
*  Well, it certainly would have drained your body to not eat for three days.
*  I mean, if you're going for a performance, they say it's healthy for your body every now and then
*  to take a few days off and not consume any food.
*  But not before a fight.
*  Not before a fight, yeah.
*  I mean, I wouldn't even say before camp.
*  I would say make it like you're out.
*  You got time.
*  Yeah.
*  I've been trying to fast now for health reasons.
*  And I can't even get past two days now.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah.
*  Can't do it.
*  Do you eat a lot of carbohydrates?
*  No.
*  I cut that shit out.
*  Yeah?
*  Remember, I got super fat.
*  Especially my last fight with Fador.
*  My God.
*  Yeah.
*  I got super fat.
*  I got mixed diagnosed with what?
*  Hypothyroid.
*  And they had me on this fucking medicine and shit.
*  And that shit fucked me up.
*  And I started training with this crazy social media guy named Sean Rez.
*  He's been my friend for years.
*  I met him from one of my other friends.
*  And I used to always see him.
*  We used to go out and kick it and party and stuff like that.
*  Go out drinking.
*  And we end up at his house with girls and stuff and hang out.
*  And he was always ripped like a Persian guy.
*  But he looked like a fucking Viking, right?
*  So one day I asked the guy, like, man, how in the fuck you stay ripped like that all year round?
*  And he told me, he said, man, this is what I do.
*  I said, you on that shit.
*  And he said, no, I ain't on shit.
*  And he said, I do two hours of cardio.
*  He works out like two or three times a day.
*  And he don't eat carbs.
*  How often?
*  Jesus Christ.
*  That's my trainer.
*  That's my coach.
*  He changed my fucking life, bro.
*  Damn.
*  That dude looks good.
*  I lost 30 pounds training with him.
*  And so he does two hours of cardio.
*  How often a week?
*  This motherfucker training like six, seven days a week.
*  So he does two hours of cardio every day?
*  Well, now I think he dropped it down to an hour now.
*  But when I asked him, he was doing two hours of Stereomaster.
*  And so I did it with him, right?
*  This motherfucker is on like level 13.
*  I'm over there on level four, like fucking dying.
*  He's on level 13 for like fucking hours straight.
*  Damn.
*  He's the strongest man I ever fucking met.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, he changed my life.
*  And he don't take no shit.
*  You know how I be trying to get out of shit?
*  I'm like, no, you meet me at the gym at this motherfucker time?
*  He don't give a fuck.
*  But he changed my life and changed my diet.
*  So now I just, I don't know if it's like a carnivore diet, but I eat vegetables and stuff.
*  But I mostly eat steak every day and sweet potatoes.
*  Yeah, so like more of like, what would they call that?
*  Paleo diet?
*  Yeah.
*  I just eat what he tell me to eat.
*  I think there's a lot of people that feel like the real problem that people have is with grains.
*  Grains, carbohydrates that come from bread, pasta, that kind of shit, rice.
*  Yeah.
*  And then if you can cut all that out and just eat meat and vegetables, you'll be way better off.
*  Bro, I've learned by traveling where I went to Columbia to get stem cells.
*  And I stayed there for like eight days and I lose weight and I eat whatever the fuck I want.
*  And I lose weight there.
*  I could eat pasta, bread, whatever there.
*  And I lost like 15 pounds in eight days over there, over there getting bioaccelerator.
*  Yeah.
*  Getting stem cells.
*  I first thought it was the stem cells.
*  But one time I went there and I just went to hang out.
*  I didn't get stem cells.
*  Still lost 15 pounds.
*  The food, American food is bad, bro.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Just filled with preservatives and bullshit and seed oils and corn syrup and just shit.
*  Why?
*  Why they doing this like that, man?
*  Because they make money.
*  They don't give a fuck.
*  It's the same thing as why they over prescribe medications.
*  Same thing why they send us off to war.
*  They don't give a fuck.
*  When you allow people to make as much money as they possibly can, they do almost every time,
*  especially Americans, almost every time they sacrifice people for money.
*  Yeah, I figured that's what it is.
*  I'll boil down the money.
*  But there's other ways to make money off us.
*  Yeah, but they started this shit in the 1960s, man.
*  They bribed sugar scientists.
*  It was the 60s, right?
*  Wasn't it when they did that?
*  I think it was the 50s.
*  50s?
*  They bribed sugar scientists.
*  They bribed scientists, rather, to say that sugar is good for you and saturated fats are bad for you.
*  They tried to say that all these people having heart attacks and all the cardiovascular issues that people have,
*  that this is actually because of saturated fat, which is just not true.
*  You're right.
*  1960s.
*  1960s.
*  The sugar industry paid scientists to downplay the link between sugar and heart disease and instead promote saturated fat as the culprit.
*  Sugar Research Foundation, now known as the Sugar Association, funded the research that reviewed the scientific literature and set the reviews objective.
*  Sugar Research Foundation also provided materials for review and examined drafts before publication.
*  Yeah, it was all bullshit.
*  And fat is good for you.
*  Fat is healthy for you, especially saturated fat.
*  What?
*  What are you saying?
*  Yeah, fat from meat is really good for you.
*  Makes sense.
*  Yeah, of course it makes sense.
*  It's what human beings have been eating forever.
*  It's what most indigenous tribes, that's what they try to get.
*  They try to get fat, try to get meat and fat.
*  That's why people like Inuits, before American food started, American food and alcohol and cigarettes started making its way to like the Inuit tribes.
*  They have very low instances of heart disease and they eat nothing but fat.
*  They're eating fat all the time.
*  They're eating whale blubber and all kinds of shit like that and seal.
*  It seems like it's just more natural.
*  That's what's normal.
*  It's food.
*  It's real food.
*  That's the stuff that you're for.
*  Like when people say that margarine is good for you, margarine is fucking terrible for you.
*  I can't believe it's not butter.
*  Bitch, I can believe it.
*  It doesn't taste anything like butter.
*  It doesn't taste like it's like got a buttery texture.
*  It's fucking terrible.
*  It's a big tub of seed oil.
*  That shit's awful for you.
*  There's also like there's a lot of people that try to link the consumption of seed oils and margarine and shit like that to Alzheimer's.
*  That's when people started getting Alzheimer's disease.
*  They started using that stuff instead of butter and margarine or butter and fat.
*  I remember hearing that it was from deodorant antiperspirant.
*  That's not true.
*  That's got to be bad for you too.
*  That scared me because I don't want to be funky though, but then I don't want to be like mindless.
*  You can use, there's deodorants that don't have aluminum in it.
*  I take, I use a Toms of Maine deodorant, but there's a bunch of other ones.
*  There's another one that I use.
*  Native, natives real good.
*  I'll use that, but I use, I use deodorant.
*  I tried it because my son, my son is a hippie and he tried to get me in all this shit and I tried it.
*  You have a hippie person?
*  That's right.
*  Yeah. My son, Roger, he's the one that was fighting.
*  He's a fucking hippie, bro.
*  In what way?
*  Shit, this is like hippies, bro.
*  All natural stuff.
*  He's like, he's gonna feel like mushrooms.
*  Mushrooms are good for you.
*  Well.
*  Talk to Rashad about that.
*  I know I did.
*  Rashad is one of the most knowledgeable people I've ever talked to when it comes to like mushroom supplements, like reishi and lion's mane and all that stuff.
*  He takes all those.
*  That's the healthy stuff, but he liked the mushrooms that make you trip and shit.
*  He likes those too.
*  Yeah.
*  Changed him into a totally different person.
*  He's a different guy.
*  Totally different guy.
*  He's just like, just sweet, like at peace, calm guy.
*  I think he's vegan now too.
*  He's a, he's a, he's a vegetarian.
*  Vegetarian?
*  He eats pussy and vegetables.
*  Well, I can't knock on that because I'm a vegetarian myself.
*  No, he's a vegetarian.
*  I saw him not too long ago.
*  You know, him and I talking about doing a boxing match against each other in November.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  We trying to get that going.
*  What is going on with you and Shannon McKenna?
*  Bro, bro.
*  This motherfucker called me out.
*  Soon as I got knocked out by Fador, he called me out and he said he was going to promote the fight.
*  MMA guys, we're not promoters.
*  Wasn't it before that?
*  No, I don't remember.
*  You guys weren't drawing at each other before that?
*  No, I remember after that.
*  Let's go champ.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we were supposed to fight and we finally had a show.
*  We was going to do it in Qatar.
*  But the guys that put it on, they end up to be fucking scam artists.
*  Oh.
*  And I was trusting them.
*  I really liked the guys.
*  They was cool people, but fast talkers.
*  And like two months before I pulled out, Shannon was like, man, he was like, man, these guys are scammers, bro.
*  I'm like, man, you brought these motherfuckers to me.
*  He said, yeah, but I don't trust them no more.
*  They're scammers.
*  So I was like, man, they're going to go this fucking.
*  I was waiting to fight them.
*  But I heard there's talk again.
*  He's still trying, but I lost my faith in Shannon.
*  I don't know if he's going to get it done.
*  He talks a good game.
*  I hope he get it done.
*  If he ever gets it done, I'll be game to fight him.
*  But right now, I guess my first boxing match is going to be against Rashad.
*  I need to get that win back.
*  And where is that going to be?
*  They were talking about in Atlanta.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  For what organization?
*  I'm not sure.
*  But he said it was going to be under the one FC banner.
*  That's what he's telling me.
*  I'm waiting for my manager to talk to him.
*  Interesting.
*  One FC does everything.
*  That's an interesting organization because they'll have an event with grappling, kickboxing, Muay Thai and MMA.
*  I like that.
*  I love it.
*  I like that fight that Mite Mouse did with that Muay Thai guy.
*  That was very interesting.
*  His name is Rod Tang.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Rod Tang.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a wild dude.
*  He's tough, huh?
*  I see his clips on TikTok all the time.
*  He's dangerous.
*  Takes a crazy shot, too.
*  He's got an iron chin.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He just...
*  Yeah, let's guys hit him.
*  Come on, motherfucker.
*  Hit me.
*  That's crazy.
*  He kicks so fucking hard, too.
*  I guess those little guys, they can do that, though.
*  They can let people hit him.
*  Some people, you can't let crazy words hit you.
*  You know?
*  Like, different people.
*  Yeah, I get it.
*  Like, Polaton, when you see Pereira, there's not a fucking person in the world that can get hit by that guy.
*  No, I wouldn't let no big guy.
*  If I was...
*  No, not in two or five.
*  Two or five...
*  Did you watch Joe Pfeiffer fight at 85?
*  Who?
*  Joe Pfeiffer.
*  He's on 303?
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  He was the featured prelim of the undercard.
*  He's one of the hardest fucking punchers ever.
*  I got to the fight late.
*  I watched it when that girl got that cut.
*  I watched that in my first fight.
*  He was before that?
*  Okay.
*  He was before that, I believe.
*  Yeah, because my Robueno Silva was in the main card on pay-per-view in Macy's Chasson.
*  This is Joe Pfeiffer.
*  Which one?
*  With the white shorts?
*  Yeah.
*  This motherfucker can crack.
*  Oh my God.
*  What weight class is that?
*  85, and he's huge.
*  Yeah, 85.
*  He's huge, but he don't look 85.
*  I mean, he weighs 85 for about five minutes.
*  That fucking dude's huge.
*  Is he 85?
*  Yes.
*  I met him for the first time in Saudi Arabia, and that guy was big as fuck.
*  I was surprised when I saw him.
*  He was tall.
*  He's tall as fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  Tall and long.
*  The dude he's fighting, Drekis Du Plessis, that's another guy.
*  How the fuck do you weigh 85?
*  I stand next to that guy.
*  I'm like, how the fuck are you 185 pounds?
*  They must be cutting from 230, 220.
*  Oh, he's cutting from a lot.
*  He looks like a heavyweight.
*  When you stand next to Drekis, he's a big, wide motherfucker.
*  He's thick.
*  What's the weight class now in the UFC?
*  What's the it weight class?
*  When I was there, it was 205.
*  It's probably 205 right now, but the problem is Pereira is cleaned out of division.
*  There's only Ankolyev, who's very good.
*  That's a good fight, but a lot of people don't know who he is.
*  It's not like a big name fight.
*  Yuri Prohaska is a big name.
*  Everybody knows who he is.
*  He's got that crazy look with the bun, the samurai bun.
*  He shaved that shit off after the fight, though.
*  Did he?
*  He's like, what the fuck am I doing here with this thing?
*  Yeah, it did look kind of stupid, though.
*  Well, it looked crazy when he got hit because it bobs around.
*  Yeah, because the way he tapes it up and shit.
*  Why you got to tape it up?
*  It's in the back of your head.
*  It's not going to get in your face, right?
*  I don't think you should be allowed to have that because I think that gets in the way of stuff.
*  Because if you're trying to secure a choke, you're trying to go over the top of the head, there's a thing there.
*  For a split second, it might keep you from clasping your hands together.
*  For a split second, it might keep him from getting out of something.
*  It's in the way.
*  Just braid it.
*  Yeah, just braid it.
*  Don't put tape over it. I don't understand that.
*  I think he wants to be like a samurai.
*  He thinks himself as a Czech samurai.
*  Oh, he's Czech?
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't know where the fuck he was from.
*  He's a wild dude. He's a wild dude.
*  And he hits hard as fuck.
*  But that's not good enough when you're fighting a guy that's that skilled.
*  Bro, fighting Alex, I didn't like the way he had his hands down.
*  You don't fight a guy like Alex with your hands that low because it takes a while to get them up.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he likes to fight that way because he lures people in exchanges and he hits so hard.
*  And it works on everybody else. It worked on Rokic. It works on Dominic Reyes.
*  Everybody else, you don't want that guy standing in front of you.
*  Because he lures you in exchanges and he's willing to take a shot to give a shot.
*  And his punches are so hard.
*  But you can't do that with Pereira because Pereira is a better kickboxer, hits harder.
*  He's huge and he's just too slick.
*  He knows how to set things up.
*  He also knows it only takes one shot with him.
*  Yeah, he should have learned that the first time he fought him, right?
*  Get your hands up.
*  Well, the thing about the first time is what he won the first round of the first fight.
*  And then he was winning the second round before he got clipped.
*  And he actually had Pereira in a little bit of trouble.
*  There were some exchanges where he hit Pereira, had him moving backwards, but Alex is just too...
*  He hits you. It's too scary.
*  I was worried about Alex's chin, but that was at 85 when he had to cut all that weight.
*  You know you cut a lot of weight that folds up your chin.
*  100%. And his chin at 85 was not the same.
*  You got to think of how much weight he was cutting.
*  He was weighing in at 85 and then fighting at 225.
*  That's insane.
*  That's 40 fucking pounds, man.
*  In one day.
*  In a day. That's insane.
*  I don't know how he did it.
*  That weight cut is going to take...
*  I think that's what fucked me up with my health.
*  When you get older... Look at people like James Toney.
*  You see how he looks now?
*  You remember where he used to fight at?
*  Yeah. He used to be super middleweight.
*  I remember when he fought Roy Jones.
*  I remember when he fought everybody.
*  James Toney beat Evander at heavyweight.
*  James Toney was a bad man.
*  A bad man.
*  Hard to hit too.
*  But he cut a lot of weight.
*  I think that fucks up your metabolism or something down the line when you get older.
*  Cutting all that weight and then putting it back on.
*  Yeah. It does.
*  It fucks me up.
*  Yeah. I'm sure it does.
*  I'm sure it does.
*  It's terrible for your kidneys.
*  Who else? What's that Prince Hussein?
*  Have you seen him?
*  Yeah. He's big.
*  Yeah. He's big.
*  A lot of fighters go through that like Ricky Haddon.
*  I think he got his self under control now.
*  But he used to blow up.
*  And that fucks you up.
*  Yeah. But it's also like fighters when they're not training and they're not fighting anymore, they just start eating.
*  Oh man. Yeah. I was bad for that.
*  Yeah. They just eat like crazy.
*  You enjoy yourself because you have to be so disciplined in training camps.
*  And then after that you just, I used to always say, I'm just going to enjoy myself for like a week, then get back.
*  And I'm never going to get fat again.
*  I used to say this shit all the time.
*  Two weeks, bro. Two weeks. I'm back fucking fat as fuck.
*  Isn't it crazy how quick it gets back on you?
*  Yeah.
*  Especially if you're eating pizza and bullshit and if you're drinking.
*  Oh yeah. Drinking.
*  Drinking is number one.
*  Yeah.
*  Drinking puts it on you quick.
*  I think that's where Ricky Haddon was having a little bit of a problem.
*  Yeah.
*  But that happens to a lot of fighters, especially guys who've got some brain damage.
*  They really crave alcohol.
*  There's something about your dopamine levels drop.
*  And when you've had a significant amount of brain damage, you've been KO'd a bunch of times,
*  a lot of guys lean towards alcohol to make them feel better.
*  But it's all, you know, some people get KO'd and they're fine.
*  Like those K-1 guys. They don't even look gun shy.
*  You know when Vanellay knocked me out, that was my first time ever getting knocked out.
*  And I didn't even go all the way unconscious.
*  I remember hanging on the ropes. You remember that?
*  And I remember thinking like, damn, I just got knocked the fuck out.
*  And I can remember everything. I was dangling on the ropes.
*  I remember like blood dropping.
*  And then after that, I was gun shy all the way up to when I come in to fight Chuck Liddell.
*  And I remember those fights, I was gun shy.
*  And I was like, man, I got to fight Chuck Liddell.
*  He's like one of the best strikers I've been up against.
*  I need to bring somebody in to get me over this gun shyness.
*  And that's how I met Chet Congo.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I met him at the UFC once before. He was like a big scary looking guy.
*  And my manager called his manager and we flew him from France over to that training camp.
*  And he kicked the shit out of me.
*  And I got over that gun shyness.
*  Interesting.
*  It was a great camp.
*  Chet Congo was a beast. Remember that fight with Pat Berry?
*  Oh my God.
*  That is one of the craziest comebacks in the history of the sport.
*  Craziest one.
*  Pat Berry was just swinging. Pat Berry was a good kickboxer, man.
*  Real good kickboxer.
*  And Pat Berry had him real badly hurt.
*  And a lot of people could have stopped that fight.
*  And he went down a couple of times.
*  A couple of times.
*  And then he clipped him with one shot.
*  Boom.
*  Bro, that's Congo for you.
*  That guy countless times, he'd go through training camp, he'd get injured, won't tell nobody.
*  And he'd still go out there and fight.
*  I'm talking about with injuries that people would have to get surgeries for that wouldn't fight.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. I don't know what's wrong with him.
*  Here it is.
*  There it is. There's the one right hand that drops him.
*  And Pat just got reckless.
*  And he jumped all over him. Pat had big power too.
*  Look at the size of him.
*  Look at the size difference.
*  But yeah, I mean Congo was real tall and big, but Pat was a tank, man.
*  I think I was in Congo's corner, I can't remember.
*  But I was watching that fight.
*  I think I was doing a commentating up top.
*  Here it is. Boom.
*  That boom.
*  Out cold.
*  You don't even see it.
*  Yeah, you don't even see it.
*  He hit him with one, stung him, and then the other one, his eyes rolled back.
*  Oh, you see his eyes?
*  Yeah, they're still open.
*  Yeah, his eyes were rolled back.
*  He was out. He was in the dark lands.
*  Look at him. Oh my God.
*  Yeah, he was in the dark lands.
*  He just got too wild. He got too wild.
*  I mean, he had Congo hurt, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Real badly hurt.
*  Yeah, he was going there for the kill.
*  He gets clipped behind the ear, and then this one.
*  Boom.
*  I mean, that one just shut him off.
*  And you know, moving backwards kind of off angle, still crazy power.
*  But you know, Congo, it was a really good kickboxer too.
*  He beat Cro Cop.
*  Yep.
*  I didn't want to talk shit.
*  Congo was like my big bro, but I was real proud of him to beat Cro Cop.
*  Because Cro Cop is dangerous, man, with those leg kicks, those head kicks.
*  With every kick.
*  He's one of the hardest kickers ever.
*  There's a picture of him when he fought Heath Haring.
*  Did you ever see that fight?
*  Oh, yeah, he kicked him in the body.
*  He kicked him in the body, and his body is like, his shin is like halfway into his body.
*  It's a horrible picture.
*  And especially it's that left one, which is, you know, he said right kick hospital, left kick cemetery.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Cro Cop was the fucker.
*  Look at that.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's Josh Barnett.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, that was a good one.
*  That's one.
*  Look at that other one down there.
*  Oh.
*  Who is that?
*  Is that Sean O'Malley?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  Look at that kick.
*  Who did he kick there?
*  Good Lord.
*  Good Lord.
*  That is a liver all day.
*  I mean, that is deep in the liver.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's it.
*  The upper left-hand corner.
*  That's the one.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Look at that.
*  I mean, that shin is, that is a perfect, perfect kickboxer.
*  That's deep into the body.
*  The first time I met Cro Cop was when I fought K-1, prior to being in K-1, because it was
*  like my last fight of my contract.
*  They thought I was going to get knocked the fuck out and renegotiate for less money.
*  And I didn't expect for Cro Cop to like me.
*  They put us in a locker room together.
*  He was over there playing cards and stuff.
*  And this Japanese reporter come over to me and said, you know, I'm going to go to the
*  locker room.
*  I'm going to be the one that gets the money.
*  And this Japanese reporter come over to me.
*  I was on the ground, like stretching, warming up, whatever.
*  And I had my chain on the ground, which is crazy, because I never lay the chain down.
*  I don't know why I was on the ground.
*  And a Japanese lady came and she was like, oh, why do you got this chain?
*  What does this chain mean?
*  You know, I guess K-1 didn't know anything about me because I was coming from Pride.
*  And I put the chain on.
*  I said, oh, I'm a dog.
*  And I started, I started humping her.
*  And Cro Cop died laughing.
*  And ever since then, he liked me.
*  Every time I see him, he would come and I could make him laugh and stuff.
*  He was cool.
*  He's a cool guy.
*  He's a very cool guy.
*  He's one of the first guys that came from kickboxing that did really well in MMA because he was
*  so explosive.
*  Like a lot of those other guys like Peter Aerts or Ernesto Hust.
*  I don't know if their style would have translated because they would just set you up over time.
*  And Ernesto would be chopping at the legs and hit you with shots.
*  But Cro Cop would just, bah, just explode on you.
*  And he had good wrestling defense.
*  Antonio McKee, he was training with Cro Cop, teaching him wrestling.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Antonio McKee is one of the best wrestling coaches.
*  He's one of the best MMA coaches out there.
*  Well, he developed very good takedown defense.
*  And that's what made him so scary.
*  Because if you have to stand up with that guy, which shows you how good Fedor was in his
*  prime, because those two fought in their prime and Fedor was walking him down.
*  Stand up.
*  Stand up.
*  I mean, that was primarily a stand up fight.
*  Fedor gives no fucks.
*  He was a wild dude, man.
*  Even though he beat my ass, he's still one of my favorite fighters.
*  Yeah, one of mine as well.
*  I think, you know, when you look at the great heavyweights of all time, it's so hard to say,
*  like, who's the greatest of all time, but you've got to have him in the conversation.
*  I wish he would have came to the UFC, though.
*  I wish they would have got close.
*  Got close.
*  Got real close.
*  They had some meetings.
*  But apparently, the people that Fedor had running with him, the people that were running his
*  business, they wanted a lot.
*  They wanted like co-promotion with the UFC.
*  They wanted, they didn't, it wasn't just like, give us some money.
*  And, you know, I guess the UFC was willing to give them a lot of money, but they were like,
*  no, we want co-promotion.
*  Yeah, that's too much.
*  They wanted to be a part of the business.
*  They wanted to take over a little bit of the business.
*  Yeah, I heard rumors they wanted to have like rights to UFC Russia or some shit.
*  There's a bunch of different things.
*  You'd have to talk to Dana, but I remember it was enough so that they had a beef up security.
*  Like, they were worried about how the negotiations went south.
*  Wow.
*  They got nervous.
*  It was a weird time.
*  Those guys that were with him, they were serious dudes.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I would like to fight Fedor again.
*  You know, that was my last fight.
*  And I wasn't me.
*  I was very unhealthy, but I didn't like-
*  Why were you unhealthy?
*  What was wrong?
*  Because I got mixed diagnosed with-
*  Hypothyroidism?
*  Yeah, so I was on this medicine.
*  And the medicine was making me fat.
*  And I was training hard.
*  What kind of medicine did you have?
*  Do you remember?
*  I forgot the name of it, but I had been on this-
*  Synthroid?
*  Yeah.
*  And I had been on it for a while.
*  And then I started training with T.J. Dillashaw and Warren Archuleta.
*  And they took me over there to Coach Cowell.
*  And that guy's a genius.
*  Yeah, he's a genius.
*  He's like a scientist.
*  So he looked at my blood, and he looked through everything.
*  And he was like, you don't have a thyroid problem, dude.
*  Something wrong with your T3 or T3, whatever the fuck he said.
*  But you don't have a thyroid problem.
*  The problem in that medicine you take is it's fucking you up.
*  And I just quit the medicine.
*  I said, I knew it was the fucking medicine.
*  But he said, hey, I don't suggest you just quit cold turkey.
*  You don't know how your body is going to react.
*  And then I said, fuck this.
*  This medicine is fucking me up.
*  I'm quitting it.
*  And when I got to Japan, one of my coaches told me, oh, you got to carb up before you fight.
*  You got to carb up.
*  Because he noticed I wasn't eating carbs.
*  And I listened to my coach.
*  I'm a very coachable fighter.
*  And I just got bloated overnight.
*  I wasn't even looking that big when I got to Japan.
*  And I just fucking blew up.
*  And I said, fuck it, I'm fighting.
*  I'm not pulling out this fight.
*  You were thinking about pulling out?
*  Yeah. When I fucking saw myself in the fucking mirror, I was like, what the fuck is this?
*  That's what you thought about pulling out?
*  Yeah.
*  Just because I was fighting.
*  Because I trained hard.
*  I noticed I wasn't losing weight for the fight.
*  But I was heavyweight.
*  I always wanted to get my weight down and look good.
*  But I got down on 265.
*  And I was training really hard.
*  People thought I didn't train.
*  People thought I threw the fight.
*  I was training hard.
*  It's the hardest I ever trained.
*  But I wasn't doing a whole lot of sparring and shit though.
*  Because when I was training with Coach Kyle, that was the hardest training I ever did.
*  And it's so hard that you have to take the rest of the day off and the next morning.
*  Because it's like so it's heavy cardio, right?
*  Yes.
*  Crazy.
*  We're throwing 100 pound medicine balls at each other.
*  100 pound?
*  100 pound medicine.
*  While we was balancing on a bo shoe ball.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  With TJ Dillashaw and one Achuleta.
*  I don't know if you know one Achuleta.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  You know how small that guy is?
*  Yeah.
*  Coach Kyle had us flipping tires up a hill.
*  Like 200, 400 pound tires.
*  I never flipped a tire before.
*  This motherfucker used to flip his tire up a hill, run down and help me flip mine.
*  That's how strong that little motherfucker is.
*  Yeah, he's strong as fuck.
*  He's a great wrestler.
*  Yeah, great wrestler.
*  And they have you on that spin bike.
*  It's like a hard spin bike type of thing.
*  For like an hour.
*  Bro, it was torture.
*  But I said, you know what?
*  I'm going to do this shit.
*  I'm going to train really hard.
*  And at the end of the day, all this shit fucked me up.
*  So I cursed those two specialists that I saw.
*  I saw two different specialists and they didn't do shit.
*  They said, oh, you got to be on this medicine for the rest of your life.
*  And the second one, I thought I saw Coach Kyle.
*  I went to somebody and they did what you call an MRI on my thyroid.
*  And they were saying that it's not enough data yet to know if you damaged your
*  thyroid from putting a lot of real naked chokes.
*  They said it's not enough data yet.
*  Because I asked them, have you ever been in a real naked choke and you fight so hard
*  and your throat hurt a little bit?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, I asked them about that.
*  They said, yeah, it's not enough data yet.
*  You guys haven't been doing this shit long enough for us to know.
*  That makes sense.
*  That makes sense that it would hurt your thyroid.
*  I mean, it's right there.
*  It's right there.
*  So they don't know shit yet.
*  I mean, you'd imagine.
*  Your organs are getting hurt by getting kicked.
*  They bleed.
*  You piss blood after you get kicked in the body a bunch of times.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I would imagine it hurts your thyroid.
*  I mean, if someone's got a real good squeeze, they get your neck.
*  That happened to me several times over the years, but I didn't really think anything
*  of it.
*  And how many times in training?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, constantly.
*  That's where they get.
*  Well, that's where most people get really beat up from, really.
*  Right?
*  Most of the brain damage that people get is from training.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially in the early days when people basically just fought in the gym.
*  Do you remember when Marvin Eastman fought Travis Luthor?
*  No, I didn't see that one.
*  Marvin Eastman fought Travis Luthor in the UFC, and Travis Luthor caught him with a right
*  hand and knocked him out cold.
*  But it was like at the end of the punch, it didn't look normal.
*  It looked like something was wrong.
*  And what I had heard was that Marvin Eastman had been KO'd twice in camp.
*  At least once.
*  I know he got KO'd at least once.
*  I think it was by Tito.
*  I think they were wrestling.
*  This was after I fought Marvin or before it?
*  After you fought Marvin.
*  Because you fought Marvin in 2000.
*  This was in the UFC.
*  Oh, okay.
*  He was in the UFC.
*  You fought Marvin in the UFC as well.
*  Yeah, 2007.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if the Travis Luthor fight was before or after that fight.
*  See if you can see it.
*  Find it, Jamie.
*  Travis Luthor, KO's Marvin Eastman.
*  Because Travis, who was an awesome jujitsu guy, wasn't known as being like this crazy
*  puncher.
*  But when you see guys that have fought that have been hurt real bad in the gym, that happens
*  all the time.
*  Guys get KO'd in the gym.
*  That's what happens is Ninja.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  The shoot box guy that was sparring so hard, he fucked up his career.
*  Here it is.
*  2004.
*  So this is before you fought Marvin Eastman.
*  That's right.
*  You fought Marvin Eastman about 2007.
*  Yeah.
*  So he catches him on the end of this punch.
*  And Travis Luthor, man, Travis Luthor was one of the best Brazilian jujitsu black belts
*  to ever compete in MMA.
*  And he was a guy that, he was the worst weight cut I ever saw in my life, ever.
*  When he fought Anderson for the title.
*  So look at this.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's a good right hand, but it seemed crazy, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I think your chin just goes sometimes.
*  Yes.
*  But what I had heard from him was that he had been KO'd in training pretty bad.
*  Do you think it's mental?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't think that one was mental.
*  I think if you've been KO'd, I think your brain's damaged.
*  Just like if you hurt your hand.
*  If you break your hand and it's still fucked up and you try to punch someone, it's going to get hurt.
*  Same thing with your head.
*  But you would think that, you know, because your body heals itself, you would think your brain would rejuvenate over time.
*  It doesn't really.
*  It doesn't?
*  No.
*  No.
*  There's a lot of problems with the brain and healing.
*  And one of the problems, there's a lot, right?
*  But one of the problems is the tissue, the connective tissue that keeps the brain centered in the skull.
*  That stuff rips over time.
*  And that stuff is, once it's gone, it's gone.
*  It doesn't return.
*  It doesn't heal back.
*  It's just like taking your meniscus out of your knee.
*  And your brain is just slapping around inside of there.
*  And guys get KO'd way easier.
*  Do you think stem cells help that?
*  Because I believe in stem cells.
*  I do too.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I know you go to that bioaccelerator place, which is great.
*  A lot of people have gone there.
*  It changed my life.
*  Yeah.
*  Stem cells are incredible.
*  But I don't know if it helps that.
*  Brain rejuvenation.
*  Especially not helps you take a shot.
*  It might help you heal from too many head injuries.
*  But I don't think it helps your ability to take a punch.
*  I think once that goes, that's gone.
*  You knowing that, would you let your son fight?
*  I would let my son fight before I let him do football.
*  Football is way worse.
*  I think it's way worse.
*  They did a study on CTE with football.
*  And they went from high school all the way into NFL players.
*  And even in high school kids, most of them have it.
*  And then you get into NFL.
*  People play all the time.
*  They played Pee-wee.
*  They played junior high school, high school.
*  Most likely they have some form of CTE.
*  And then you get into, if you get into NFL, it's like 90 plus percent of the guys have CTE.
*  I never heard of this shit until recently.
*  We had Chandler Jones on our podcast.
*  Our Jones Jones brother.
*  You met him before?
*  No.
*  I've seen him at the UFC.
*  He seems like a real cool guy.
*  But he was saying that people diagnose him with CTE.
*  But he said he didn't believe in it.
*  Wasn't Chandler the one that had some sort of an incident where he went crazy?
*  Yeah, he did have something.
*  A lot of people don't believe in things that are still real.
*  Facts.
*  I didn't know what, I'm just not hearing about this shit now though.
*  You seem fine.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Fuck that.
*  You know, I don't take a whole lot of punches.
*  I got that cover and roll, baby.
*  I got that cover and roll.
*  Yeah, you've always been defensively responsible like that.
*  Several leg kicks.
*  Several leg kicks.
*  Leg kicks.
*  You got mad at me once.
*  But I wanted you to throw more because your leg kicks are devastating.
*  I would see when you would hit guys with leg kicks.
*  I was like, damn, I wish Quentin would throw more leg kicks.
*  I got to apologize to you about that.
*  Well, I apologize to you too.
*  I'm like, it's not personal.
*  I just, when I'm looking at you, I'm not thinking of you as a human being when you're fighting.
*  I know you're a human being, but I'm looking at, I'm analyzing movements and what I think a guy can do to be more successful.
*  I don't even, I mean, it hurt your feelings.
*  No, you didn't hurt my feelings.
*  It was nothing that you say.
*  I'm going to clear it up for you right now.
*  It wasn't nothing you said.
*  It's the fucking fans.
*  They all come, when you said it, you kept saying it, they all come to me on my social media.
*  Everything's social media.
*  So I'm going to explain to you, this is, you remember when I was fighting in Pride, I would check leg kicks if they was hard.
*  Except for Arona, I wasn't going to check his leg kicks because it would have hurt my knee.
*  Wow.
*  But I would check leg kicks if they were hard.
*  But people in the UFC, they wasn't really kicking that hard.
*  Really?
*  No, their leg kicks wasn't that hard.
*  So I'd take them and I'd try laying a punch.
*  But the reason why I wasn't kicking that much is because they were desperately trying to take me down.
*  Even though I could wrestle, I started late.
*  I'm not the best wrestler.
*  And if you want to take somebody down, you're going to get them when they got their leg up.
*  But you were a very good MMA wrestler.
*  You knew how to use it in MMA.
*  Yeah.
*  I was never good at one art.
*  When I put them together, that's when I felt like I was coming together.
*  So one time I tried to kick when they had me fight Matt Hamill.
*  That's the only fight I ever wanted to back out of.
*  I never wanted to fight that guy.
*  Why?
*  Because I just felt like he was a boring fighter and I got tired of fighting wrestlers that hold me down and hump me and shit.
*  And I'm like, you know, it's fucking, for me, I like exciting fights.
*  I'd rather lose an exciting fight than win a boring fight.
*  This has been my style.
*  And I didn't want to fight him.
*  So I remember when I was fighting him and it was back in my head.
*  I was like, Joe Rogan going to talk about me and Matt fucking kicking and shit.
*  So I threw a fucking kick and sure enough, he almost took me down.
*  I did not want that guy on top of me.
*  So I said, fuck this.
*  I never kicked again after that.
*  That's funny.
*  I kick in practice.
*  When I spar, stuff like that.
*  I love Muay Thai.
*  I started taking Muay Thai right after that fight with Sakuraba.
*  I started training with Colin Oyama when he was training Tito.
*  I went straight up to Big Bear and I started training.
*  Colin's very good.
*  Yeah.
*  He taught me the cover and roll.
*  Yeah.
*  I learned a lot from that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  He's very good.
*  He's trained a lot of MMA fighters.
*  Yeah.
*  It's interesting when you see those guys that were around in the early days that are still around now.
*  Yeah.
*  And how many different iterations of MMA they've seen.
*  The game has changed so much.
*  You watch young guys now.
*  There's guys that are entering into the UFC now that are elite fighters.
*  They're already elite.
*  First fight in the UFC.
*  Yeah.
*  They're world class.
*  It's crazy.
*  You remember how it started off?
*  You just knew one motherfucking thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Yep.
*  Wrestling or kickboxing or jiu-jitsu.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  One of those things you were good at and everything else you were just hoping to get to whatever
*  the fuck it was that you do.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was crazy when people like Carl Parisian came around with Judo.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  He's motherfucking doing Judo?
*  Carl was throwing people through the air.
*  Carl was one of the best Judo guys to ever compete in MMA.
*  He was fucking good, man.
*  Yeah.
*  He was good.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I had to train Judo one time.
*  It made me respect it a lot more.
*  I was fighting, I forgot the damn guy's name.
*  I think it's Ishii something.
*  He was a Judo gold medalist or some shit.
*  I had to fight him in Bellator, a big motherfucker.
*  So I had to train Judo.
*  I trained for like a week.
*  I gave up.
*  I said, fuck this, man.
*  My wrestling going to take care of this shit.
*  Well, those guys are so, Judo guys are so strong because they're throwing bodies around
*  all the time.
*  There's always like hoisting bodies through the air and throwing them around.
*  I rolled with Carl once.
*  He was like the hardest guy ever.
*  Like, his body was like, he didn't look impressive, but he was crazy strong like a chimpanzee.
*  Like, just throws you around.
*  There's like, there's such an evidence, like a big difference in strength with a guy like
*  that that's just used to throwing, like Hector Lombard.
*  He's another one.
*  Hector, crazy powerful.
*  Yeah.
*  Kara Parison, he used to train with me, Tito, and I think Randy Couture.
*  He used to kick all three of our asses, take turns, and we all big into him.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, he was a beast.
*  He was a beast, man.
*  He was a beast.
*  I remember his fight with Diego Sanchez.
*  Holy shit, that was a wild fight.
*  I like to see him come back because-
*  Kara?
*  Yeah.
*  How old is Kara now?
*  He got to be younger than me.
*  I'm 46 now.
*  He got to be younger than me.
*  You know?
*  Kara had a bad leg injury, and he tore his hamstring and never got it surgically repaired.
*  So, he was always like, one leg was always like 40% of what it should have been.
*  It was bad to the point where he had to take painkillers and a bunch of shit.
*  He had a hole in the back of his leg.
*  Like, you ever see a guy that like tears their bicep and they get that weird, where it curls up?
*  That was how his leg looked.
*  So, the back of his leg had like a hole in it.
*  Like, his hamstring was gone.
*  It's hard to come back from next year.
*  Yeah, so he could have had it, but he would have had to have surgery right after the tear, and he didn't.
*  And so, once it curls up and locks in place, I guess they can't bring it back.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  How do you feel about the older guys like me, Rashad, and Mark Coleman, all of us fighting in a league with other older guys instead of putting us with younger people?
*  That's not a bad idea.
*  Like, a Legends league?
*  Yeah, because we still love it.
*  We still love the fight, you know?
*  But we just can't compete with the…
*  The youngest guys.
*  Yeah, Father Time is undefeated, bro.
*  Father Time never loses.
*  And not only that, like these young guys haven't had all the injuries that the older guys have had.
*  You know, you see older guys, they look fine, but who knows what the fucking neck, my knee, my hip, my fucking wrist.
*  There's always something.
*  If you've had 25 MMA fights, 35 MMA fights, you got problems.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no ifs, ands, or what's about it.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know anybody who's not banged up.
*  Man, when I get out of bed in the morning, like the first couple steps, I'm like, damn, was it worth it?
*  Yeah, but you came out better than most people.
*  Yeah, I didn't have to.
*  I already had an injury coming into MMA.
*  My knee was fucked.
*  I fucked my knee up in college, but I haven't had too much.
*  What'd you do with your knee in college?
*  Man, my teammates, half of my teammates wasn't coming to practice, and the coach was like,
*  since you guys are not getting your teammates here, you got to work out for them.
*  So they used to pair us up in groups of twos and make us do 15 push-ups.
*  Other guys do 15 reps, then you go all the way down to five, right?
*  And after two weeks of that, we got so strong, we was bombing out on everything, right?
*  So I'm wrestling one of my teammates, and he tried to get a single leg on me.
*  And this is right when I was getting better at wrestling.
*  I was getting good.
*  It was hard to take me down and everything.
*  I was in last in junior college, and the wrestlers there, they was like the rejects, but they was all good.
*  They had to come there first, then they went to D1 schools, right?
*  And I'm wrestling this guy, and he's still my friend to this day.
*  He gave me an ad to tell the story.
*  And he was going there for a single, and I wasn't giving it up, because everybody was talking shit to me.
*  I was the runt on the team.
*  He was the worst wrestler there.
*  And I think I took him down, and he wanted to get his takedown back, and he took my leg,
*  and he bent it sideways and went, pop!
*  And I think he told my meniscus of some shit.
*  And last thing, they didn't even take me to the...
*  I don't even know what happened.
*  They never got me MRI'd.
*  They just threw me away.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  That was it?
*  Yeah.
*  I let it heal up on its own.
*  And it never got 100%?
*  It never was the same.
*  Wow.
*  And then I think that was my meniscus.
*  I don't know, but I injured my meniscus when I was training for Ryan Bader.
*  I had a little partial tear, and the doctor told me, no, you don't want to fight, because
*  you can rip it all away, and it's not a fight in Japan.
*  It's hard for me to pull out in Japan.
*  That's why I think it's a good idea for me to go over there and make some babies.
*  Well, it's amazing what they can do with stem cells now, because I had a tear on my right
*  knee, and I got stem cells on it.
*  I had a couple different cycles of stem cells.
*  Now it doesn't bother me at all.
*  And I was like, fuck, I'm going to have to get it done on my right knee, too, because
*  I had my right knee part of my meniscus removed.
*  Because it was a bucket handle tear, so you know it would lock out.
*  So it would lock straight.
*  It would pop.
*  And then you can't bend your knee.
*  You're like, oh my god.
*  And it's painful as fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to have Noriko Rodriguez.
*  I used to corner him one time, and he was fighting.
*  And that was my job, each round to pull his leg out.
*  Yeah, Rico didn't have an ACL.
*  He fought at the highest level with no ACL.
*  He was the first guy I ever heard that did that.
*  I'm like, that is crazy.
*  He didn't give a fuck.
*  Crazy.
*  It's crazy what fighters put up with.
*  I know.
*  Well, there's fighters right now that are fighting with no ACLs.
*  I know a couple of them.
*  Football players wouldn't do that shit, huh?
*  No.
*  No, you get it repaired.
*  I think we should get doctors like them.
*  You know how they have, what you call those, physios?
*  I think we should have that on every team.
*  Have a set of physios and people that, because we don't know what the fuck we're doing.
*  Even today, we don't know shit.
*  Well, that's why the UFC Performance Institute is so important.
*  They got that there?
*  They have everything.
*  Everything.
*  What?
*  I thought Lee was the guy who did shit.
*  The UFC Performance Institute is one of the most high-level training environments in the world.
*  People come and do their camp in Vegas.
*  If they know they're going to fight in Vegas, they'll come to Vegas and bring their coaches,
*  and everybody does their whole camp at the PI.
*  PI is incredible.
*  I've never been there.
*  Oh my God, it's amazing.
*  They videotape all the sparring sessions so you can watch it from multiple different angles.
*  They have it up for you.
*  You can review.
*  Like, see, you do this.
*  You drop your hands.
*  You do this.
*  You can't defend like that.
*  You have to do this way.
*  And you watch it all on high-def videotape.
*  They charge you for camp?
*  No, no.
*  You just go train there.
*  What the fuck?
*  Yeah, all the UFC athletes can go train there.
*  They have nutrition.
*  They feed you.
*  Yeah.
*  For free?
*  Oh yeah, they'll set you up with meals.
*  For free?
*  Uh-huh.
*  Not only that, it's all nutritionally balanced for like, they'll work with a nutritionist
*  for your weight cut, for everything.
*  Yeah.
*  All healthy foods.
*  I got more respect for the UFC now.
*  Oh, it's incredible.
*  The place is amazing.
*  I did a tour of it.
*  It was amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  I mean, they have sauna, cold plunge, like you name it.
*  Every modality, red light, anything that can help you heal, anything that helps you get
*  better.
*  And it's for free for the fighters.
*  For free, for free.
*  All the strength and conditioning equipment, anything you need, bags, everything.
*  Everything you need.
*  You just gotta be on the UFC roster to use it.
*  If you're on the UFC roster, you go there and train.
*  Say what you want about Uncle Dana, buddy.
*  He did a lot for this sport.
*  Oh my God, without him, this wouldn't be possible.
*  Like, you see what happens with these other organizations with regular dudes running it.
*  They all fold up.
*  They fall apart.
*  You know, like the UFC have the name in the beginning, but they ran with it after that.
*  Like, because Pride had a name too, man.
*  Pride, people don't know, Pride was bigger in Japan than the UFC was in America.
*  At the time, Pride, way before the UFC could ever do this, Pride was selling out 90,000
*  seat stadiums.
*  Yeah, I remember it.
*  Pride was like almost at the level of NBA is here in Japan.
*  Like, I remember fighting.
*  Then the next day, my corner man, they would go and get a newspaper, a Japanese newspaper.
*  And I'd be on the front page of the fucking newspaper.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, like you never see that shit here.
*  No.
*  Well, you kind of do now.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, now you see what newspapers don't really exist anymore.
*  But like when it comes to like news coverage, like my news feed was overwhelmed with Alex
*  Pereira's knockout.
*  Oh, for real?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, that's good.
*  Yeah, there was so many pictures of it because it was a giant event.
*  ESPN, though.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But all these different websites were covering it because it's just, first of all, like when
*  you got a guy that's that dominant, you know, that's what people love.
*  They love a Mike Tyson.
*  They love some dude who's just fucking everybody up.
*  Like, you can't wait to watch him fight people because you know what's going to happen.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, he's going to fuck people up.
*  Yeah.
*  What fucked up Pride was they lost the contract with Fuji TV.
*  It's crazy that it could be so big in Japan and then dwindle away to almost nothing.
*  So you see events from Japan now.
*  It's like a shadow of what it was.
*  Yeah, Risen, you would think that Risen would do what Pride did.
*  Right.
*  You would think.
*  You would think Ryzen would like, it would fill in the gap.
*  Like if the UFC went away, the PFL would probably take up the slack.
*  You know, if something happened, someone, the UFC decided, you know what, we found Jesus.
*  We're not, no more fights.
*  Everybody, good luck.
*  Take care.
*  We're going to close shop for some crazy reason.
*  Those guys will go somewhere and there's, everyone has a name, you know.
*  Right now, the only way an organization could benefit, like PFL signed Francis.
*  That's probably the only way that PFL is going to get people to pay attention.
*  Like you have to have someone like Francis.
*  But who is he going to fight though?
*  This is a wild Brazilian dude over there who's fucking dangerous.
*  The big guy that beat up Ryan Bader?
*  Yes. That guy's fucking dangerous.
*  He's huge.
*  He's huge and he can strike.
*  But that's the only guy.
*  That's the only guy.
*  I mean, maybe if Francis, if the PFL gets some heat behind it because of this, maybe if they have the money.
*  Like I know there's some other countries that are involved, like the Saudis, if they get involved and they start throwing money away, maybe.
*  You think he'll go back to boxing?
*  Yeah, because he's made so much money.
*  You know, but you know, after the Joshua fight, it's going to be different, right?
*  So the Francis and Gano fight, it was, you know, he's fighting one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time and drops him in the second round.
*  And everybody's like, what?
*  And then he beat him up in the eighth round too.
*  I thought he won that fight.
*  I thought he won that fight too.
*  Yeah, I thought he won that fight too.
*  But, you know, if they're setting up that Usyk fight, they were not going to.
*  Yeah.
*  It just seemed like the fix was in.
*  Well, yeah, it was close enough that they could pull it off.
*  They can go, OK, maybe, maybe you could see him winning that.
*  But I don't think so.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought Francis won it.
*  A lot of people thought Francis won it.
*  Yeah, that's that big guy, huh?
*  This dude.
*  What is his name?
*  Henin Ferreira.
*  Henin Ferreira.
*  He's big too.
*  He's like six, seven.
*  Whoa, what the?
*  Look at that knee.
*  Six, eight, two, sixty.
*  Six, eight, two, sixty.
*  Yeah, bro.
*  I think Francis can get him though.
*  Oh, yeah, man.
*  Look, Francis can get anyone, anyone alive, anyone alive.
*  If that guy hits you, he could put you asleep.
*  Man, Francis surprised me when he knocked out Alistair Oberin.
*  That's when he gave him a mic read.
*  I was like, who the fuck is this guy?
*  Bro, that is to this day one of the scariest left hooks of all time
*  because his head snapped so far back.
*  It was like he was looking at his feet.
*  He was looking at his ankles behind himself.
*  It was crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  I never saw that.
*  Then when he knocked out Stipe, good lord.
*  I mean, with the little gloves on and leg kicks and shit,
*  there's not a whole lot like that one.
*  Come on, man.
*  That kind of power?
*  Yeah.
*  Francis, man.
*  Dude, I took a picture with Francis in Saudi Arabia.
*  That motherfucker is twice my size.
*  He's huge.
*  He's big.
*  He's huge.
*  I'm happy that he went and got paid.
*  I'm happy that he got that money for the Tyson Fury fight
*  because everybody was dismissing it.
*  Dana was dismissing it.
*  And then he drops Tyson Fury, and a lot of people's eyes won the fight.
*  Like, fuck yeah.
*  And then he gets a big payday against Joshua.
*  I'm happy that he made money,
*  but I wish he would have made that money in the UFC.
*  I wish my dream fight was at heavyweight, John Jones and Francis.
*  And I still think to this, there was actually an article that I read this morning
*  that with the Saudis, you know, the UFC is now doing shows in Saudi Arabia,
*  that Dana is not opposed to the possibility of a joint promotion
*  with John Jones versus Francis.
*  Wow, that would be huge.
*  Huge.
*  Huge.
*  With all due respect,
*  I think John Jones is a smart enough fighter to not fight Francis' fight on El Mundo.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  John Jones, he ain't no dummy.
*  He's a smart fighter.
*  I always say John Jones is neo.
*  Neo for the Matrix?
*  Yeah.
*  The kid, his mind is so strong.
*  I think that he would desperately try to get Francis down and submit him.
*  He won't be dumb enough to stand with him.
*  No, he won't stand with him.
*  John, as good as he is, has never been like a one-punch knockout guy.
*  No.
*  You know, he beats guys up and strangles them and beats them up on the ground.
*  Does he have any knockouts?
*  From one shot?
*  I mean, he head kicked Daniel Cormier.
*  Yeah.
*  And dropped him with that and then beat him up on the ground and stopped him.
*  Yeah.
*  Most of the time, he just mauls people on the ground.
*  Yeah.
*  When he punched me, he was like, I was more worried about the eye pokes than the punch.
*  He does a lot of that.
*  What do you think about that, man?
*  Like, the gloves that they have, I think to this day, I know the UFC changed their gloves and they got new gloves now.
*  I think the new gloves are definitely better than the old gloves.
*  But Trevor Whitman has the best gloves ever.
*  You ever see his gloves?
*  No.
*  I think that when the UFC gloves was coming out, coming out with new gloves, I heard that somebody invented gloves that keep your hand kind of curled.
*  That's Trevor Whitman.
*  Oh, OK.
*  But they didn't go with that one?
*  No.
*  Apparently, Trevor wanted some crazy amount of money for the gloves for the UFC.
*  For the padding?
*  I don't know what to sell his design, his product, whatever.
*  And he wanted a lot of money, apparently, and the UFC wasn't willing to.
*  They were trying to make a deal with him, and I was telling Dana, get his gloves, man.
*  They're way better.
*  Excuse me.
*  And his gloves are curved.
*  They're curved so that your hand sits like this always.
*  So that's his boxing gloves there.
*  But what about his bag or his MMA gloves?
*  Does it show the Onyx?
*  Onyx is his company, ONX, MMA glove.
*  That's the sparring glove.
*  But there it is.
*  I'm wearing it.
*  OK.
*  That's it.
*  That's when Justin did my podcast and I put his glove on.
*  See how it's curved?
*  Yeah.
*  That's not even me making a fist.
*  That's just putting it on.
*  You put it on, it's curved.
*  That makes sense.
*  But why he didn't just back off on the price a little bit?
*  He should have, for sure.
*  Here's my thought, and tell me what you think about this.
*  The UFC gloves, the way they are right now, why don't they cover the fingers?
*  Why don't you have a glove where you have the padding on the knuckle,
*  but that you have a layer of leather that goes over the fingers and goes behind the hand like this?
*  That way, even if you do have your hands open, you'll be running into it like this.
*  Like a mitt?
*  You're talking about like a mitt almost?
*  Yeah, like a mitt.
*  Almost like pride gloves a little bit, but over the fingers?
*  But covering the fingertips.
*  I think the grapplers will get upset about that.
*  But why?
*  Because you never do this.
*  You never interlace your fingers together, right?
*  That's Hayabusa.
*  Yeah, but I know, but like that?
*  No, I mean covering the tips of the fingers.
*  The tips are still going to be there.
*  The problem was the tips.
*  The problem is the fingertips going into the eyes.
*  Like every time you see a poke, it's like one finger going into the eyeball.
*  But if you have it covered up, at least it would be different.
*  Like it wouldn't be one poke going straight through.
*  It would be a layer that's covering, a layer of leather that covers over the tip of the finger.
*  I need to see those.
*  I'll tell you this, I've been fighting for 25 years.
*  I've never poked anybody in the eye, not even in training.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I never.
*  Why you got to do this shit?
*  You shouldn't do that.
*  Exactly.
*  John is a master.
*  Bro, I was begging the referee.
*  I was begging the referee.
*  I'm like, look, I never do that in fights.
*  I never take my attention off my opponent.
*  I was going to that fight, I was thinking about wearing goggles out, walking out.
*  Because I knew he was going to poke me in the eye.
*  I got poked in the eye in training camp trying to train that shit.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And I had like a little red spot in there.
*  And when we did the stare down, I know he saw that shit.
*  I'm like, damn.
*  I'm getting him a fucking target.
*  Goddamn.
*  He's really good at those leg kicks too.
*  Those oblique kicks to the knee.
*  I think that should be illegal, bro.
*  You think so?
*  Yeah.
*  See, I'm thinking about starting my own MMA league, like rampage style.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  My own, what I think MMA should be like, right?
*  And I'm going to make that shit illegal.
*  That one thing.
*  That one side kick to the knee?
*  Oh, that oblique kick.
*  Fuck that shit.
*  Did you see the one Khalil Rowntree landed?
*  Oh my God.
*  I got on him about that shit.
*  Oh my God.
*  Did you get on him about it?
*  Hell yeah.
*  What did he say?
*  He's like, man, fuck that.
*  It was a fucking technique.
*  It is a technique.
*  But that guy got some scary Muay Thai skills.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to go where the fuck he went and train.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I don't know which camp he went to.
*  Oh my God.
*  I can't even, bro, I can't even watch this shit.
*  I know.
*  It's horrible.
*  He tore his knee apart.
*  Bukakis was out for like a solid year after that.
*  Look at that side kick right to the knee.
*  Bro, that should be illegal, bro.
*  Oh man, full power.
*  I can't even watch that shit.
*  Just tears his knee apart.
*  It's horrible.
*  Bro, John bent mine backwards.
*  My knee haven't been the same.
*  But when I went and got stem cells, thank God.
*  Bro, that shit changed my life.
*  I took my knee braces out.
*  I could wrestle without my knee braces and shit after that.
*  But before that, it was hard for me getting in and out of my cars and everything.
*  And I bumped into John Jones one day.
*  We was at a nightclub or something.
*  And you know how I am.
*  I fucking, I cussed him out.
*  He was like, oh man, I'm sorry.
*  And he was like, come on over here with me.
*  We was going to go somewhere else.
*  And we had to walk up on some couches and shit.
*  And I tried to get up there.
*  I couldn't because this was before I went and got stem cells.
*  I couldn't get up there because of my fucking knee.
*  I laid it on thick like the Jewish guilt.
*  I laid it on thick and he felt bad.
*  And for me, that was good enough.
*  I forgave him after that because he did feel bad.
*  But my thing about fighting, I feel like we all comrades.
*  And that's how we make our living.
*  So I never tried to really hurt nobody besides Arona.
*  He made me lose my temper.
*  That's why I did that with him.
*  But nobody else I never really tried to hurt anybody so they can continue to keep making money.
*  So I just have honor when I fight.
*  And I want everybody to understand.
*  Look, this is just a sport.
*  I'm not trying to fucking, I'm trying to knock you out and stuff like that.
*  But I'm not going to try to maim you.
*  Thiago Santos, he ruined both his knees.
*  John did.
*  Yeah, both his knees after that fight had to get surgery on.
*  He tore both of them apart.
*  He side kicked the fuck out of his knees.
*  He does the oblique kick to the thigh too.
*  He does it everywhere.
*  So think about this.
*  You're a promoter and you got this fighter that sells a lot of tickets.
*  So you want to give him at least two fights a year, three fights a year.
*  But you got a guy like John Jones fucking your fighters up, man.
*  Now they fucking injured you.
*  You'd be lucky they come back in two years or something like that.
*  It's not good for business.
*  It's definitely not good for business, but it's still legal.
*  It's legal right now.
*  So it's like, it's hard to say.
*  I see the point that you shouldn't be allowed to target the knees.
*  But then someone would say, okay, but you could Brown House kick the knees.
*  But you just can't side kick it.
*  You can't hyperextend it.
*  Can you front kick it?
*  No, you can't front kick it.
*  Right.
*  Darren Till does it too.
*  He was doing it a lot.
*  He fucked up Wonder Boys knee that way.
*  Yeah, it's like the elbows.
*  Like you're allowed to elbow somebody but not in the back of the head.
*  Right.
*  But you remember John's spin elbow?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Where did it land most of the time?
*  Back of the head.
*  Well, how about wheel kicks and Brown House kicks?
*  A lot of times they land in the back of the head too.
*  Yeah.
*  You go over the top of the shoulder, bang, it's over the back of the head.
*  Yeah.
*  That's nice.
*  Yeah, but those don't come off that often.
*  There's a lot of Brown House kicks land in the back of the head.
*  They come off a lot?
*  Yeah, because especially if you, like say, if a person is standing orthodox and you're
*  standing orthodox and you throw a high kick and you go over his shoulder, you're hitting
*  him right here, right behind the head.
*  You know how to do that kick?
*  Yeah.
*  I saw you kicking the bag.
*  I was like, damn, I knew you was going to do this.
*  I didn't know you could kick like that.
*  Yeah, that's what I used to do.
*  I was a Taekwondo guy.
*  That's how I started.
*  I call it take your dope.
*  Take your dope?
*  Yeah.
*  It's not good for, it's good for learning how to kick.
*  That's what it's good for.
*  It's not good for learning how to fight.
*  You don't think it's good for MMA?
*  It's good if you know all the other things.
*  But you have to know all the other things.
*  There's no one from Taekwondo that's just going to go into MMA and dominate.
*  Well, I think Anthony Pettis.
*  Right, but he's got great jiu-jitsu, great boxing.
*  I think he did Muay Thai with it.
*  Great low kicks.
*  Did he do Muay Thai with it?
*  Pettis could do anything.
*  He does everything.
*  That guy's a beast, too.
*  He's a beast.
*  That Showtime kick where he fought Henderson and bounced off the cage to this day.
*  Bro.
*  Highlight reels forever.
*  That's like MMA, that's like some Tekken shit.
*  You know what my dream was?
*  I was training for it one time, but I never had the balls to pull it off.
*  I always wanted to do the all you could, the jump uppercut.
*  I was training for this shit and calling them like, man, shit your ass down.
*  That's hilarious.
*  I was going to pull it off in Pride one day, but when the fight came, I just didn't have
*  the balls.
*  So that's why I get jealous of guys that can do that shit, that can pull it off in fights,
*  that could be themselves.
*  Because when I fight, I'm not myself.
*  I'm not the same person that trained.
*  If you come see me train, even when I was champion, best in the world, at one time I
*  was best in the world.
*  I was fucking the first unified champion of fucking MMA before Anderson Silva did it.
*  In my mind, I was the best in the fucking universe.
*  And when I train, you come to the gym, I look like shit, getting the dog shit kicked out
*  of me all over the fucking gym.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  How come?
*  When I fight, I think Rampage comes out.
*  He's just my alter ego or something.
*  But sometimes he don't show up, Joe.
*  It's the weirdest thing.
*  And I'm not.
*  It's me out there fighting.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I like to joke around and laugh.
*  I like to say I'm a comedian pretending to be a fighter.
*  So I'm out there and one time I noticed I wasn't howling before the fight.
*  And the guy that's walking me out to the fight, he dropped something.
*  And I bent down to help him pick it up.
*  I was like, Rampage would never do that.
*  That's when I knew.
*  I was like, he is not here.
*  I hope he shows up when I get in the fucking cage.
*  Roy Jones Jr. said he had something like that too.
*  He called it RJ.
*  He goes, this is Roy Jones.
*  He goes, when RJ comes out, everybody's in trouble.
*  Yeah.
*  He was on the next level too.
*  Oh, man.
*  I don't know what that is though.
*  I don't know what happens.
*  I know in my locker room I'm joking up to five minutes before the fight.
*  And then when I start howling and stuff, I'm like, oh shit, Rampage is here.
*  My team, they knew it.
*  They just always say, oh, there you go.
*  I remember hearing them say it.
*  It must be crazy for them to watch you spar and lose in the gym and not look good,
*  but know that you're just working hard.
*  As long as you're in shape, once you get in there, the real Rampage comes out.
*  Yeah.
*  One of my coaches said that he knows people that's really good in the gym,
*  but then when they get down in the lights with the pressure, they don't perform.
*  It's way better to be the other way.
*  Look bad in the gym, good in the fights.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I mean, there's also like people put themselves in positions in the gym
*  because they want to work hard, so they put themselves in bad positions all the time
*  that you would never allow yourself to get into in a fight.
*  I do that with the jujitsu because I never really liked jujitsu a whole lot,
*  and it was like my worst thing, so I used to just start rolling with myself in guillotine chokes
*  or get put in bad positions.
*  Just to fight out of things all the time?
*  Yeah, and I wouldn't tell my sparring partner what I was doing.
*  Oh, you just let them get you in there?
*  I let them get me and stuff, and I try to work my way out.
*  That's why I've always, I've only been submitted like two times with rear neck chokes.
*  I just, those are my kryptonite.
*  Sakuraba got me.
*  Who else got you other than Sakuraba?
*  And John Jones.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  You know, I didn't train with tall jujitsu guys for him.
*  I had a tall guy to spar with, but I didn't have anybody long and lengthened like that,
*  and I didn't think they would make a difference, but after the fight, I was like, fuck, yeah.
*  It makes a difference on the ground for sure
*  because they can secure chokes from places that you just can't get to.
*  Training for that guy was like the hardest training camp.
*  It was the hardest thing.
*  I remember my coaches, I just listed my coach.
*  I don't watch the fights.
*  They was like, if he turns south, Paul, he's going to throw this kick.
*  If he do this, he's going to do that.
*  Had to train for the bleep kick, for the spinning elbows.
*  That was the hardest motherfucking training camp.
*  For him, it was, I'm having a brain fart, the Brazilian guy, the karate guy, karate kid.
*  The yodo?
*  Oh my God.
*  That training camp was so hard too.
*  Training for a karate guy.
*  He's southpaw too.
*  Oh, he was so good too.
*  In his prime, the yodo machita was a beast, man.
*  Yeah.
*  But I had to bring in karate guys.
*  We brought in this karate coach, and I'm bad with names, and he was in that movie League
*  of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
*  Oh, okay.
*  He was a karate guy, and I was with those managers from the UK, so they knew him.
*  Oh, the Wolf Slayer?
*  Yeah, and they brought that guy in.
*  He was getting mad when I was beating up the karate guys.
*  I was like, this is supposed to be my coach.
*  But he getting mad when he brought his karate guys.
*  Then the first day it was fucking me up, but then I learned, and I saw him fucking up the
*  karate guys.
*  He was getting mad at me.
*  I'm like, man, you my coach.
*  That's crazy.
*  Why was he getting mad?
*  I think because it was his-
*  He was loyal to karate?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, no.
*  That's crazy how-
*  That's not a good coach.
*  Bro, martial artists have big egos, bro.
*  They do.
*  Huge, huge egos.
*  Yeah.
*  They get real loyal to their particular style.
*  One of the things that would drive me crazy when I would watch young guys is there was
*  this guy that we were working with back in the day that was a black belt in jujitsu, and
*  he had this Muay Thai coach.
*  His Muay Thai coach had him convinced that he's a dangerous Muay Thai fighter, just dangerous.
*  You're going to fight.
*  You're going to stand up.
*  I remember they were asking him before the fight, is he ready?
*  How's he feeling?
*  He goes, he's Bangkok ready.
*  He's Bangkok ready.
*  This motherfucker better shoot for doubles and take people down and strangle them.
*  Stop all this kickboxing.
*  You're not a kickboxer.
*  I'd watch the dude hit the bag, and I'd go, please take that guy down.
*  You don't have any power.
*  Don't listen to this guy, man.
*  You're fighting guys that are real strikers.
*  You can't be striking with a real striker.
*  You're thinking you're striking because you're striking in the gym with guys and you're doing
*  okay.
*  Real strikers are different, man.
*  These guys in the gym are not trying to kill you.
*  Right.
*  Sometimes they let you, you know, they don't want to, especially if they're getting paid.
*  Exactly.
*  Well, they're also sparring.
*  They're not fighting.
*  There's just a fucking giant difference, man, when someone's setting something up and they're
*  just looking to drop, and you don't even know what it is.
*  There's so many guys that get delusional because they're good at one thing.
*  They're good at one thing and they think that they know how to fight.
*  One of Eddie Bravo's black belts was he was going to do MMA.
*  He said, I'm thinking of doing MMA.
*  I go, how much training are you doing striking?
*  Like, not much.
*  I'm just going to take him to the ground.
*  I go, listen to me.
*  I go, you know how good you are on the ground?
*  There's guys that are that good at stand up.
*  You know how you can just play with some dude who's a white belt on the ground?
*  There's dudes that they get in front of you.
*  You can't do a damn thing about it and they're going to be hitting you.
*  That's the difference.
*  The difference is if you take a guy down, you get him in an arm bar.
*  He's tapped and that's the end of it.
*  This is not that.
*  This is you getting separated from your fucking consciousness and getting punted in the head
*  by a leg.
*  A leg.
*  I mean, you're fighting Muay Thai guys.
*  He went up getting fucked up and that was his only fight.
*  I was telling him, don't do that again.
*  You can't disrespect that.
*  You can't think that just because you're good at this one thing, you're going to be good
*  at everything.
*  But guys think that, which is one of the things I'm sure you've seen this, a lot of real good
*  kickboxers, they don't like to roll.
*  They don't like to roll because they don't do good at rolling.
*  They want to spar because they want to hit the mitts.
*  They want to hit the pads.
*  They feel good.
*  They throw those pads.
*  They look good hitting those pads like yeah.
*  But you got to do what you shit at though.
*  You got to do it.
*  But that's the difference in you, who became a champion, and some guys who just have big
*  egos and they're fragile because you were willing to look like shit in training.
*  You were just training.
*  It was just training.
*  And then once you fought, you fought great.
*  But it's like you got to be able to look like shit in training.
*  And if you're going to get good at jujitsu, guess what?
*  There's only one way.
*  You got to roll with guys who know how to strangle you because you got to figure out
*  how to defend yourself.
*  If you don't do that, you're never going to learn.
*  And there's guys that were like real good fighters that just never learned that aspect
*  of the game and they just always were limited.
*  They always had a ceiling on how far they could progress.
*  I surprised a lot of people with my jujitsu.
*  Because I didn't like it and I never showed it, people thought I didn't know it.
*  When I fought Dan Henderson, it kind of showed a little bit.
*  But what helped me out is, you know, Mayhem Miller.
*  He he was my buddy.
*  We was like brothers.
*  Mayhem was good.
*  Yeah, he was good. He was my training partner.
*  Yeah. And he went to train with Dan Henderson for that fight.
*  Oh, no shit. Yeah.
*  And and so Dan Henderson
*  ground game was like Mayhem's
*  and Mayhem used to dominate me on the ground.
*  So so Dan Henderson was fighting like, I'm like, I've seen this before.
*  And he's not as good as Mayhem at it.
*  So that helped me.
*  My buddy going training.
*  Mayhem was fucking good on the ground, man.
*  I remember Mayhem's finest performance was against Sakuraba.
*  When Mayhem, he beat the shit out of Sakuraba.
*  And I remember watching that fight and I had a phone call with him.
*  We talked on the phone.
*  I was like, dude, you're on it right now.
*  Like you are right now.
*  You're world class.
*  Like, just keep your shit together.
*  And you could be you could be like an elite fighter,
*  like a world championship caliber.
*  See if you can find Jason Mayhem Miller versus Sakuraba.
*  I never saw I don't think I ever saw maybe I saw years ago.
*  But that guy's next.
*  His next level. Next level.
*  Very high level. Very high level.
*  But, you know, he was just whatever.
*  Just couldn't put it all together in the best fights.
*  You know, the Michael Bissping fight, George St. Pierre.
*  You know, there was guys that knew how to beat him.
*  But this and this was Mayhem focused in shape training,
*  like what full skill set.
*  And this was when Sakuraba was at the top.
*  He's been the great.
*  Oh, dude, Sakuraba was still very good.
*  I mean, he was a little past that now.
*  Like, I think he'd already got KO'd by a couple of guys.
*  But he was still Sakuraba.
*  This is not an old Sakuraba.
*  I mean, he had his legs taped up like a mummy by then.
*  Yeah. I saw Sakuraba a couple of weeks ago in Japan.
*  Yeah, he was Sakuraba in his day.
*  Man, I remember when he knocked out where he submitted Conan Silvera
*  and everybody was like, what?
*  He submitted a Jujitsu black belt.
*  Yeah, he's good. He's tricky.
*  He don't stop. He goes from one submission to the next.
*  That's how he got me.
*  So this is Jason.
*  Like Sakuraba is going for a leg lock and Jason defends.
*  Jason was so good on the ground.
*  Like, good luck catching him with something.
*  He won't tap anyway.
*  Jason won't tap even if even if you got a fight in a week.
*  You give him an arm bar, he won't tap.
*  Break his arm. He won't give a fuck.
*  He was a wild dude, man.
*  He was a wild dude.
*  And this is like a dominant performance over a legend.
*  Gives a peace sign to the fucking camera.
*  Oh, once you got that right, wrist tie.
*  This was in Pride. Yeah.
*  I don't know why I didn't see this one.
*  Oh, no, it was dream.
*  Oh, that's what it was.
*  Yes, this is post Pride.
*  What year was this? Does it say?
*  He now he's fucking Sakuraba.
*  Oh, he fucked him up, dude.
*  It was a complete domination.
*  2010. Yeah.
*  So this is like Sakuraba had already been beaten up by a bunch of guys.
*  And then he gets him on Triangle.
*  Bro, this is it right here.
*  Yep. And the first round.
*  Yeah. Look at that.
*  Tapping mayhem.
*  I can believe Sakuraba tapped.
*  Yeah. You go to sleep.
*  I think he did go to sleep.
*  Did you know Sakuraba is a fucking chain smoker?
*  I heard. They're crazy.
*  Crazy, bro. How?
*  I don't know how he how I don't know how he has the fucking cardio.
*  Imagine the cardio you have if he didn't chain smoke.
*  Do you remember the fight when it went?
*  What was it? Was it Horace Gracie?
*  And they they took the time limit out. Yeah.
*  That's because they knew he was a smoker.
*  Really? So they just wanted to drag it out.
*  Yeah, because they thought that he's going to get tired.
*  He's going to want a cigarette.
*  Man, I did a movie with him in Japan and he had to take a smoke break every five minutes.
*  Wow. Every five minutes, bro.
*  Wow. Every five minutes.
*  I'm not over exaggerating.
*  Was this like when he was in training back then?
*  He smoked that much.
*  Yeah, it was like it was like a couple of years after I fought him,
*  maybe like a year or two after I fought him.
*  He was how does he now fuck his lungs up?
*  But I think I think it's mental.
*  I think see, I think a lot of things is mental.
*  I believe in the power of the mind.
*  I used to have a really strong mind back in the day.
*  Like, remember, I told you about the force kicking me the calf kick.
*  Yeah. Bro, my mom was so strong back then.
*  I healed. I healed my leg up in between rounds.
*  She was in pain, but I was mentally strong.
*  And I also think that's why I lost that fight, because I had the manager at the time that I wasn't.
*  I didn't trust him anymore.
*  And I remember him saying, like, if Rampage loses his fight, I'm going to retire.
*  And I was I had been trying to fire him a couple of times,
*  but he got put on the hard strings every time.
*  So I was thinking, I think subconscious in the back of my mind, I lost that fight.
*  You say you think maybe if I lose this fight, I can get rid of this guy
*  in the back of my mind.
*  But I really wanted to win because I was champion.
*  But you were torn. Yeah.
*  But in the back of my mind.
*  But my mind was strong to heal my leg up where I could go.
*  I couldn't feel pain. It was really my leg was really fucked.
*  That fight. I still think I won that fight when I went back and watched it.
*  I think I lost two rounds and I won three.
*  And I lost my belt. I'd have to watch it again.
*  But I feel like it was a very close fight.
*  I remember that. I remember being a close fight.
*  I remember I slammed him.
*  I think I dropped him a couple of times.
*  And I think the only thing he did was really like hurt hurt my leg.
*  And like the first round is the second round.
*  But I think I won the last three.
*  But I remember watching it again because, you know, I'm honest about it.
*  When I fought
*  Ninja at the time, I thought he won.
*  I told him right then and there.
*  I was like, oh, I thought I thought he won.
*  I thought I got my ass kicked, but they gave me the decision.
*  I'm honest about this.
*  You said that Ninja got hurt in training.
*  Yeah, that's what that's what the word around a campfire because, you know,
*  shoebox, they they spar hard, hard.
*  And and you heard you haven't heard about him fighting in a long time.
*  He retired a long time.
*  I already had some sort of brain bleed.
*  Yeah, they get knocked out a lot and sparring.
*  Yeah, I heard some some other people was training there with them.
*  So they go for that showgun and Vandeley.
*  They fought for a puppy because
*  Shogun had some pit bull puppies and Vandeley wanted one.
*  And he was offering to sell it to him.
*  He said, let's fight for it.
*  And he Vandeley KO'd him and took the puppy.
*  I believe it. I believe it, too.
*  I believe it because those apparently those guys knocked each other out a lot.
*  They're like savages in the Maybro.
*  I think they just didn't understand that you it's like a punch card.
*  You only have so many holes.
*  You can punch in that card and then that's it.
*  And if you're sparring like that, you're KO'ing each other.
*  And then you're back in the gym on Monday.
*  Like, that's nuts.
*  Yeah, because because normally when you get knocked out,
*  well, you got to take 30 days off.
*  You should take a long time off more than 30 days.
*  Yeah, a long time.
*  Like Justin Gaethje said, he's going to take six months off
*  and not do anything for six months after that.
*  Max Holloway fight. He's not even going to train.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, I'm sure he's probably training, probably working out a little bit.
*  But he's not going to do any sparring.
*  I think that's the most iconic knockout in MMA ever, ever.
*  One second to go in a five round fight that he was dominating
*  and a five round fight where a lot of people thought Max was outgunned.
*  I thought Max was I thought Max was winning.
*  He was winning. But I mean, outgunned, like going into the fight.
*  Justin Gaethje is a big KO artist.
*  He just got done head kicking Dustin Poirier.
*  He's a 50 fiver.
*  Max had lost a few times at 45 to Volkanovsky,
*  and everybody was thinking he was past his prime.
*  And then Max just puts on a fucking performance of a lifetime.
*  But I always knew Max boxing was next level, though. Next level.
*  Well, his heart and mind is next level, too.
*  And people also forget Max is only 32.
*  He's just been in the UFC for so long.
*  His first fight in the UFC was 20 years old.
*  Yeah, I didn't know he was that young.
*  I think his first fight was Conor McGregor.
*  Was it? Yes, I think so.
*  So we go to Max Holloway's career record.
*  Did he beat Conor? No, no, he lost a decision.
*  He was the only guy to survive in the early days of Conor
*  when Conor was just flatlining everybody.
*  This is 145 Conor.
*  No first fight was against Dustin Poirier.
*  Oh, that's right. He got arm barred against Dustin.
*  Yeah, Dustin got him in an arm bar.
*  And then the second fight was Conor, correct?
*  No, it was like his sixth fight, actually. Really?
*  Yeah. No shit.
*  Wow. And then he OK.
*  Wow. He had so many fights, man. That crazy.
*  So he lost to Dustin Poirier.
*  That's his 2012.
*  And then Pat Schilling, he wins.
*  Justin Lawrence wins.
*  Leonard Garcia, Leonard Garcia.
*  I forgot about Leonard. Shout out to Leonard.
*  And then he loses Dennis Bermudez.
*  I forgot about Dennis, too.
*  And then he lost to Conor.
*  Maybe that kid was 20 years old at that time,
*  which is wild, man. Yeah.
*  Way back in 2013.
*  And then he goes on a run.
*  And then his run like look at his win streak after that Conor McGregor fight.
*  I mean, that is a crazy win streak.
*  Charles Olivera, Anthony Pettis, Jose Aldo, twice Ortega.
*  Fucking crazy.
*  And then he fought Dustin again at lightweight.
*  He tried to fight for the interim UFC lightweight title,
*  but he didn't really gain weight the correct way.
*  And he talked about that.
*  He said he had like a little muffin top on the top of his shorts.
*  You know, and so then loses to Volkonovsky a couple of times,
*  beats Arnold Allen, who's really fucking good.
*  And a lot of people still like that.
*  He knocks out the Korean zombie and people like, hmm, maybe.
*  And then the Justin Gates, you want people like, oh, shit, we forgot.
*  We forgot. Max is the man.
*  And he's such a nice guy. Nice guy.
*  Great. Nice guy. Great dude.
*  Yeah, I want to ask you who you think has like is the most well
*  rounded in MMA right now, like this good at like three or more.
*  That's a good question.
*  That's a good question.
*  It's hard to say.
*  You know, it's hard to say.
*  Might be Sean O'Malley.
*  Sean O'Malley is not the best wrestler, but damn, his takedown defense
*  is fucking good because he survived against Al Jermain, you know,
*  I mean, Al Jermain couldn't take him down.
*  He can knock anybody out with one shot. Yeah. Yeah.
*  He submitted Takenori Gomi in a jujitsu match.
*  His jujitsu is real.
*  Like Sean can do everything.
*  And he's just relentless, tireless worker.
*  He's a star superstar.
*  Hey, how you seen how you seen those those posts that was his name?
*  How you say his name? Mo Hab.
*  What's that name? How you say his name? Which one?
*  The guy I thought he was Mexican.
*  Marab. Yeah, Marab.
*  Marab Davish-Williams. Yeah, I thought he was Mexican when I first met.
*  You see his post he do about Sean O'Malley?
*  Oh, yeah, he's trying to get him to fight him.
*  But have you seen his post? His recent ones?
*  Man, he got he got somebody that looks like Sean O'Malley.
*  He'd be doing crazy shit to that motherfucker.
*  That dude was funny, bro.
*  You know, I like funny shit, man. Yeah.
*  Marab's funny. Yeah. Marab is an animal, man.
*  What he did to Henry Cejudo, I was like, I can't even believe this is happening.
*  I was there. When he carried him, when he picked him up and then he's like,
*  like stuck his tongue out and he walked over towards where the UFC people were
*  and then slammed him, slammed Henry Cejudo, Olympic gold medalist.
*  Who the fuck does that?
*  Bro, I'm conflicted for that fight, because, you know, F3 sponsors
*  Henry, right? That is crazy.
*  So we brought him over to Zuckerberg. That's right, bro.
*  I think that was was that at the apex?
*  No, that was in Anaheim. That's right.
*  I was there in the crowd.
*  I mean, then he had him at a ten finger guillotine.
*  Dude, Marab is a scary character because that motherfucker never gets tired.
*  And his heart is crazy.
*  You ever see his fight with Marlon Marais?
*  No, Marlon Marais had him dead to rights.
*  He had him out. I mean, he was battering him.
*  And Marlon is the best guy who never won a title in the UFC.
*  He was so good, but he would fold.
*  Something would happen. He would fold up like any when he started
*  getting KO'd a few times.
*  It all went away and he fell apart. He's a cop now in Florida.
*  But Marlon, in that fight, he had Marab in all kinds of trouble.
*  And Marab just wouldn't stop.
*  He got a big heart. Oh, his heart is enormous, man.
*  It's he's unstoppable.
*  Like his mind is unstoppable. I mean, you can beat him.
*  Ray Borg submitted him like way back in the day.
*  Got him in a guillotine.
*  But guys, you know that that he just keeps getting better, too.
*  Marab, every time he fights, he gets better.
*  You think he's going to beat him?
*  He's the worst matchup for Sean, the worst matchup on paper for Sean
*  in that division is Marab.
*  Because if you would say if you have a chance to beat Sean,
*  how would you beat him? You got to take him down.
*  Right. I would imagine.
*  I don't think there's anybody in that 135 pound division
*  that can deal with that height, that length, KO power, footwork and movement.
*  What he did to Cheeto, I was shocked.
*  I was shocked because the first fight, you know, Cheeto beat him.
*  He kicked his leg and fucked him up and got him down.
*  But in the second fight, Cheeto didn't have a chance.
*  Now, Cheeto's a beast. He's a beast.
*  He's a beast.
*  And he hurt him real bad in like the last couple seconds of the fight.
*  He hit him with a liver punch.
*  He hit him with a Cheeto, hit him with a nasty left hook to the liver.
*  And man, if he landed that fight early in the fight
*  or landed that punch rather early in the fight, who knows?
*  But Sean is so good everywhere.
*  He's so good. And you can't you can't corner that guy.
*  He's just moving.
*  You know, you can't like corral him.
*  He's just constantly like and in the consequences of moving in
*  and like with what Al Jame did, he just got a little rushed.
*  He rushed in on it. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Right. Yeah.
*  You can't rush on that guy.
*  I wonder what Al Jame was thinking.
*  And he says he kicked himself out of that.
*  I think he just got just he just rushed it.
*  He just tried to close the gap.
*  He wanted to get a hold of him, you know, and he just tried to rush in.
*  I think Al Jame is better at 145 anyway.
*  I think Al Jame is so big.
*  I was always shocked that he could make 135.
*  He's another guy, right?
*  He would walk around 176, 175 pounds.
*  Like, how how are you losing 40 fucking pounds?
*  I don't know how they doing this.
*  Killing themselves. That's how killing themselves.
*  But when he rehydrated at 35, he was like just ripped,
*  just jacked big muscles, strongest shit in his back control is better
*  than anybody's man.
*  When he took Corey Sandhagen down and strangled him, I was like, oh, my God.
*  Corey's good.
*  You think Al Jame make a comeback? Yes.
*  Yeah, I think you're going to make a comeback.
*  But 45. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Who's the champion? 45 right now?
*  Ilya Toporya. Toporya. Yeah.
*  I don't know a lot of these new fighters.
*  Ilya Toporya is a monster.
*  He's a monster. That dude's good.
*  He's the guy who knocked out Volkanovsky.
*  Oh, yeah, I think I saw that was the same night that
*  Henry and what's called Fault, right? Mm hmm.
*  Yeah. Ilya Toporya is a bad man.
*  That's him right there. Mm hmm.
*  He's a bad man. He's very, very, very good.
*  But I want to see Sean O'Malley versus Corey Sandhagen.
*  That's an interesting fight to me.
*  If he can get past Marab.
*  This is next fight, Marab.
*  What is that? You know, they already got it set.
*  I don't know when that is.
*  I heard rumors that that was going to be at the Sphere,
*  which is in September.
*  But I've also heard rumors of other fights at the Sphere.
*  That one's going to sell out right away.
*  Fuck, yeah. That one's going to be nuts.
*  You got to go to that. I want to go.
*  I heard I heard Dana said that he only going to do one and done there.
*  Yeah, you got to go to that one.
*  I would love to go to that one. Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's going to sell out right away.
*  I'd be trying to ask Tiki to give me tickets sometimes.
*  That, you know, help me out.
*  Bro, I got you. You got me?
*  I got you for that. Let's go. Let's go.
*  Come on, Ravage. You got to be there for that.
*  I would love to be there for that. Yeah, man.
*  You got to be there for that.
*  The UFC doesn't hook you up with tickets?
*  No, you don't. That's ridiculous.
*  You're a former champion.
*  You should get tickets for the rest of your fucking life.
*  If I was running the UFC, no offense to the people that are champions.
*  You get tickets. You know, I fucked up my relationship with the UFC
*  by doing that fucking movie over that Rashad fight.
*  What was the movie? 18.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  That's when that's when I fucked up my relationship with Dana and everybody.
*  But it was it was the hardest decision of my my life.
*  I lost money doing a movie, but but I'm not really fueled by money.
*  I'm not, you know, I don't love money, but I always wanted to do it.
*  It just came at a bad time.
*  The thing about doing a movie, though, is that if that takes off,
*  then you're the rock.
*  You know, who fucking knows you're John Cena? Who knows?
*  There's a lot of guys that have become action movie stars.
*  Look at Randy. He did The Expendables with Sylvester Stallone.
*  Crazy. You get a real career in the movies and you fight forever.
*  Right. Exactly. And some certain things like that.
*  But, you know, the UFC, their business, the business is making fights.
*  I understand. You know, I understand.
*  I understand Dana's point, you know, because I didn't sign a bout agreement.
*  That's the only thing that saved me.
*  But, you know, it was supposed to be in my hometown.
*  It was big. We just come up there.
*  Ultimate Fighters, you know, the episode that season broke records.
*  Yeah. So I understand.
*  But it was just it was just so hard for me to turn down that that that movie.
*  And I try to keep my word when I get my word that I'm going to do something.
*  And I was already dedicated to that project, even when John
*  John Singleton was attached to it.
*  And I was like, you know, this is what I'm going to do.
*  Yeah. It's tough call.
*  Yeah. When you were on the Ultimate Fighter with Rashad and you broke that door,
*  I was like, they need to get new contractors.
*  That's the cheapest fucking door I've ever seen in my life.
*  Bro, whether you know it or not, most doors inside your house look like that.
*  Yeah, they're bullshit.
*  Bullshit. I had no idea.
*  But I was glad it was because my dumb ass.
*  I lost my temper and I headbutted it.
*  Bro, I'm still embarrassed about that.
*  Oh, really? That's that's one.
*  That's one of my most embarrassing, embarrassing TV moments.
*  Just because you lost your temper.
*  Yeah, I hate I hate to lose my temper.
*  I hate it. And it's so embarrassing.
*  I several like relationships, friendships when I lose it.
*  I just get embarrassed.
*  And that's why I never post that shit on my on my social media.
*  This is embarrassing. But fuck, fans love that shit.
*  They loved you tearing apart a door.
*  Yeah. And they love you and Rashad.
*  Like you a bitch. Treat me like a bitch.
*  You a bitch. Treat me like a bitch.
*  I hated him, bro.
*  I hated I hated Rashad.
*  I hated it. Like you told me earlier, the mushrooms, it changed.
*  He's a totally different person. He's a different human being.
*  He's likable now.
*  He's very like he's a sweetheart.
*  I still want to knock him out, though.
*  Who do you want to knock out more, him or Shannon?
*  Shannon. Yeah.
*  He keeps calling you a pie.
*  Yeah. Who calls people pies?
*  Some room, that guy. He's fun, man.
*  Bro, he he put my my my face.
*  Yeah, he put my face over fat women's bodies
*  and he keep fat shaming me.
*  And he's fatter than me right now.
*  I'm like, what?
*  Why are you so delusional, bro?
*  You're not ripped no more.
*  Did you ever see where he was on a boat and Vladimir Klitschko
*  was out there paddleboard?
*  He went fuck with it when he was on the boat and made him fall off the paddleboard.
*  He's a fucking drone.
*  He showed up while he was eating a poured water.
*  His face are eating his food.
*  When you eat, we eat.
*  Yeah. So look at Shannon.
*  Ah.
*  Everywhere you go, I go.
*  Huh? Huh?
*  Yeah, you think it's funny.
*  You think it's funny now.
*  You think it's funny.
*  Now you see me. I'm everywhere, baby.
*  This doesn't seem like a guy to joke around like that, though.
*  No. Well, find the one where he finds him eating
*  because because there's like he was doing everything he could to get that fight
*  because he fought his brother.
*  Right. His brother stopped Shannon, I think.
*  Oh, did these two? They didn't.
*  No. So he sits down while he's eating.
*  Would you eat? I eat.
*  I'm sorry. His food in his food.
*  He's helping them eat.
*  Could you have some food here?
*  Have a glass of water.
*  Then he pours the water on his head.
*  He's.
*  He can sell a fight, though, that month.
*  Oh, yeah. Well, that shit sold fights, man.
*  Look, and Shannon in his day was a dangerous boxer.
*  He was a very, very good heavyweight boxer in his day.
*  He showed up at the gym when Klitschko was sparring.
*  He showed up everywhere.
*  I mean, he was the bane of Klitschko's existence.
*  Yeah. Kind of amazing that fight never happened.
*  I thought I didn't know which one it was.
*  I thought it was that fight that was his brother. Right.
*  I didn't know. I thought Shannon fought Lennox Lewis and had a great show and to
*  He hurt Lennox at one point.
*  I'm innocent. His ass at a hospital.
*  Did he beat him bad?
*  He beat him bad in that fight.
*  Lennox was a monster in his time, and Lennox won the greatest of all time.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  I love to see Lennox against any of these guys today.
*  Man, I was in Saudi Arabia for that Tyson
*  new fight.
*  And we was meeting with the was the was his name, Turk, the prince.
*  And he asked, he had all the fighters that they invited.
*  They had us all in the room.
*  And they were talking about doing like the legends boxing.
*  And he asked who wanted to fight Lennox Lewis.
*  Nobody said that. I raised my motherfucking hand.
*  And I was like, yeah, I fight him.
*  And Lennox came over there, came to me and like, checked me out
*  and looked at me and stuff like that.
*  Like, yeah, shit, they paying big money.
*  I want a box. I've been asking the box for years.
*  Nobody want to fight.
*  So I thought they was going to put it together.
*  And then Shannon said, oh, Saudi Arabia want us to fight.
*  And they never put their fight together.
*  I know that they were talking about having Lennox fight Mike Tyson.
*  It was right around the time after Mike Tyson fought Roy Jones Jr.
*  And they were talking about making that.
*  But it didn't come to fruition.
*  I think Lennox really don't want to fight. Yeah.
*  I just thought that's what that's the feeling that I got.
*  But I think Lennox would have fought me.
*  It'd be a good fight for him.
*  Well, that's a you know, it's that's a thing like you'd have to wonder,
*  is Lennox working out at all?
*  He looked like he was in good shape.
*  He didn't look like overweight or anything.
*  Right. It's not overweight.
*  But is he working out? Like, I don't even know.
*  You know, at least before Mike Tyson fought Roy Jones,
*  you got to see all that footage of him training like, OK, Mike looks good.
*  Like you could sell that.
*  But if you don't, you just decide to start working out again at 50, whatever he is.
*  How old is he? I don't know how old he is.
*  I hope Lennox is older than me.
*  I'm 56. I think Lennox is like 58.
*  You 56, 56 years old.
*  Ten years old. Yeah.
*  Damn.
*  And he's older than you.
*  Yep. He should be fighting.
*  They shouldn't. You don't think they should be fighting past 50.
*  It's I mean, I think a person, again, just like I think you should be able to do
*  slap fighting, you should be able to ride bulls, do whatever the fuck you want.
*  But over like like Mike Tyson fighting fighting.
*  I don't think you should be able to stop a person from doing it.
*  I think if they pass medicals, if they want to look, fighting is bad for everybody.
*  It's bad for 20 year olds.
*  It's bad for 58 year olds.
*  You know, I just feel like.
*  You should be able to do whatever you want to do.
*  I mean, look, look, riding bulls is always bad.
*  It's always bad, but yet bull riding is legal.
*  You know, yeah, this BMX flips, those dudes do those flips.
*  They paralyze themselves all the time.
*  Skateboarders, they fall down, break every fucking bone, their body, get
*  horrible head trauma.
*  That's legal.
*  I feel like you should be able to fight.
*  If you if you're an adult human being and you make a decision
*  and you pass the medicals, they look at you, they say, yeah,
*  he doesn't have brain problems, it doesn't have heart problems.
*  Let them fight.
*  They should fight people closer to their same age, though.
*  Yeah, that's the Jake Paul thing is kind of crazy.
*  You know, Mike is 50.
*  He just turned 58 yesterday.
*  Yeah. So Mike is going to be 58.
*  Jake is going to be 28.
*  Jake's active.
*  You know, I mean, you see Mike run.
*  It doesn't look like his knees are in good shape.
*  No, for real. I haven't seen it doesn't look good.
*  I just see him hitting pads.
*  He's done some sprints and stuff and people look at it and go,
*  but I'm going to tell you something.
*  What I'll do respect, Mike Tyson just look like
*  his body type is awkward anyway.
*  Yeah, the way he moves.
*  So that might just be him.
*  Have you ever seen him dance?
*  Yeah, he does. It's awkward. Yeah.
*  So so I assume that maybe part of him running like this, just his body
*  body mechanics, he's just he's just like an awkward.
*  Perhaps, but is also 58, you know,
*  and then all the punishment of all those years, you know,
*  I know he's had back problems and neck problems.
*  I believe he's had neck surgery.
*  You know, 58 is 58.
*  There's no if hands or butts.
*  But then again, he's doing stem cells, peptides.
*  I would assume they let him do hormones, everything he wants.
*  I mean, there's no way they're going to ask him to be clean at 58 years old.
*  But that's a dream fight to fight Mike Tyson, though.
*  This is what Lennox Lewis said after the USIC.
*  He says, do Huckster still try to entice Lewis back of the ring?
*  So yeah, they do.
*  But as my friend says, I ain't no fool.
*  Hopefully that means a rejection of any stunt of a comeback
*  for an undisputed championship as a as significant as Lewis
*  and disputed champion, rather as significant as Lewis.
*  He laughs.
*  I was seeing if I could catch you out there for me.
*  Money talks, bullshit walks.
*  Does that mean that we consider an astronomical offer to make a return?
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  I'd 100 percent consider it.
*  Lewis is still smiling when I ask if he works out regularly.
*  Yes, I do. I ran five miles this morning.
*  I swam a couple of lengths, 100 meters.
*  Then I woke up and took a shower.
*  Oh, you're joking.
*  He looked like he's still trained, though, when I saw him.
*  Yeah, I didn't see him with his shirt off or anything.
*  But he, you know, if I.
*  It's definitely not fat. No, no.
*  He looks he looks good for his age.
*  How old is Lennox? 58.
*  Yeah. So it's like same age as Tyson.
*  Yeah, it's like when you get to that age, why?
*  Yeah, because if you get hurt bad at 58, you don't really recover.
*  You know, if you watch a guy, did you watch a vendor versus Vitor?
*  That was sad. Yeah, that was sad.
*  And that's the same kind of age.
*  Like, I think Evander was 59 during that fight and maybe 58.
*  But Vitor just beat the shit.
*  Did you feel bad for Evander? Yeah.
*  Did you want to like give Vitor a little talking to?
*  No, no, because if Evander could,
*  he would have done that to Vitor if everything was working correctly.
*  I don't even think he took that on a full camp.
*  No, no, it was a short notice because he was supposed to fight somebody else.
*  They pulled out right. Right.
*  But how can a guy like Evander at 58, 59 years old, whatever he is,
*  fight a short and didn't look good.
*  It's like Vitor heard him to the body with that left hand.
*  You know, boxers, they don't respect MMA fighters.
*  You better respect Vitor.
*  And he he was a boxer first, wasn't it?
*  Well, he had good hands.
*  I mean, he wasn't necessarily a boxer,
*  but he was a jujitsu black belt under Carlson Gracie.
*  When I first started training in 96, I started at Carlson Gracie's place.
*  And that was when Vitor was he fought for his first time.
*  He fought John Hess in Hawaii and he fucked John Hess up.
*  John Hess was this big, tall dude.
*  He had some crazy system.
*  I think he called it SAFTA.
*  It was like a lot of nut punches and eye pokes.
*  And he was a kind of a dirty fighter, like a dangerous, mean dude.
*  And Vitor just beat the fucking shit out of him.
*  And he was 19. He was so fast.
*  He was like 200 pounds.
*  He wasn't a big guy.
*  And see if you can find that Vitor Belfort versus John Hess.
*  So this is Vitor's debut.
*  This was happening while I was training at that academy.
*  And the UFC fight was in the UFC.
*  No, this was before the UFC.
*  And so this was 96 ish somewhere around there.
*  And then in 97, the first time Vitor fought in the UFC was the first time I worked for the USA.
*  That was UFC 12.
*  Did he fight Van Oley?
*  No, he fought Scott Ferozo and this is Vitor.
*  See, look at this dude fighting with pants on.
*  Oh, my God. Oh, bro.
*  Look at this. Why would the referee? Oh, my God.
*  There's no referees didn't do jack shit.
*  Look at the referees are right in.
*  Pull it back to the beginning.
*  So you see the beginning of the fight.
*  That's all it showed.
*  That's all it showed. Show it again.
*  He was a fucking kid. Here it is.
*  So he still has a bad footage.
*  So he stormed across the fucking ring and just teed off on that dude.
*  So I was training at Carlson Gracie's place.
*  I was learning jujitsu.
*  I was a white belt in 96 and Vitor was making his UFC debut.
*  And I remember everybody thought, like, oh, he's a black belt under Carlson Gracie.
*  This is going to be a jujitsu match here.
*  This is like real shitty footage of it.
*  So he grabbed John Hess.
*  That's a big motherfucker.
*  Huge. John Hess was huge.
*  And Vitor was not big.
*  And Vitor just dragged him to the ground and beat the fuck out of it.
*  Look how thin he is back then, too.
*  Look how fast he's thrown. Oh, my God.
*  His hand speed's insane.
*  Bro, that looks like a murder.
*  It looks like I just witnessed a murder.
*  He basically did.
*  I mean, he could have kept going and he would have been dead.
*  You know, have you seen his son? No.
*  Vitor's son? No.
*  Bro, find Vitor's son hitting the pads.
*  His son is apparently a star football player, like an elite football player.
*  But crazy hand speed.
*  For real? Hitting the pads looks fucking phenomenal.
*  It's wild to see because it's like that's got to be genetic.
*  So here he is.
*  Look at his hand speed.
*  Damn. That's Vitor's son.
*  Kind of keeping his chin a little up in the air and throwing punches.
*  But he's not a fighter, though, huh?
*  No, well, I don't know.
*  I mean, he's sparring.
*  Bro, the kid has crazy hand speed.
*  I mean, you got to think, like with Vitor as your dad,
*  I mean, those genes, that's some real genes, man.
*  Look at him hitting the pads, man.
*  Fucking dudes got hands.
*  Hand speed like wild hand speed.
*  You should let him get out there.
*  Yeah. Look at those fucking combinations, man.
*  Yeah, fuck. Crazy hand speed, bro.
*  But that was Vitor when Vitor was young.
*  So when Vitor fought in 97, I remember we all knew.
*  But we were like, everybody thinks he's a jujitsu guy.
*  And you're going to have to deal with a hail of punches coming from this guy.
*  Remember when he fought Vandalite?
*  That's when he came on my radar.
*  He wore shoes and just went.
*  Apparently he was so scared of Vandalite, he was terrified before that fight.
*  That's what everybody's saying.
*  He was like crying in the locker room, like did not want to fight Vandalite,
*  but just went out there and starched him in like 10 seconds.
*  And just fucked him up. Never gave him a rematch.
*  Fuck that. He ran across the octagon and just blitzed him.
*  Never seen shit like that before.
*  No, it was wild.
*  And look, his sons, look, my son was sparring with Anderson Civil's son
*  a couple of weeks ago and gave me the idea.
*  I said, fuck man, we got fighters now and we all got kids like in their 20s and so
*  we should do a fucking reality show with the fucking kids.
*  Well, how about AJ McKee?
*  Yeah. AJ McKee is good.
*  Next level, bro. He's very good.
*  Very good. Next fucking level, bro.
*  Yeah. And everywhere.
*  He's a guy who's well rounded.
*  But I've been knowing that kid since he was three years old.
*  I knew it already. I'm not even surprised because I used to train him to death.
*  That's what bothers me about other organizations
*  is that a guy as good as AJ McKee doesn't become a household name.
*  Nobody knows who he is.
*  Like that sucks.
*  That's what makes me that's what upsets me when guys wind up going over there.
*  Like, I get it.
*  You know, like Corey Anderson.
*  They didn't want to let him go, bro.
*  They didn't want to let him go. I told his dad, man, get him over to the UFC.
*  But he's under contract.
*  Yeah. And Bellator, they just kept offering him money.
*  They didn't want to let him go because he'll walk a highlight reel.
*  Yeah, he's so good.
*  But it's still not good enough.
*  The Bellator thing, it's just like you can't be famous over there.
*  You can get kind of like Venom got famous.
*  Michael Venom Page got famous from some of the knockouts
*  and some of the things he did over there.
*  But even he like now he's famous is in the UFC.
*  But he's 37 in the UFC.
*  Like I would love to see Michael Venom Page in the UFC at 27.
*  Yeah. Like, good Lord, bro.
*  I'm going to tell you, I can barely go anywhere without guys
*  asking me for a picture and stuff.
*  All right. I left the UFC, went to Bellator now for years.
*  I was in Bellator for years and people come ask me for a picture.
*  They were like, man, I wish you hadn't retired.
*  I'm like, dude, I just fought last week.
*  They have no idea. Bellator do not promote fights.
*  They don't fucking do shit. I don't get it.
*  I don't understand.
*  Nobody knows who's watching. It's unfortunate.
*  It's unfortunate.
*  I mean, I get it that fighters will want to go like the PFL, right?
*  If you win that tournament, you make a million dollars.
*  So Olivier Aubameur, I think he won it twice.
*  So he won two million dollars in the PFL.
*  Nobody watched.
*  Nobody knows who he is.
*  I mean, it's just I mean, people know, but nothing in comparison
*  to like a Dustin Poirier or someone who wins in the UFC.
*  Bro, I'm going to tell you this.
*  If A.J. McKee goes to the UFC, I would I would bet money.
*  I've never bet on fights.
*  I would bet money on him.
*  He'll walk through the whole thing and get the belt easy.
*  How old is A.J. now?
*  He got to be like 26.
*  He's a hold is he? 29.
*  What? Yeah.
*  Damn, I didn't know he that much older than my son.
*  In his fucking prime. He's in his prime.
*  How much longer is his contract over at Bellator?
*  I don't know. Now the Bellator sold the PFL.
*  They're not really they're two different organizations, right?
*  Like one of them they're going to do overseas is Bellator and the PFL.
*  I don't understand that.
*  But I like their belt. So when you when you win that thing,
*  have you seen that belt?
*  The belt's good with the ring.
*  Six fight multi-year contract.
*  And this is 2023.
*  Yeah. Fuck.
*  I wish you would have went to the UFC because that kid.
*  Why did he sign that contract?
*  They must they must up to money.
*  I don't want to put his business out there, but his dad said that A.J.
*  is really successful.
*  And I think they was paying a monthly on top of everything.
*  They did what they had to do to keep that kid there.
*  Well, that's the thing.
*  If you do have a talented guy that has a potential of being a star,
*  you cannot let him go.
*  Well, Bellator lost Michael Chandler.
*  And look what happened. Michael Chandler became a fucking star.
*  Like people don't even know.
*  Michael Chandler fought Eddie Alvarez in some of the craziest fights in Bellator.
*  They're both dropping each other.
*  I mean, wild, wild fights.
*  And no one saw them.
*  You know, no. I mean, some people saw them.
*  I'm exaggerating, obviously.
*  But no one in comparison to like who saw him knock out Dan Hooker
*  or when he knocked out Tony Ferguson.
*  All right. So so.
*  Teach me this. So in Bellator, maybe their views, they get like a million.
*  Do they even? Yeah, they get at least.
*  I got the numbers when I was when I was fighting.
*  I got at least like a million one point five.
*  What would the USC do a free fight?
*  How many million views?
*  That's a good question. I don't know the answer to that.
*  So they got to be getting at least 20 million.
*  If they have a free fight like on ESPN plus, I don't know how many people.
*  I don't even know how many people are subscribed to ESPN plus.
*  Like, let's find that out first,
*  because you have to watch them.
*  ESPN or ESPN plus.
*  So if they have.
*  Well, they do a lot of those cards where they like fight nights.
*  Will they have it on ESPN as well?
*  ESPN. How many people are watching ESPN? Millions.
*  Millions of people.
*  So if you have like a big event, like a nice fight night,
*  like they had that last one, that was a fight night.
*  The one that they did from Saudi Arabia were Bobby Knuckles, Robert Whitaker.
*  When when he just fought and won, that's that's probably millions
*  and millions of people.
*  And then you got all the other people that are watching it all around the world, too.
*  Like, it's not just, you know, it's not just America.
*  It's people watching it in Europe.
*  The Sky TV.
*  It's like, you know, all the other countries that are watching it.
*  The USC is just a bigger name product.
*  People don't know what a Bellator is.
*  That's why they sold.
*  I think they were losing money hand over fist.
*  I heard they were losing a lot of money.
*  It's just it's hard to make money if you're not the UFC.
*  Yeah, but they but they don't know how to promote.
*  A PFL must be making money.
*  I don't think they are. I don't know how they could be.
*  If they're paying a million dollars to the tournament winners,
*  like, how are they doing that?
*  I would imagine the only way I mean, it's one thing because it does.
*  It's a good promotional thing.
*  You tell people how much money they make and you get people like,
*  oh, shit, maybe I'll go over there.
*  And you get people thinking they can win the tournament.
*  And maybe you can lure like more big name guys.
*  But then PFL has that weird point system that nobody understands.
*  Do you know that?
*  PFL. Yeah, they got it.
*  It's a crazy like if you win by stoppage in the first round, three points.
*  If you win the second round, it's two points.
*  Third pounds, one point. It's like points.
*  But I never watched the only time I watched it was when they had the bellator versus PFL.
*  Yeah, it's very weird.
*  Well, that was interesting, too, because you get to see like there's levels
*  like Johnny Eblen versus Impa Kasagany.
*  And it was really, really good.
*  And because I can is fucking good.
*  He's the guy that lost to Joaquin Buckley by that crazy head kick.
*  Oh, yeah. Jump spinning back kick, head kick.
*  And some more comeback.
*  Yeah, grabs his left leg and Joaquin hops up in the air and hits him a jump
*  spinning back kick. After that, he got kicked out of the UFC.
*  Well, he left the UFC and went to PFL.
*  And so he was representing PFL and Johnny Eblen, who is the PFL
*  middleweight champion, is really fucking good.
*  And he's like one of the guys out there that I looked at.
*  And I said, that guy could be like a UFC star.
*  But Impa Kasagany and him had a war and like Impa won a lot of that fight.
*  It was a good fight.
*  So it's like there's guys out there that are really good fighters.
*  That's my point. And nobody's seeing it.
*  Nobody's watching them.
*  Well, what happened to that guy that did that?
*  That Buckley guy. What happened to him?
*  Oh, he's in he's in welterweight now.
*  He dropped down to welterweight and he's very successful.
*  Oh, so he's doing he just knocked out Vicente Luque.
*  And who did he just knock out in the first round?
*  He just fuck somebody else up, too.
*  He's fucking good, man.
*  And he keeps getting better.
*  Joaquin Buckley just keeps getting better.
*  The thing about him is like every time you see him fight.
*  That's right.
*  That Ruzabov guy that he fought, that guy's a big dude.
*  He's like six foot three, six foot four.
*  And he fights at 170. Wow.
*  And he beat him by unanimous decision, knocked out Vicente Luque before that.
*  What's that? Six, five.
*  Yeah, six, five at 170.
*  That's nuts.
*  And, you know, that and that guy was like very highly touted going into that fight.
*  But Buckley beat him.
*  Buckley at 170 is a real force.
*  He's a real force.
*  He's just like he's one of those dudes.
*  Like he's never stop.
*  He's never going to stop learning and growing every time you see him.
*  It's a better version of Buckley and his cardio is crazy.
*  Or what camp is he at?
*  You know, he's got a very small camp in Detroit.
*  You know, it's a very small camp.
*  It's not not a big gym.
*  I haven't heard of many fights coming out of Detroit.
*  Yeah, there he is.
*  Mercy, a Lago, MMA, and it's Detroit, right?
*  Doesn't say I'm 90 percent sure.
*  That's where he's at.
*  Um, St. Louis, from St. Louis.
*  Am I wrong?
*  At a St. Louis, I'm sorry.
*  So shout out to St. Louis.
*  Sorry, I confuse you with Detroit.
*  But point is, he's like in a small team.
*  It's not it's not a big team.
*  It's not like it's not a ATT year.
*  And there's some people that think that that's not good either, because like
*  I talked to some dudes that went over to train at ATT and say, hey, man, like,
*  you got these dudes coming in from Russia and Dagestan and like you're in wars
*  every day. What's not incorrect?
*  That is in Michigan.
*  Oh, you have their pages, says like top MMA.
*  So you was so you was wrong.
*  The Internet was wrong.
*  Internet fucked up.
*  Jamie's never. He's never.
*  I'm not.
*  It isn't stuff I know.
*  OK, so they're in Michigan.
*  Lansing. That's it. Lansing, Michigan.
*  But let me tell you something.
*  Joaquin Buckley's he's he's a real force at 170.
*  I think he could be a champion.
*  It's just like he's just got to keep growing the way he's growing.
*  But it's like you see these guys when they're on the come up.
*  It's like there's so much potential you never know.
*  And some guys, they have so much potential and then it just never comes to fruit.
*  It's like that's probably you can speak to this.
*  That's probably the hardest thing is realizing your potential.
*  Yeah, yeah, because you don't know until you get out there.
*  Right. And you got to put it to test.
*  And you go out there and some people, you know, you can be really good.
*  Right. And you can and you can have like two bad days in the office.
*  Right. Lose two fights in a row.
*  Then your career is over.
*  Look at Max Holloway. Right.
*  People were writing him off.
*  People thought before he fought Dustin Port or excuse me,
*  before he fought Justin Gagey, that it was over. Yeah.
*  And he's only 32. Yeah.
*  You got to reinvent yourself.
*  You got to you can't listen to all that noise.
*  Put your head down.
*  I lost two fights in a row one time in my career.
*  And it was like I was like, what the fuck is wrong with me?
*  But you got to put your head down and come back and and try
*  because normally in the beginning of my career, like I lost to Marvin Eastman
*  in my first professional fight.
*  Then I went on a long run.
*  I didn't lose again until Sakuraba.
*  Then I lost Sakuraba and I went on a long run and I didn't lose again till
*  whoever maybe it was Vanity.
*  I can't remember who beat me out there after that.
*  But, you know, you just then you lose two fights in a row.
*  Then you start thinking like what you start doubting yourself.
*  Like, what's wrong with me?
*  What's wrong with do I suck? Now, is it over?
*  And then you got to have a strong mind.
*  You got to you got to come out.
*  Did you learn how to have a strong mind?
*  Or is it just something that you did?
*  You read books? Did you talk to someone like how did you develop?
*  How do you read my fucking?
*  Do I sound like I read?
*  I read one or I can read the Bible, but I read two books in my whole life.
*  What's the other one? Christine.
*  Stephen King book. Good book.
*  Yeah, I was in jail.
*  I had a bunch of free time on my hand.
*  I went to jail in college and I fucking would you go to jail for?
*  One of my teammates was a fucking asshole.
*  And he hit me in the mouth with, you know, the pay phone, pay phone receiver.
*  I got this scar on my lip, wherever side it is.
*  My fucking hit me in the mouth and I tried to kill him.
*  And he went to the hospital. I went to jail.
*  It was self-defense. Right.
*  But but the problem was,
*  what fucked me up is that I went back and stumped him some more.
*  And I think there was no long self-defense once you did that.
*  And I didn't I didn't know.
*  You're just in the moment. I was in the moment.
*  I was in a moment. Tim Percy, the one you saw that name up there
*  that got caught with.
*  He's my roommate. He wanted to pull me off the motherfucker.
*  Oh, wow. And I wish I wish he would just kept me in that fucking room.
*  Maybe I would have.
*  But you know what? Going going to jail that time, that changed my life.
*  Because you remember, I got a real bad temper.
*  And that that taught me how to control my temper.
*  Going to jail because I hated jail.
*  I was there for like 47 days up in Susanville.
*  That changed my fucking life.
*  I'm like, yeah, I don't see how anybody can go to jail or prison
*  and fuck up and go back to that.
*  I think you had a life already.
*  And some people don't.
*  And I think they get to jail and then in jail, you know where you're going to eat.
*  You know where you're going to sleep.
*  You know who you're hanging out with.
*  And then you get out in the real world and you have no skills
*  and nobody wants to deal with you because you're a felon.
*  And then you're just lost.
*  Yeah, I'd rather be inside.
*  Yeah, it's like it is kind of like
*  it is like you're in a fucking circle motion where, you know,
*  you got this rap sheet and you can't get a job.
*  Yeah, I can understand that.
*  People get institutionalized to they get accustomed to a schedule.
*  But I'd rather be I'd rather be out on the street just doing our jobs.
*  It's you know, it's something that you know, when I was growing up,
*  before I before I started wrestling, I was heading for prison.
*  And this is what I tell this to my boys.
*  The thing that changed my life.
*  My mom, my mom got remarried and she had and her husband had his best friend.
*  His name was Jerome Jackson.
*  He got the same last name as me because he used to when I used to get suspended
*  for school, he used to go and put me back at school like he was my dad.
*  I love this guy. He was a musician.
*  And he and he told me one day, he said, man,
*  God told me to tell you something.
*  And this is back when I was I'm from the Bible belt.
*  But, you know, I believe in God and stuff like that.
*  But I didn't I didn't know, you know what I'm saying?
*  And I was like, well, God told you to tell me something like, yeah, man, he's just,
*  you know, he put on my mind to tell you something.
*  And I'm going to tell you, he said, don't judge me.
*  I got to tell you, he said,
*  with the way you're going and the shit you're doing,
*  you know, you're heading straight for prison.
*  You know, I don't know if you know this about me, but, you know,
*  I was selling drugs at eight years old.
*  I was just a product of my environment.
*  Some guys that live across the street from me, a lot older.
*  They like me. They taught me how to fight.
*  I was drinking and smoking weed at eight.
*  You know, saying fucking bitches.
*  I thought I was grown and they was really small.
*  Eight years old. You were fucking. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Wow.
*  Yeah. My first time, fuck. I was five.
*  Whoa. Yeah. I just grew up too fast.
*  That's why I'm a big kid now. That's crazy.
*  Yeah. True story, man. I haven't lied to you yet. Wow.
*  And the guy was really smart.
*  He put drugs.
*  He put the drugs and the guns and stuff on me because I was a kid.
*  And he was like, the police are not going to look at you.
*  And if they do take you to juvenile, your mama can just get you out.
*  But if I go to jail, you'll be fucked up.
*  You know, I grew up kind of poor and I was a middle child.
*  My mom really she really wasn't studying me really.
*  And so this guy fed me and, you know, he gave me money and clothes and stuff.
*  Shit, I need. So I didn't want him to go to jail.
*  So I did it for him.
*  And then after a while, he taught me how to sell drugs.
*  So that's the environment I was in.
*  And that's how I live. Right.
*  And my mom's husband, my stepdad's best friend,
*  he knew it. My mom didn't know I was selling drugs.
*  I was really slick. But he could tell I was living that street life.
*  He said, you know, they do the young men in prison.
*  I'm like, well, now they fight them.
*  He said, no, they rape them. They fuck them.
*  I'm like, well, ain't nobody fucking me. I can fight.
*  He said, look, I seen you fight. I know you can fight.
*  At this time, I'm like 15 years old.
*  He told me this. He said, I see you fight, but I don't think you can fight
*  five motherfuckers.
*  And I thought about it.
*  I was like, damn, you know, I used to get jumped a lot,
*  but five motherfuckers in prison, five grown men.
*  And I was like, wow. He said, I said, really?
*  He said, yeah, man, they they rape kids.
*  I said, this is what God want me to tell you.
*  Let you know. I don't think nobody told you.
*  I don't think you know. Wow.
*  You're like, so whatever you're doing, you want to get off that path.
*  And then I was thinking a lot of my friends was coming up dead
*  and they was going to prison and they was getting hooked on drugs.
*  So I was like, wow, that that conversation right there
*  change, change my life.
*  And we moved to a different side of Memphis.
*  And then I started wrestling.
*  And nobody knew anything about me that I should smoke weed.
*  They didn't know anything.
*  I just changed my whole life from that one conversation.
*  So that's why then I then I found it.
*  I had been a juvenile before I got caught like driving.
*  Like I said, I used to sell crack.
*  So I gave this junkie had an eye rock.
*  So I gave him some crack.
*  Well, I'm like 14 years old.
*  You had an eye rock. Yeah. For a couple of days.
*  I gave him some crack for his car and I was driving that motherfucker.
*  And then the police saw me.
*  I took this one one lady.
*  She wanted to go to these projects.
*  I didn't know what she was doing.
*  But, you know, you know, she was doing it.
*  She had me take over there and the police saw me.
*  I guess it was a hot spot.
*  And I didn't know. And I'm waiting in the car.
*  And it's like eight o'clock in the morning.
*  The police come up to me like, what the fuck?
*  I look kid driving this car.
*  He said, don't try to be in school.
*  I can't lie. I can't lie.
*  My way out of it.
*  I would do now. My mom came and got me out of the moment.
*  What the fuck you doing?
*  I said, shit, my friend of me borrowed a car.
*  My mom had no idea I was selling drugs.
*  I kept lying to her. She didn't know.
*  And then that was just June.
*  That's just like one getting out.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I got some trouble one time.
*  I was innocent for what happened, but I was in there for two weeks.
*  I didn't think about it. It wasn't that bad.
*  But when I went to jail and in college, I'm like, fuck this.
*  I'm never coming back. Wow.
*  But I'm kind of glad it happened because it changed my life.
*  And I can kind of control my temper better now.
*  That's why I was walking out of that room in Ultimate Fighter
*  because I knew I was losing my temper.
*  I threw that water bottle and I was trying to get out of it.
*  And that door got in my fucking way.
*  So I didn't want to I didn't want to lose my temper
*  because I didn't know because I didn't know
*  if I was going to punch Rashad or anybody came up to me.
*  Right. I didn't know.
*  I just wanted to get out of there.
*  And I was like, fuck this shit.
*  But I'm glad that she happened to me in college changed my fucking life.
*  Wow. I can control I can control myself now.
*  Long as long as nobody don't punch me out of like violence
*  and nothing like that, I think I can control it.
*  Everything else, I, you know, I just think about I am going back to prison.
*  Fuck that.
*  Well, you've been able to control your mind in so many fights.
*  You know, that alone.
*  I mean, how many people get tested like that?
*  Oh, fights don't bother me.
*  But sparring is where where where I have to control myself. Really?
*  Yeah. Fights don't bother me.
*  Sparring is where I lose my temper a little bit.
*  But I'm scared because I feel like I'm going to go hog hog wild and lose
*  and lose my cardio.
*  Oh, that's the only reason why I try to control it and fighting and in sparring.
*  Oh, the worst is like losing your temper when you're sparring.
*  Yeah, that's why I lose it.
*  I thought you get tired quick, bro.
*  I sparred, I sparred Luke Rockhold.
*  I hadn't sparred in a long time.
*  And he's a Southpaw. He's tall.
*  His stand up is fucking good.
*  Yeah. And I just I thought I was going to be fighting Shannon.
*  So I said, oh, let me start sparring.
*  And he kicked the shit out of me.
*  I'm like, he didn't even fucking let up.
*  It's like it was fucking field day for his ass.
*  I was so fucking mad. I tried to knock him the fuck out.
*  And I and I was so arrested and sparring.
*  Years. My old ass in there with him.
*  I hate Southpaws.
*  And he kicked the shit out of me.
*  I was like, oh, all right.
*  And then next day, I started running because my cardio was bad.
*  Everything was bad. I started running.
*  I was waiting to spar his ass back.
*  I said, I'm going to knock this motherfucker out.
*  So right now, are you training at all?
*  Yeah. Yeah, I'm training.
*  I've been sparring and moving around.
*  I just did like my first Japanese pro wrestling match with Josh Barnett.
*  Bloodsport. Yeah, so I started training MMA with my son.
*  You know, I can I didn't have anybody to train with because my time
*  is fucking crazy because I got a podcast now because of your ass.
*  You got everybody doing fucking podcast.
*  Crazy. It's crazy, man.
*  Everybody, everybody.
*  Mama got a fucking podcast because of your motherfucking ass.
*  That's it. So time consuming.
*  It takes up time, but it's a great way to be your own boss.
*  Yeah, that's the best thing.
*  And you're a funny guy like you.
*  Your Jackson podcast. That's a great podcast.
*  It's fun. I watch it all the time.
*  For a bunch of times. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah.
*  Yeah, you have great clips, too, because it's good, man.
*  You're it's a good thing for you to do because you could do that forever.
*  People were asking me to do it for years.
*  And I was like, man, I don't have the drive to do this shit myself.
*  But my friend Barrett, he he got everything set up and he he does everything.
*  And I just come and sit down and people start liking us.
*  OK, so I guess I'm doing podcast now.
*  That's all you have to do. Someone has to set it up for you.
*  If someone's got a good personality, they should totally do it
*  because it's a way that you can make a living.
*  You don't have to get hit.
*  You don't have to be in shape.
*  You don't have to do anything.
*  Just show up and talk about shit. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But how long is it going to last?
*  Because I don't I felt like it was watered down.
*  I feel like everybody got a podcast now.
*  If you're good. Yeah, everybody has a podcast.
*  There's five million of them. Five million.
*  Five million podcasts.
*  You started. How long ago you started? 15 years ago. Oh, God. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Started in the beginning.
*  There wasn't that many back then. There was only a few.
*  What made you start your podcast?
*  I always wanted a radio show, but nobody was ever going to give me a radio show.
*  So I would do radio shows and I'd be like, man, this is fun.
*  It's fun to just sit around with friends and talk shit.
*  And then when I started doing Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony
*  was a show on Sirius XM.
*  And first of it, when I first did it, they were on the regular radio.
*  And then they went to Sirius and Sirius XM.
*  And you could maybe I didn't do it when they were on the regular radio.
*  But the point was like you could swear when they were on Sirius.
*  So it was in I would be on with like four or five other comedians.
*  We would have a ball. It was so fun.
*  I would look it was the only show I'd look forward to getting up for.
*  I get up early in the morning, smoke a joint, get a cup of coffee,
*  go in that room and everybody would just talk shit.
*  We had so much fun.
*  I was like, damn, I wish I had a radio show.
*  But no one would hire me for a radio show.
*  And so I thought about it. I was like, no, fuck it up anyway.
*  I talked about too many crazy things.
*  It's like I need to just do something on the Internet,
*  even if no one's going to listen.
*  I was like, at least it'd be fun.
*  And the beginning, you know,
*  you know, if we got a thousand people watch it, that was a lot.
*  Nobody was watching it.
*  But I thought it was fun. So I just kept doing it.
*  And then it just kept growing.
*  I didn't promote it.
*  I didn't take out ads. I didn't make videos.
*  Please watch my podcast.
*  I didn't go on other podcasts and tell people to watch my podcast.
*  I just kept doing it. Just kept doing it.
*  Just kept doing it. Just work ethic.
*  And then eventually it started making money.
*  Bro, during covid, I heard people complaining that
*  that your podcast was more listened to than the news.
*  And people was hating on you.
*  Like when when you was talking about I've been making it.
*  Oh, my God. Well, they were threatened.
*  They were troubled. Well, that was also they were being paid off
*  by the medical establishment. They were being paid off.
*  They were being paid to promote this one thing.
*  And that was the vaccine.
*  And anybody that said anything other than the vaccine.
*  I mean, CNN did me so dirty.
*  They changed the color of my skin to make me look yellow and sick.
*  They mean they kept saying I was taking horse deworming.
*  I got prescribed medicine by a doctor.
*  Not only that, it was only one of the things that I took.
*  I took a bunch of things, but they did not want this video of me
*  saying I got better in three days.
*  So it's a video of me. You see the real video.
*  I look fine. I was fine.
*  I wasn't lying. I wouldn't lie.
*  And I had to cancel these shows because I was doing shows
*  with Chappelle that weekend.
*  We were supposed to be doing this arena.
*  And I had to say, I'm sorry, we're going to reschedule it.
*  But I've I got covid.
*  That's the only reason why I made that video.
*  If I didn't have shows that I had to cancel,
*  I would have never made that video.
*  I only made that video because I had to cancel the shows.
*  So I said, I feel great.
*  It was three days ago. We threw the kitchen sink at it.
*  I said all these drugs I took, IV, multivitamins, monoclonal antibodies.
*  I said all this stuff that I took ZPAC.
*  But they'd locked in on this horse dewormer.
*  Because it was a fool.
*  But what they didn't know back then, because people that I didn't talk about it.
*  I never knew.
*  They didn't know how big the podcast was.
*  Oh, no, no, no, no. They didn't know how big that.
*  That's the problem. But they knew the drug work.
*  Right. They did know the drug work.
*  And it did work.
*  And it worked for a lot of people that didn't take all the other stuff that I took.
*  I was better quick.
*  Six days after that, I did 10 rounds on the bag.
*  I worked out five days after I got sick.
*  And I'm like, I feel pretty good.
*  Next day, I'm going to push it.
*  And then the next day, I said, all right, there's one way to find out how good I feel.
*  Set the timer up. Let's do some rounds.
*  And I did 10 solid rounds on the bag.
*  At the end, I was like, I feel 100 percent.
*  I feel totally normal.
*  I swear by it. I knew when you talked about it, I knew you was right, because
*  I had learned about it like a while ago, a little bit before when COVID first
*  started happening, because I got this friend.
*  She's a box with Floyd Mayweather's dad.
*  And her name is Miss Knockout.
*  She got this assistant from some South American country,
*  and they had symptoms like COVID years ago, like maybe 15, 20 years ago.
*  And they took Ivermectin.
*  And so she told me about she said, if you get COVID,
*  let me know, I'm going to get you some Ivermectin.
*  I had never heard of it.
*  She said this.
*  She said my sister had COVID and she and she got rid of in six days
*  and have a negative to give a negative test.
*  I said, OK, I keep it on my radar.
*  And my son called. I never called COVID, but my son called.
*  And I got the I got the medicine and I gave it to him.
*  And they could have saved a lot of lives.
*  Yeah. And they still to this day ridicule it.
*  Still to this day, people ridicule it.
*  But meanwhile, doctors prescribed it.
*  And one of the reasons why they prescribed it is because there's a reason.
*  There's a medical reason.
*  It stops viral replicate replication in vitro.
*  That means in cell cultures, when you put Ivermectin in with the virus,
*  it stops the virus from replicating.
*  So it just makes sense that it would stop it in the human body, too.
*  It stops yellow fever and dengue.
*  They've used it for river blindness.
*  They've used it for a bunch of different diseases.
*  It's also very healthy. It doesn't.
*  It's not a dangerous drug.
*  It's just one of the safest drug profiles of any drug.
*  It's not a dangerous thing to take.
*  But do you think your body get used to it?
*  Because I take it for colds because I hate colds.
*  I don't think it's something that you get used to.
*  No, because I remember when I first thought when I first started taking it,
*  because I stocked up on the case, I got COVID and I got like a look,
*  run a nose and a cold.
*  And I and I took it and took it away right right away. Right.
*  And then the next couple of times it took away.
*  Then like the fourth time I got a cold, it didn't.
*  They tried to.
*  Well, that could have been just a different cold or different,
*  you know, different intensity of the cold.
*  But they tried to ban a lot of other things secretly that also that help people.
*  One of the things was thymus and thymus and is a peptide.
*  It's a safe peptide.
*  There's no history of like negative side effects.
*  And they they tried to ban it because people were using thymus and to get over COVID.
*  They tried to do everything they could to make people take the vaccine,
*  because that's what was profitable. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Everything. They tried to stop people from taking monoclonal antibodies,
*  which also helped heal you.
*  But they they didn't want any alternatives.
*  So when they started attacking me, they were only attacking me
*  because people could say, oh, Joe Rogan got better. Yeah.
*  Oh, he's healthy and he works out.
*  I don't need that fucking vaccine.
*  If that fifty five year old man took it and he's fine.
*  Quick. Yeah.
*  And they didn't like they exaggerated how many people died.
*  The whole thing was fucked, man. The whole thing was fucked.
*  They treated us like we were a bunch of sheep.
*  And a lot of people acted like they're a bunch of sheep.
*  Yeah. A lot of people, you know, and they didn't have any alternative
*  news sources other than podcasts.
*  And so then they were just really why are people listening to podcasts?
*  They should be listening to doctors.
*  Well, because we don't lie. That's why. Right.
*  I might be wrong. I may be wrong about things.
*  I'll be wrong about things, I'm sure.
*  But I don't fucking lie. Right.
*  I'm not a liar. They're liars.
*  They're liars and they're on TV.
*  The TV is filled with liars.
*  I don't even watch the news no more. Fucking more. Yeah.
*  I don't trust that shit. You shouldn't trust that shit.
*  I mean, I don't trust mainstream news anymore.
*  If they're telling you something, someone's telling them to tell you something.
*  Some of the things might be true.
*  But the reasons for those things being true, they're probably not telling you.
*  I'm going to tell you COVID and all this stuff that happened.
*  It woke me up to a lot of things
*  that were just not trusted government and stuff and everything.
*  I'm going to be 100 right now.
*  The main reason why I decided not to take the vaccine is because
*  I saw the interview with Bill and Melinda Gates.
*  Really? That interview, them saying that they got to give it to blacks
*  and Latinos first. I said, oh, fuck that. I'm not taking it.
*  They never want to give our black ass shit first. Fuck that.
*  That's why I didn't take it.
*  I didn't take this shit.
*  Because of the history of them giving vaccines to people in Africa.
*  There's some horror stories.
*  They they gave vaccines to people in Africa where they told these people
*  that it was for it was the DTP vaccine.
*  But it had H.C.G. in it, which is something that stops women from being fertile.
*  And they gave it to them on a schedule that didn't make sense.
*  So people started investigating.
*  They found that they were putting enough H.C.G.
*  in it to make sure these women didn't have kids.
*  They basically vaccinated them against being pregnant.
*  And who knows what the fuck that's doing to their bodies.
*  It's fucked up. And they didn't tell them they were doing it.
*  That's fucked up, bro.
*  There's a lot of a lot of sketchy stuff.
*  So I see Fauci is getting in trouble.
*  But how can nobody say anything about Bill Gates?
*  And why will we listen to him about medicine anyway?
*  About anything health? Yeah. He's fat.
*  He's got a big pot belly. But he's a computer guy.
*  Not only that, he's got no medical degree.
*  I mean, I don't even think he has a college degree.
*  And he looks like shit.
*  Like, why are you taking health advice from a guy that looks like shit
*  just because he invested a bunch of money in the company?
*  I couldn't figure out why he was even on television talking about it.
*  Doesn't make any sense.
*  I couldn't figure that shit out for the life of me.
*  Money. It's all money.
*  That's what I made a lot of money off those vaccines, by the way.
*  He made a lot of money and he dumped dumped all stock.
*  And then he started talking shit about the vaccine.
*  Oh, he's talking shit about the talk about it afterwards.
*  It wasn't as effective as we'd hoped.
*  It didn't stop transmission like, oh, oh, oh, now you tell us.
*  The crazy thing was that people that was taking the vaccine,
*  they was a super spreaders.
*  Well, what happens is, unfortunately,
*  there's there's different strains of the vaccine.
*  And one of the things that they've realized with
*  one of the things that virologists will say is you never vaccinate
*  during a pandemic.
*  The reason they say and again, I'm not an expert, but the reason they say
*  is when you vaccinate during a pandemic, it encourages variants.
*  Because what happens is when you have a vaccine,
*  it targets a very specific strain of the virus.
*  So then new strains come around that evade the vaccines immunity.
*  And so then you have all these new strains over time.
*  It makes the virus weaker.
*  So the new viruses get weaker and weaker so that they get more infectious.
*  So they can infect you, but it doesn't kill you.
*  So you could spread it to more people.
*  That's how viruses survive.
*  They're sneaky, little clever motherfuckers, these viruses.
*  But when they do that, I mean, this is what veterinarians were saying.
*  All these different virologists were saying, like you don't.
*  But they silenced all those people.
*  That was the craziest thing that happened is they silenced legitimate experts.
*  They banned them from being on social media.
*  They banned them from talking about it on YouTube.
*  People from Harvard, Stanford,
*  really legitimate doctors who had a differing opinion
*  about how things were handled.
*  I said they were silenced and treated like fools. It's evil.
*  They pay all that money for the education.
*  And then when it's time to use it and help a lot of people.
*  Not only that, science is always supposed to be questioned.
*  Science is all about a bunch of different experts
*  giving peer review on a subject, right?
*  But they're not supposed to be biased and bought and paid for.
*  But that's the problem with today.
*  Whenever there's so much money involved in one thing,
*  like a vaccine or any kind of medicine, you get a bunch of people
*  that are willing to bullshit in order to sell that medicine.
*  And so when someone doesn't want to do that and they have a different opinion,
*  it doesn't go with the narrative.
*  They just make that person out to be a crazy.
*  That's a crackpot. They're nuts.
*  Meanwhile, these are like legitimate PhDs, like legitimate scientists.
*  Well respected up until that moment in their field.
*  But you know what? I asked myself sometimes, like,
*  what if I was in this situation, would I sell out?
*  I always say that about UFOs.
*  Like, I would lie. Show me the UFOs.
*  I won't tell nobody.
*  I'll tell them. I'll say, oh, it's all bullshit.
*  I will lie. I'll lie. Show me.
*  Show me. I'll sell out for that. I'll sell out for aliens.
*  You really believe in that? No.
*  You know, you got all these aliens. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I know, but I don't. Why? I do kind of.
*  This is what I think.
*  I think the odd if if there is alien life out there, I think
*  if you look at the just the immense size of the universe,
*  there's hundreds of billions of galaxies
*  and each galaxy has hundreds of billions of solar systems.
*  The odds of there not being other life out there is almost zero.
*  I think it is zero.
*  I think for sure there's other life out there.
*  And if there was other life out there, if they found out about us,
*  these crazy territorial apes that have nuclear weapons
*  and they have cell phones and they're taking pictures of their dicks
*  and they're fucking sending videos across the world,
*  they're stealing resources and pulling oil out, killing all the fish.
*  I'd be like, these fucking things are nuts.
*  This this species on Earth,
*  the dominant species is completely insane.
*  They lie on the news.
*  They pretend they're monogamous and they're not.
*  They're doing drugs.
*  Everyone's saying just say no to drugs while they're on drugs.
*  I mean, it's a crazy species.
*  They elect officials.
*  The officials get paid off by everybody and they're all lying about this.
*  They're getting people into wars, they're getting people into pandemics
*  because they're doing research on viruses and the viruses accidentally get out.
*  And they go, no, that was just a wild virus.
*  How could they knew it wasn't? They're just liars.
*  If I was an alien, I would be studying us like crazy.
*  I would visit. I think they probably have visited.
*  But I also don't believe the government.
*  So when the government says they have off world vehicles,
*  they're not not from this earth.
*  Like, oh, you guys got a drone that you don't want anybody to know about.
*  I think that's a lot of it.
*  But I'm going to tell you this, brother.
*  I'm going to tell you this.
*  Your your boy, Eddie Bravo, he knows some shit,
*  but he just sound crazy when he said, oh, he knows a lot.
*  He knows a lot.
*  I think he knows a lot.
*  I think he's definitely wrong about some things.
*  He wrong about come on. We all are.
*  But I'm tell you, when I watch him and I watch him explain stuff,
*  I like he goes deep.
*  He goes deep. It's just how he explains it.
*  He knows a lot about conspiracies that are absolutely legit.
*  He educates me on some and where I start reading about him like, oh, shit, he's right.
*  You know, and you find out some things about the government
*  and things about what they've done before Operation Paperclip.
*  They've run all the Nazis to start NASA.
*  You like what? NASA was started by Nazis.
*  And then you realize, I like what?
*  And then the Kennedy assassination.
*  You just there's so many conspiracies that turn out to be look at the coincidences.
*  Like this too many.
*  And so I think there are extraterrestrials,
*  but I don't think they're from outer space.
*  That's possible to come from the water.
*  But that's possible because they come from the other side of the ice wall.
*  Oh, you're going to get into that.
*  No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
*  No, and he's right about that part.
*  I don't think he's right about that.
*  I think that there's too much evidence that it's not true.
*  Also, it's like the way planets are formed.
*  We know how planets are formed.
*  There's a reason why they're all circular.
*  That's like all the mass can coalesce in the center and the gravity
*  and the way things spin and all forms balls.
*  But the idea that we know what the fuck is going on in the ocean is ridiculous.
*  We don't know what's going on in 90 percent of the ocean.
*  And the water surface is three quarters of the earth.
*  So three quarters of the earth, we don't know 90 percent about it.
*  I know that's great.
*  There's a lot of people that see things coming out of the water and going into the water.
*  Also, if I was from another planet and I wanted to come here and make a base,
*  I just do it in the water. They can't see shit.
*  If they have the kind of capability that allows them to come here from other galaxies,
*  they could easily make a base under the water.
*  Yeah, that's probably what the Bermuda Triangle is.
*  We don't fuck it now.
*  Well, they think the Bermuda Triangle is methane
*  getting released under the floor of the ocean.
*  And what it does is when it comes up, it kills all the buoyancy.
*  You know, it makes it makes boats sink.
*  No, no, they have like they know where it is.
*  That sounds like when I watch the men in black and right away.
*  They hit you with that thing.
*  It sounds like this is the excuse.
*  Oh, right, right, right.
*  It could be there's something under the water that's sinking boats.
*  I don't think it is, though.
*  I think there's like a valid scientific reason.
*  So this this these gases get released.
*  And apparently, if there's a boat above when all these get like
*  we're talking about immense spaces of this gas gets released.
*  Those boats just sink.
*  And it's not just that.
*  It's like the updraft of this stuff can fuck up planes.
*  There's a lot of theories about what causes it.
*  It's also like there's so many storms in that area of Bermuda.
*  So it makes sense that more ships would go down in those areas, too.
*  But I still think there's probably something in there.
*  There's probably something in the water.
*  Have you seen that video, that one craft that they're watching on night vision
*  and it flies over the water and then goes down into the water?
*  No, I haven't seen that.
*  Yeah, they call them transmedium crafts.
*  They've been observed by multiple fighter jet pilots,
*  different people on fighter on battleships.
*  They've observed them going into the water.
*  And they think that's UFOs.
*  They think there's something going on.
*  They don't know if it's China's or Russia's or it could even be ours.
*  That's the thing that drives me crazy.
*  So this was the problem is right now we got cell phones, right?
*  With the cameras and technology so good,
*  we can see a lot more things than we could like 20, 30 years ago.
*  Right. So I feel like if the military has a lot of stuff
*  they don't want us to know about, they can say, like, oh, it's a UFO.
*  But why are they telling us now that, you know, now?
*  Right. Exactly.
*  So that's exactly how I feel.
*  When they're telling you that it's a UFO, my hand.
*  And the thing is, they're always happening near military bases.
*  There was happening the coast of the water off of San Diego.
*  That's all military all over San Diego.
*  East Coast in all of the restricted air spaces.
*  That's where they see these things, which is exactly where they would practice
*  if they had these things.
*  If they was if we got our technology strong enough,
*  or we could go to different planets, would you would you like to go?
*  No, I'd be scared as fuck that.
*  Fuck that. Yeah, fuck that.
*  We talked about like they do SpaceX flights.
*  My I ain't going to be that dude that dies like that.
*  Fuck that.
*  Imagine the feeling you would have, how stupid you would feel
*  if you if you're up in the jet or in the rocket and you hear
*  the things start breaking.
*  You don't feel stupid for a couple of seconds.
*  Boom. Right before that thing blew, you'd probably like my dumb ass
*  could be at home with a margarita right now.
*  I'd be at home with my feet up on the fucking couch watching TV
*  or out in the yard listening to birds chirp.
*  My stupid ass is dying.
*  Just so I can get a couple hundred miles above the surface and look down,
*  because that's all you can get.
*  Yeah. You only get a couple hundred miles.
*  Yeah. You can't really go to another planet.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to go to another planet.
*  Well, Elon's trying to go to Mars.
*  Fuck. I'm not going to be one of those dudes.
*  I'm staying right here.
*  How do you think those dudes felt when they tried to go see the Titanic?
*  Bro. What was they thinking, bro?
*  They're just rich people that for whatever stupid reason,
*  wanted to go on an adventure.
*  But not only that, they're looking through a screen.
*  They're looking through a screen.
*  They just wanted to be there.
*  But the moment before that thing fucking imploded,
*  apparently it was free falling before it imploded.
*  So they knew it was over.
*  They knew it was over for a few seconds.
*  Oh, I would have had a heart attack, I think.
*  I would have probably got a heart attack.
*  I bet a lot of them did.
*  They probably they probably hyperventilated, went into shock.
*  How many was on there?
*  I don't know. Yeah, man.
*  I don't remember. Yeah.
*  I don't know. Fuck.
*  I don't know if they were able to think.
*  So apparently they're talking about doing it again.
*  All right. So so no one has been able to go down to the Titanic.
*  So it's too far.
*  Well, no, they've sent.
*  They had man craft that went down to the Titanic,
*  because I went to the Titanic Museum this past weekend at the Luxor in Vegas.
*  They have a chunk of it.
*  They could see that this big piece that they pulled up
*  and different artifacts they pulled up.
*  So they did go down there and attach things with man crafts.
*  And then they pulled them up with some kind of drone.
*  But I do think people have actually I think
*  I think James Cameron actually went down there.
*  Here is the 14th trip. Yeah.
*  The Titan made the first of several dives.
*  The famous shipwreck of the world was generally successful.
*  These expeditions hadn't been without their own problems.
*  The fatal dive was the vessel's 14th trip to the remains of the Titanic.
*  Oh, it probably just wore out then.
*  It probably just probably.
*  Well, apparently the people that designed it and built it
*  were telling them there was flaws in it.
*  And there was a lot of lawsuits coming, I'm sure,
*  because there was a lot of whistleblowers that it wound up leaving the corporation,
*  the company rather, that developed these things.
*  They're like, this is not tested for the kind of pressure that's down there.
*  And you're you're sending people down there.
*  And I just believe there's certain things that men shouldn't.
*  Certain places, man shouldn't go.
*  Well, it's certain bottom of the ocean.
*  Yeah, we just shouldn't go. Why go? Why?
*  Certain things we shouldn't do.
*  I don't think we should be jumping out of planes on this.
*  He either. I just don't believe that.
*  I'm not interested in that.
*  People who you should go skydiving.
*  No, you go skydiving.
*  My friend, his dad used to work with this lady.
*  And when he would go into work, she's like, you should go skydiving with us.
*  And then one day he goes to work and she's not there.
*  And he said, what happened? It's like. Skydiving.
*  But I tell you what, it looks fun, though.
*  You seen the motherfuckers in those squirrels looking suits.
*  Oh, yeah, that should look fun.
*  But I see it on TikTok, but they scared like they be like,
*  what if they hit a tree going that motherfucking fast?
*  You ever see the one where the guy hits the bridge? No.
*  We'll watch this and we'll end this podcast.
*  Show the one where the guy hits the bridge in the squirrel suit.
*  So this dude was trying to go through the arches of the bridge and he missed it.
*  Yeah, watch this.
*  So he's on the thing and he's trying to fly past the bridge.
*  And he's got a bunch of people on the bridge watching this, too.
*  Like, oh, my God, this is amazing. It looks fun.
*  Yeah, I mean, he's going like 100 and something miles an hour, too.
*  So he's trying to figure out how to get through this bridge.
*  But watch this. Oh, fuck.
*  Bro, that sound, that's a horrible sound.
*  He just misjudged. Well, he just exploded.
*  Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  Just misjudged. Why would you try to go through the bridge?
*  Fuck that. Showing off.
*  Showing off. Yeah.
*  Just want to do something.
*  People have done things like that. They fly between buildings.
*  They do a bunch of wild shit with those squirrel suits on.
*  But if you misjudge it, that's your ass.
*  Showing out.
*  Hey, showing off. Quentin. Thank you, sir.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  It's been a great experience.
*  It's been great to be here and to hang out with you, man.
*  See you after all these years. Yeah, I know. It's been a long time.
*  I'm going to hold you to those tickets. Yes, sir. I got you.
*  I got you for two tickets.
*  Tiki always let me know. I get to bring me somebody.
*  I'll bring you somebody. Yeah.
*  I think that's September 14th.
*  So I got you. September 14th.
*  Yes, sir. I'll be there. All right.
*  It's going to be a banging car.
*  It's going to be crazy inside that thing with all the whole ceiling is a screen.
*  Yeah. So, I mean, who knows what they're going to put up there.
*  It's going to be wild.
*  Apparently, they've been working on it this entire time.
*  They've been working on it for months.
*  I think they already spent nine million dollars just on the production.
*  Sixteen. Sixteen now.
*  What the fuck? Jesus.
*  They got fucking they worth billions now.
*  So, yeah, throwing that money around.
*  Yeah. Tell everybody where to get your podcast.
*  They can go to what Jackson on YouTube.
*  Right. I think it's on Spotify.
*  It's two X's or one X.
*  Oh, like your shirt. Like your shirt.
*  There you go. Oh, thanks for the plug.
*  No, no worries.
*  So it's Jackson podcast on YouTube.
*  And is it on everything like Spotify?
*  I think we just got on Spotify.
*  OK, so but tell them about the energy drink and your energy drink.
*  What's good for him? I'm glad you like it.
*  It's very good. That's my favorite.
*  F3 energy drink.
*  Jin Sing, it's got all sorts of good stuff.
*  BCAA is the anine.
*  What else they got in there?
*  But it won't make you get caught below.
*  It won't make you get caught. Not yet.
*  Not yet. Version two.
*  If they come out with one that says rent page punch or something,
*  there it is. Rent page punch.
*  No, you're going to make it big.
*  In Japanese letters.
*  All right, brother. Thank you for being here.
*  Bye, everybody.
