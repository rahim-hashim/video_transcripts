# Joe Rogan Experience #1377 - Rick Baker
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 05, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRUy8E6ueeo)
*  Here we go in three two one Rick Baker ladies and gentlemen, how are you sir? Hey, I'm great Joe
*  Everybody's been saying on my Instagram. I should do this podcast for ages. Well, I'm glad they listened or you listen brother
*  I've been a fan of yours forever, man
*  I was a huge Star Wars fan when I was a kid and you inspired me when I was young
*  I really wanted to be a makeup artist. I wanted to do special effects and the kind of stuff that you do
*  I had no idea. Yeah, man. I think it was probably
*  Star Wars that kicked it off for me because I like many kids a lot of people today
*  You know were so removed with first VHS and then DVDs and laserdiscs and now streaming
*  It's so easy to watch movies. But when Star Wars came out we would go see it over and over and over again
*  It was like a little contest between a lot of the kids that I went to school with I think I saw it
*  13 times while it was out in the movie theater, but I became
*  Fascinated I've always been fascinated with comic books
*  I always wanted to be a comic book illustrator and I always loved like
*  like those
*  Fantasy novels like creepy and eerie, you know those those graphic novels, but I really became fascinated
*  with special effects and
*  Particularly makeup after your work. Well, you know, it's kind of the same thing for me
*  I mean, you know, I I grew up and I was born in 1950, you know
*  I grew up in front of a TV, but it was a little black and white one, you know, and and
*  There was always the monster movies on Saturdays, you know
*  And or Sundays and that just stuff just hit a chord with me and I just said I have to do this
*  When did you what was the first thing that you did?
*  First first ever makeup kind of I did well, I mean that you know, I was I'm an only child
*  my mom wasn't supposed to have kids because she had a bad heart and stuff and and but they wanted children and
*  But I was very shy I
*  Stayed in my bedroom. I couldn't talk to an adult and stuff like that
*  you know the very first thing I you know, I got interested in makeup and I got some just white grease paint and black grease paint and
*  smeared it on my face and
*  Just with a layer of grease paint on my face when I was looking in the mirror
*  It wasn't little Ricky Baker anymore and I could do things that I couldn't do without this shit smeared on my face
*  And it just it helped me overcome my shyness but I mean it it started with that but I mean I but I wanted to
*  Do something more, you know, so I ended up making I made my first mask. I think when I was 13
*  And it was a curse of Frankenstein
*  Frankenstein and I did that one mainly because I thought I could copy that one and make it look close enough because it's it's
*  There's some crudeness to that makeup. I've actually
*  It first didn't like it but I like it now
*  You know, I mean it's when you find out how the film industry works and poor Philip Leakey who did that makeup had like a
*  Week to prep, you know and no money so I forgive some of the faults with it
*  well, it's great when you stop and think about the earliest versions of
*  Makeup in movies like special effects style makeup and movies, you know
*  You go back to like Nosferatu is probably one of the very earliest, right?
*  I mean they really didn't have anything to go with there wasn't anything to copy. Yeah, they kind of had to make it up
*  Yeah, and I mean, you know, the thing is the Nosferatu is such a I mean, it's a great film
*  It's a great film still to this day. Yeah, and and the look, you know, I mean it shouldn't work by all right
*  You know, it's like a big hook nose, you know
*  but it works great and
*  But yeah, it's same thing. I mean Lon Chaney had
*  Nothing to work with you know, right spirit gum and cotton and and he did to this day
*  Some of the still the bet my favorite makeups and some of the best makeups and I think the limitations in a lot of ways
*  Made the makeup to work better, you know
*  I mean you now we can add so much stuff and I find that happens so much now like with that face-off show and stuff
*  People it's more like about how much can you pile on someone's face?
*  You know, but sometimes the most effective makeups are just the teeniest little bit of things that you do and
*  Let a lot of the humanity show through like Lon Chaney and in Phantom of the Opera a great makeup
*  Yeah, that's a terrific and Chaney was just brilliant. Yes, you know, I'm great at making scary faces
*  That's how I learned to make scary faces watching Chaney movies. Yeah, he's another one
*  There was like there was not much for him to go on it wasn't he was kind of like a pioneer
*  For sure and I mean again, like I said, it's still some of my favorite makeups that and you know, Jack Pierce's Frankenstein's monster
*  Yes again crude materials, you know
*  Any you know, it was and you know poor Boris Karloff what he had to endure
*  I mean that isn't is none of the makeups he did on Boris were comfortable, you know with
*  Cotton and spirit gum and collodion collodion. I don't know if you know you might know now just because of your
*  Fight background kind of stuff, but it's a plastic they used to use it to close up
*  Boxers wounds and stuff
*  it's like kind of this liquid plastic but it smells horrible and you know to be working around someone's eyes with this fumes of stuff and
*  Yeah, I mean he had to put up with a lot. So it's kind of like a glue
*  Yeah, it's a kind of a liquidy plastic II stuff. He pulled a video of Nosferatu. What year was that?
*  20 I don't know what I did 22 20. That's crazy
*  Yeah, stop and think about that, you know film itself had only been how old then yeah, not very
*  Yeah, you can get a video of it. Yeah his
*  Just the whole thing about the way he moved like everything. It was so creepy and interesting
*  Well, no whole film and we just beautifully shot. I mean so many of the silent films
*  I mean the photography is so incredible, you know
*  I mean, I wonder how what they did with the fingers like how they get his fingers
*  Well, those I think those are just his hands at this point, you know, I mean later I mean in in like the
*  John Barrymore, dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde
*  You know, they I remember reading in famous monsters, which was again might like my Bible, you know, right did you get famous monsters at all?
*  Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, you said creepy. Yeah, you know sure
*  You know, they said, you know, John Barrymore did the whole transformation without makeup, you know, and it's not true
*  He's got finger extensions on right like a pointed back of a head, you know
*  But yeah, it's
*  Nosferatu brilliant. So what did they do for his ears? Do you know?
*  Well, I don't sure what they're made out of same with the bald head
*  I mean, I know rubber existed then I mean you can kind of see I mean he's got I think it's probably just like a
*  Slip rubber which is like, you know, how what we Halloween masks are made out of ears and bald head and nose
*  Yeah, some sort of prosthetic nose, right? Yeah in those big pointy teeth
*  But again, I mean if you if you really kind of analyze it and look at it
*  You think this is stupid it'll never work
*  But it works great and I also think it's because Mack Shrek was great, you know
*  Yeah does some really cool things with his hands and stuff
*  Well, if you didn't if nothing like this existed and it was dark out and you saw a guy like that in your house
*  You would freak out. Well, that's terrifying. Well, it's not somebody in my house anyway
*  Yeah, someone's smiling
*  Yeah, it's just it's such an interesting time capsule when you look at these films and you look at something like like Nosferatu from
*  1922 and then you look at what we're doing today with CGI in a lot of ways
*  I mean, I'm not a fan of CGI. I'm not a fan of it in terms of
*  Like for monsters month, it just seems everything seems fake
*  There's the suspension of disbelief is higher than if I'm like what you did with American Werewolf in London
*  What one of the more brilliant things about it was the special effects and the makeup were?
*  Fantastic, but they were these really quick scenes. It was like you saw it for a second
*  It was burned into your eyes and then and then it vanished
*  Yeah
*  Well what John Landis said to me is that I'm I'm never gonna really show the werewolf for more than a couple seconds
*  And I hardly even want to show it then, you know, right and what was great about werewolf working on that film with John Landis
*  Was he?
*  You know said you're the expert that I want a four-legged hound from hell
*  I wanted to make a biped werewolf, you know, we argued about it and it was basically, you know, he wins
*  He's the director, you know, but he says four-legged hound from hell make it and I did
*  I mean the first sculpture was what the final thing became same with everything in it the Nazi demons all that stuff
*  Mmm, you know cut to you know, like when I did the wolf man
*  I mean it thousands designs and and you know all these producers are going
*  Well, maybe if you do one between this and that and one between this and that and or maybe this poor should be over here
*  You know and that kind of stuff just is so soul-sucking
*  Yeah, and it's one of the reasons I retired, you know, I just and but to this day
*  I mean like on the on the cover of my my book is the sculpture from
*  Of the one of the Nazi demons from American werewolf and in a number of people said this is like one of the greatest designs
*  ever, you know this kind of stuff and it's people who are production designers and stuff and it was it's pure Rick Baker without
*  Interference right and and that's what I thought the industry would be in right which it isn't for the most part
*  Well, it's just everybody wants to it's the same with comedy it's the same it seems like it's the same with everything everybody wants
*  To put their greasy little fingerprints on it and and say that's the reason why his nose is like that was me
*  Yeah, I told Rick Baker. You don't know what you're doing. Yeah, you got to make the nose wider
*  Yeah, no, I know. Yeah, that's oh and it's you know, it's watered watered down the designs. Yeah, I said it's soul-sucking
*  I mean if and when you know, you know sculptures take a long time
*  You know, you see we sculpt every pore and every wrinkle and everything, you know
*  I have like magnifying glasses I wear when I'm doing this and after you spend
*  You know hours and sleepless nights doing it and then some guy who doesn't know what he's talking about comes in this as well
*  You know, why don't you do this? You know, well, they're disturbing your artistic vision
*  It's just it's I mean when someone contributes money and they're the ones who get to decide whether things get made or not
*  Maybe you know just they think they're artistic as well. Yeah, it becomes a disaster and it's the thing
*  You know, I mean when you see a movie or TV show and others
*  47 producers. Yeah, you know it used to be they were show people and it was a guy, you know
*  for example on gremlins to
*  Mike Fennell who is the producer who came from Roger Corman?
*  school of filmmaking, you know, so you really checks every penny and
*  But he was a guy I could go to and he go what he he would look at everything
*  You go, why is it? Why is this why you buying this and you'd explain it to him and you go?
*  Okay, that makes sense
*  And there'd be a person you could talk to and you could get an answer from it now
*  There's like I said 47 producers and nobody will commit to anything, you know
*  It's it drove me crazy. And you know, I mean I it was I I did makeup because I loved it and I was I feel
*  so fortunate that
*  My hobby became my profession and I did well and got awards for it and stuff and for something I would do for free
*  you know, but it got to the point where I
*  Was just becoming a bitter old man because of all this and I decided I have to retire and I want to make things for myself
*  Well, I still can't you know, I'm almost 69 years old and you know
*  I'm having trouble with joints and vision and all kinds of stuff, you know
*  and I I'd be pissed off if I was working on some movie for some producer that
*  Didn't know what he was talking about and I screwed up my work, you know
*  Yeah, so it's time to just you know, make my own thing and I'm loving it, you know, like what kind of stuff are you doing?
*  No, I do all kinds of stuff. I mean I I still do makeups, you know for fun
*  I've actually cast up some of my I saved a lot of moles
*  I cast up some of the old Star Wars stuff animals and stuff and I do animations I
*  Make models I make little movies. I but you're just doing it purely for the joy of it painting and sculpting
*  It's just like it was when I was a kid. My bedroom was my workshop, you know
*  And it you know, I'm surprised I'm still alive, you know, I was I had a
*  Bunch of toxic chemicals in the same room that I slept, you know, and
*  But it's you know, it's what I've done since I was a kid. It's how I have fun
*  It's how I entertain myself, you know, and and like I said on my Instagram everybody's going, you know
*  I thought you retired and I said I retired from the film industry. I didn't retire from being a creative guy
*  I mean, this is who I am. This is what I do. It's how I have fun. That's awesome
*  You know as much as the process was probably annoying with the wolf man. The end result was cool
*  I really loved how you did it and you made it old school
*  It was kind of like almost like the original wolf man, but like read, you know redone. Yeah
*  Well, I was you know, I'm a fan, you know, and and you know, and I think it's I think that too
*  I mean people who love what they're doing and to come up from a fanboy
*  Point of view, you know, it's it and it's something I think the producers don't understand because they're all about
*  Making as much money as they can and they think everybody's trying to cheat them out of money and stuff
*  There's so many times I I would say, you know, why did you hire me?
*  You know, if you don't you're not letting me do what I do, right?
*  And it's like well, you're the best and I go well, let me do what I let me be the best
*  I have some faith, you know, I mean you're making it so I can't and the wolf man was a case like that
*  I mean it was a battle through the whole thing and that was one of these things with thousands of designs and changed this
*  Yeah thing, but I thought that you know in the end
*  The original director left right before we started filming they brought somebody else in and I just said we don't have an approved design
*  I'm making what I thought I should have made seven months ago
*  I did a test on myself that basically looked like that. We don't have time to screw around
*  The new director isn't gonna have a choice
*  Which I don't think he was really happy about but in the end
*  I mean I thought you know that the movie was a closest thing to an old-school horror movie in a long time
*  It was but it also had the feel like a lot of people fucked with it
*  It felt like it was missing an individual or singular vision. Well, it's every movie now. Yes
*  That's so frustrating to hear well, I think care Tarantino still pulls it off
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, he's one of the rare guys that still you you watch a movie go
*  Jesus Christ like the shit that he gets away with that's a Tarantino movie like once upon a time in Hollywood
*  That is a Tarantino movie
*  Oh, there's no like if you told if I saw that movie and you said who made that movie?
*  I'd be fucking Tarantino made that movie if they didn't they're going to jail
*  I
*  Just he gets away with so much in his movies seem like his movies and he's a fan boy
*  Yeah, he knows movies really well and and no I mean thank God for him, you know
*  I mean I really enjoy his films. I met Quentin. I was at a film festival in Siege of Spain
*  it's a science fiction fantasy film festival as a guest and
*  I was there. That's where I met Peter Jackson
*  we actually he sat next to me in a screening and we became friends and and
*  He had his movie brain dead. Have you ever seen that? No. Oh, it's really good. It's really fun
*  It's really gory but funny gory
*  And really clever
*  But anyways, when did he make that? Well, this was like in the 90s or something. I guess I I'm real bad with dates
*  you know, but anyways, we were
*  sitting and talking and and Freddie Francis who was a
*  director and a director of photography for did a lot of hammer movies and and
*  Stuart freeborn was there ever sitting in this thing and there was this big kind of goofy kid walking around, you know
*  And I thought he was just like a fan
*  So I said come on over and sit down with us, you know, we started talking and go
*  What are you doing here? And you know, he was obviously like an American he goes. I have a film here
*  you know, and it was reservoir dogs and
*  And we went to see it and I actually left in the scene where they're torturing the cop. It's funny people think I like
*  Gory gory stuff, you know because I've done it in films but real
*  Stuff and if it's really intensely done on a film like that was I mean
*  I thought he was gonna let this guy light this guy on fire
*  He's got the cop in a chair at one point and I said I can't I don't want to see this
*  So I left and so did Wes Craven. Well, yeah, and we went
*  And he got so jazzed by that, you know
*  Wes Craven couldn't take my movie and Rick Baker couldn't take my movie. It's so cool
*  It was and that was a great thing
*  I mean like I said, I was my introduction to Peter Peter Jackson and we became the best friends we kind of had
*  The same background it's like you what you said to me about wanting to be makeup artists and reading those things
*  I know so many people like that
*  You know, Danny Elfman said that to me. Oh, really? Yeah, John Fogarty likes that like that's yeah
*  I don't know they wanted to be makeup rest, but he really likes like that stuff, you know
*  Slash, you know a lot of these different people, you know, and they went into rock and roll instead of that
*  you know and
*  but you know, I I never veered off that path, I mean from
*  From age 10. This is what I wanted to do and I didn't have a plan B
*  and fortunately it worked because I I grew up very lower middle class and I wasn't in the
*  Didn't know anybody in the film industry, you know, and when I finally met somebody I was
*  13 and
*  Universal Studios just started their tour and I talked my parents. They said, you know, you're gonna be a teenager
*  It's a special birthday, you know, what can we do?
*  You know and I said, can we go to Universal on the Universal tour, you know and in my head?
*  I was gonna hop off the tram and run into the makeup department and they were gonna hire me, you know
*  But on the way I knew that
*  Are you familiar with Don Post's masks at Don Post Studios?
*  They did a Universal classic monster masks that were in the back of famous monsters and stuff
*  Okay, but they did these really high quality masks that were like $35 in the 60s
*  Which was way beyond anything I could ever afford but everybody every kid monster kid coveted those masks, you know, and he
*  His studio was in Burbank near Universal and I had seen him on TV talking about how he was buying
*  Universal so when we got close I asked my dad if he could maybe look in the phone book and
*  Maybe call up Don Post and we could go visit and they were very gracious
*  You know my dad said, you know, my son Ricky
*  Likes monsters. He makes masks and we're in close by can you come by and they said sure, you know gave me the whole tour
*  Wow. Yeah and on the wall in Don Post Studios was a picture of Bob Burns who I'd read about in my monster magazine
*  See, he's a collector and he's done some makeup. He had a mummy suit and a
*  Garello suit that he made and and had his phone number and I wrote it down and I
*  Again being I was still pretty shy and I got my dad to call this guy
*  Who I read about in monster magazines and he was the first guy I ever met in any anywhere related to the industry
*  And again very Bob and Kathy, you know, welcome me into their home
*  He told me, you know
*  I showed me how to do a scar out of a cut out of Martins wax and where to get the stuff at max factor and
*  And it just was like one of the first people to show me stuff and he worked at the local
*  CBS station and
*  Introduced me to the news
*  the guy who did the newsmen the makeup artists who made up the newscasters and
*  He was like blown away by the stuff that I did
*  He goes I'm gonna take you to the makeup union
*  And I was like 15 at this point
*  And so I went to the makeup union with a box full of heads and masks and make pictures of makeups. I did
*  again naive
*  Thinking that they were gonna say start tomorrow
*  And the business rep of the union said, you know give up kid you're never gonna get in
*  You know that you have to be born into the industry it was a real at that time at that time
*  There was a lot of nepotism. I mean, there's still that bad. Yeah, but he says, you know, if you were a Westmore
*  You know, you would get a union card with your birth certificate
*  You know, but but nobody knows, you know, no anybody you're not gonna he said first of all
*  You have to be 21 to serve an apprenticeship
*  Elvis 15
*  He said there's gonna there's only a few apprenticeships and they're gonna go to a Westmore or to a bow or you know
*  Somebody who was a name makeup artist or a relative of one of them
*  And he also said the kind of makeups that I wanted to do which were monsters and weird stuff
*  You say he said those jobs are few and far between and most of the time you're gonna be mopping sweat off of some bitchy actress
*  Mmm, and it was kind of like trying to crush your dreams
*  Well, he kind of it kind of did but it also was like, you know what fuck you I'm gonna show you
*  And and I did you definitely did I mean boy was he wrong? Yeah turned out to be the greatest of all time
*  Yeah, well, I don't know about that. I think Dick Smith is the greatest of all time. But well, you have to think that
*  Now I can't believe you didn't get the book, I'm sorry, I'm gonna make sure you get it
*  Well, there's a there's a picture of me yet. Wow, that was from a newspaper article in my local newspaper
*  When I think I was a sophomore in high school and that was the first time they called me Rick Baker monster maker
*  Yeah, that was that's from high school. That was yeah, I always think I was the third. No, I must have been like
*  14 or 15 or 16 something like that. Wow, man, you were committed to the path
*  Oh, I mean my bedroom had it was all masks and you know the roar. Did you ever do the Aurora model kids?
*  Yes, yeah, yeah
*  I mean that was one of the big regrets that
*  When I got married, I thought well, I got a grow up. Yeah, you know, which I got rid of the models
*  Regretted it ever since those were so cool. You could paint them. I remember those I think I had a I think I had a creature from
*  The Black Lagoon one did they make a creature from the yeah, yeah
*  Yeah
*  That was that was an interesting film right because that was a that was a unique turn on makeup where they took this guy and
*  They kind of put him in sort of like a scuba suit slash reptilian thing. That was one of the cooler
*  Makeup works for the time. It still is it's still the best man in the sea
*  Really well done pull that up Jamie creature from the Black Lagoon that was like was it 50s? Yeah, and it that was
*  The Westmore regime Jack Pierce who did Frankenstein the wolf man all the classic stuff was used old-school techniques
*  during the time when other people were doing foam rubber and
*  A new regime came in Universal and all of a sudden Jack got a pink slip, you know, you're you're out
*  You know these movies is yeah, very cool
*  Go with the larger one in the lower left corner Jamie where you see the whole body
*  Yeah, I mean what a cool design it is and it was designed by a woman
*  Millicent Patrick who she nailed it she did but she didn't get a lot of I mean Bud Westmore regime got the credit for
*  When the movie came out when some that yeah when some publicists found out that a woman designed it
*  It was they did a whole kind of Beauty and the Beast campaign and apparently Bud Westmore was furious, you know
*  It's my work it's you know, and he was he was famous for posing with other people's stuff, you know
*  I mean a very fine sculptor named Chris Mueller sculpted the creatures head anyways
*  And I think he did the abdomen and some of the parts and and he also
*  Sculpted the metal any mutant from this island earth, you know the big
*  Yeah, and now there's a there's some pictures of Bud Westmore
*  Holding a really inappropriate sculpture tool next to the sculptures and from what I heard he would
*  Whenever the publicist would come to take pictures
*  He let give everybody a day off or the afternoon off and then he would go up to the lab and pose with that
*  Oh Christ, I hate hearing stories
*  It's so disappointing, you know when you want to think that all these people who take credit for all that work
*  They did the work. Yeah, and I tried to do that and it's funny because you know, so many people I mean I
*  Never wanted to be businessman, you know, and I never even thought about that aspect of it
*  That I'd have to have employees and all that, you know me neither and I hated that part
*  and I mean that was something I didn't care for you know, and I
*  Resisted being a businessman. I didn't have I wasn't listed anywhere. My company wasn't listed. I didn't have a letterhead
*  I didn't have business cards
*  How the hell I I don't have didn't have an agent, you know, how the hell I ever was successful
*  I don't know other than that fact that I worked hard and my work was pretty good, you know
*  Yeah
*  Fortunately, it all worked out for me. Like I said certainly did what was your first gig?
*  Like what was the first first professional gig that you got where it was like, holy shit. I'm getting paid to do makeup
*  well, I mean the first time I ever got paid actually did I think I did a
*  makeup for a stage actor who wanted to be old and I
*  Charged him $75 and
*  Which was you know more money than I ever gotten from anything before like I said just came up with a number in your head
*  Yeah, well, I kind of somehow figured it out. You know, but
*  anyways, I I did these pieces for him and
*  He lived off that Pasadena freeway that one it has a weird right angled
*  Off ramps, you know
*  and my dad drove me there because they couldn't and I didn't drive at the time and and he actually had a makeup kit and
*  Had some hair pieces in it a bunch of stuff and he said, you know, I will trade you this
*  Instead of giving you $75. I'll give you this makeup case and with the full of this stuff and I was like
*  Yeah, that's really cool. You know, but my dad
*  Wanted to teach me, you know responsibilities and stuff and this was around the time
*  I I think I was like 16 and was gonna try to drive and he goes
*  My insurance is gonna go up and what you have to do is you have to get that money and you have to give me
*  money tip for the
*  Rate of the insurance that's going up. It's like oh man. I really want this makeup kit
*  But I mean I had amazing parents who I mean I wouldn't have been I wouldn't be who I am if it wasn't for them
*  I mean, this is cool. They supported me in my crazy decision to make monsters for a living
*  Well, they must have been so happy when it paid off though
*  Yeah
*  I was glad that they lived long enough to see that and I got to bring my parents to the Oscars a few times
*  oh, wow, and and you know, they were they were very proud and
*  And you know, it was funny because I mean I had like my mom's brother and my uncle would you know say stuff like, you know
*  When is Ricky gonna stop doing this silly stuff and do something can make a living at you know?
*  Yeah, those people but you know, my dad basically never grew up and I knew I never was going to you know
*  What was your dad? What did he do for a living? Well, he did a bunch of different things
*  He was a high school dropout because he had to help his family his mother and father, you know pay bills and
*  He had a variety of
*  Not very good jobs. He worked at Sears as a salesman. He drove a truck
*  He did stuff but he was always he was very creative and it was kind of held down in his lifetime
*  You know don't do that
*  You can't right, you know do something you can make a living serious and because of that I benefited from that
*  he supported the creativity and when I
*  I think I was a sophomore in high school
*  He decided he wanted to try to make a living as an artist and we lived on my mom's bank teller salary for
*  Number of years. He hardly made any money at all
*  But he was happy, you know and and he because I mean like I said he he supported my creativity
*  And he was really my first teacher. He he shot showed me what you could do with paint
*  He knew a little bit about sculpture, you know
*  He he was also a fan of monster movies, you know, and he he saw, you know, the freddick march doctor Jekyll and mr
*  Hyde when it came out, you know and told me all about it
*  That was a movie that they didn't have on TV that I really wanted to see you know, and he said
*  When he saw it in the theaters, you know, he wouldn't hide his eyes or hide by the seat
*  You know, and I so wanted to see that and and he also said, you know war of the worlds the George Powell
*  Oh, yeah, you know go that was so cool and the sound effects were great
*  and you know that was never on either and when I was in the seventh grade, I think it was I
*  Decided to get on the student council for the main reason
*  My plan was I suggested that we could raise money for the school by having showing movies after school
*  We could rent 16 Miller movie 16 millimeter movies and show them and charge admission
*  And I basically just went through all the movies
*  I hadn't seen that I wanted to see and got those you know, and there were maybe four or five people that showed up
*  To see him, but I was happy
*  Yeah, what was the first film that you did special effects for first film was a film called the Octoman?
*  And it's kind of a cult classic because it's such a crappy movie, you know, it was shot in ten days
*  At it all at Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park
*  Yeah, here was this night. Let's see. I graduated from high school in 1969 and I went to two years to a junior college
*  71 I guess it was so you went from that to Star Wars only like five or six years later, right? Yeah, something like that
*  Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah and King Kong and
*  There's Octoman
*  I didn't design. Oh my goodness. Look at that thing. Yeah, but I mean this was I was a full-time student
*  I had six weeks and like I think a thousand dollars to make this suit and
*  So I after school I and I got my friend the very first job
*  I ever had actually this and this again happened because of my dad when he was a truck driver
*  Delivering plumbing supplies he went to the wrong building in the building
*  He went into was called cloak e productions and they made Gumby and Davy and Goliath stop-motion animation
*  Which I did stop motion as well big Ray Harryhausen fan, you know
*  and
*  For some reason I grew up in Covina which is east of you know
*  LA like 30 or 40 miles and wasn't and there wasn't anything film related out there
*  But for some reason Cloakies was out there. I think because it was cheaper rent and
*  He I was my quarter-a-week allowance when I found a place I could buy rubber it was like eight
*  Almost nine dollars for a quarter rubber
*  And you know took me a lot of weeks and a lot of mow and lawns and a lot of stuff to save up that money
*  And I said I need to I need a job
*  So I I didn't have a car we only had one car in the family and you know
*  I went to any place I could walk to
*  Supermarkets, you know bus boys all this stuff. Nobody wanted me and
*  My dad said why remember this place and did stop motion and you stop motion, you know, maybe so I went there with my box
*  of stuff, you know
*  And and it was summer vacation between my junior and senior year high school and they said start tomorrow
*  Got paid minimum wage, which I think was you know a dollar 25 or something at the time
*  But that place was like a magnet for any weird kid or any kind
*  It was like a stop-motion fan any stop-motion person would show up there at one point or another
*  And I met this guy named Doug Bezwick who was a few years older than me
*  And we became again fast friends, you know, red famous monsters
*  He was a very Harryhausen fan and Doug when I did this this Octoman film Doug had a
*  Little workshop and we did it in his workshop and we did it together
*  but yeah, it was a and it was a real introduction to the film industry because it was the very first days filming a
*  Filming in Bronson Canyon Griffith Park, we show up we went and Doug's 57 Chevy had Octoman in the backseat
*  you know, and and we show up there and
*  Looking around and there's nobody there and I go what the hell, you know
*  So and this is you know before cell phones and all that shit
*  So we'd have to go we went back down the hill down Bronson Canyon to like there was a market there and I got a
*  Payphone called the production office and it was like, oh, yeah, we pushed one day. We just forgot to tell you, you know
*  Movie called the Octoman
*  You forgot to tell the people who were making the Octoman the title character of the movie that you weren't filming
*  You know and it was also I mean they that's a perfect introduction to the movie industry though
*  Oh it was and and I learned that that you know, you can't believe anything they tell you, you know
*  I mean it was designed by somebody else and I
*  Got this job handed down through people. I met at Cloakies. It was gonna be stop-motion at one point
*  they decided that was too expensive they're gonna make a suit and
*  first thing I did was a little maquette and a little what maquette a small sculpture of the design, but I said there's
*  Because he had they tried to figure out how they could do eight tentacles on a man
*  You know and his feet kind of like turned into tentacles and it kind of split off and into a back tentacle
*  But I said, I think they look like elf shoes and it's not a good way for me to join the two things together
*  And it's like kid. Don't worry about it
*  There's only gonna be one shot of the Octoman in the movie where you actually see it
*  The rest of the time is just gonna be a shadow or a glimpse, you know
*  But we'll have a money shot where you can you know, make sure it looks great
*  The movie starts out with a close-up of his feet, you know basically, you know and and you know, it was
*  It was a real introduction I I thought it was gonna be like working on eight millimeter millimeter movies like I did as a kid
*  You know, right just jumps in and we're making a movie. Let's do it. You're right
*  Yeah, wasn't that the DP the director of photography because I had long hair and
*  Doug had long hair. He called us the girls. This was at a time when
*  Get the girls to get their silly monster suit out, you know
*  But we there was a
*  if you can believe this
*  The Octoman was written by the guy who was the writer of creature in black lagoon and he also wrote
*  It came from outer space
*  so it was basically those two scripts combined with ever with ecology thrown in and
*  he
*  We you know, it was like
*  There's this day where that instead of in you know in the creature
*  They they put a log across the the lagoon and they can't get out, you know here
*  It was a log across the street and they're driving in Winnebago and they can't get out
*  They get out to try to get the log out and they open the Winnebago door and the Octomans in there and
*  he knocks a guy down and then they
*  supposed the other guy supposed to pick up the log and throw it at the Octoman and I go, you know,
*  where's the prop log that we're gonna use and and and you know, he goes was that it's that and I go that's it's a
*  Treelim, you know, I got it. That's gonna hurt the guy in the suit and it's gonna hurt the suit
*  You know and I go and we we're gonna rehearse this right?
*  We don't have time to rehearse it and I go what oh when he the Octoman supposed to bend over and pick up the
*  Pyrangeli who was the female lead who killed herself after this movie?
*  Can tell you how good the movie was, you know
*  So when he goes to pick her up, let's cut there because if you cut I can wrap the tentacles around her
*  No, look more like he's holding her, you know, so anyways, they start filming without rehearsing
*  Octoman opens the door knocks a guy down guy picks up a log throws at the Octoman hits him rips the suit
*  He goes walking over he's virtually blind. He's looking out of two little holes out this far away
*  You know is it was a real claustrophobic suit the poor guy Reid Morgan who played the Octoman was great to deal with but it
*  Was very hard suit to wear goes to pick up here. Angeley. Nobody says cut so he picks her up
*  So walking around the guy who knocked on the ground is laying on the ground spread eagle
*  He ends up stepping right on his nuts. Oh
*  Falls over backwards throws Pyrangeli against the
*  Winnebago. Oh, she's crying says he wants her mother that guy's holding her nuts
*  You know, I broke his hand because a log fell on his hand and everybody's screaming. I'm going to rip my suit
*  And we lost a day out of our 10-day shooting schedule. So Harry Essex who was the director and writer
*  Was tearing pages out of the script like this in just we don't need this. We don't need this
*  And then when they tried to make a movie out of it it made no sense
*  I mean, I think if the first 20 minutes are stock footage, you know in the beginning
*  There was nothing and then you know, then there was slime and then you know, the whole I can't wait to watch
*  There's a I think it's in public domain now, I think it's on YouTube but there's a blue ray out of it
*  Yeah, I might have to fire up a joint watch that one now when you when you look back on that
*  You mean it's gotta be kind of even though it sounds like a clusterfuck. It seems like it's kind of a fond memory as well
*  Because that was where it started it was you got to see how much nonsense there is in the movie industry
*  But you also got a chance to get going
*  Yeah
*  And and I got you know, we we came up with a way to do this because we couldn't
*  It's a foam rubber suit and foam rubber has to be baked in an oven. We didn't have a big oven
*  we didn't have the means so we we came up with a clever solution and
*  It's what I had to do so many times in films do things that people hadn't done before and a budget and schedule
*  You know and and try to figure out and that's part of the fun
*  You know, but what was cool about the Octoman the male lead was Kerwin Matthews who was Sinbad in the seventh voyage of Sinbad
*  I get a Ray Harryhausen film and I was a big fan of you know, so
*  One of the first things I had to do there's a scene where the Octomans tentacles was to creep through this cave
*  opening and they basically
*  Wadded up some tar paper and I stood behind the tar paper in bronze and caves and stuck my hand in this tentacle and did it
*  Did this and when Kerwin walked by I said super dynamation
*  Which is what Ray Harryhausen's technique he called for a few films and he goes, oh, you know about that, you know
*  So I thought that was really cool. My kids found out about Harry Hills and from Monsters, Inc
*  Uh-huh, and they were like, who's that? Who's Harryhausen?
*  Yeah, and I said well, he's the guy that made all the early monster movies
*  And so then we sat down and we watched King Kong together and they were scared at first. Oh my god
*  I'm scared but they started laughing when they saw King Kong the stop motion
*  Yeah, I mean it's it's today in comparison to you know
*  even comparison to your version of King Kong when you could you know make it mechanized and you know, it's just
*  It's it's amazing when you think about how far we came
*  But you know the yes the stop motion and and Harry hasn't didn't animate on King Kong. He did mighty Joe Young
*  But King Kong is what inspired him that was Willis O'Brien and and Pete Peterson who were the animators on that?
*  He did the was the
*  The one the one with Medusa. Did he do that one Harryhausen? Yeah, yeah clash of the titans. Yeah, right
*  That was him right? Well again and Ray was a one-man show, you know and stop motion, you know
*  It's 24 frames a second
*  You move all himself all himself and when you're animating seven skeletons Jason the Argonauts are seven skeletons fighting seven guys
*  He did all that himself himself and I became I became friends with Ray
*  And I would say to him and and this was during the time when computer stuff was starting out, you know
*  And you know his movies were fifty thousand dollar movies, you know, you know the whole budget of the movie
*  You know not just as facts in the early ones that he did, you know, and I said, you know
*  Doesn't it piss you off that now?
*  They get millions of dollars and there's hundreds of people working on stuff that you did by yourself, you know
*  And well, they could never take away his legacy though. You know, even though he did it all but him he was
*  Not just a groundbreaker but
*  He's the guy when you think about stop-motion films and horror films
*  He's the guy that you think of and you've pulled up Jason in the Argonauts skeleton scene
*  I can't believe he did that all himself because that's a very very detailed and intricate scene
*  No, cuz you have to match what they're doing. Yeah
*  I mean and you know, you're in a room by yourself and you know moving up, you know fraction of an inch a puppet at
*  A time, you know and it takes forever, you know, and I mean having if you've never done stop motion appreciate it. Yeah. Oh
*  My god, what year was this?
*  I'm not sure exactly and look they pop out of the ground. Yeah
*  It's a great Bernard Harriman music in this, you know, he always had the
*  Terrific scores in his in his films as well, you know, and again, he was a fan
*  He knew who made a living doing something that he loved, you know
*  And imagine being the actors and having to sort of respond to all this
*  Yeah to these skeletons that are popping out of the ground with shields and swords which aren't there which
*  Which you know came, you know months later. Yeah. Okay, you've seen the skeleton now. Yeah, you're scared
*  He's going to take your soul
*  Well Ray would kind of direct those scenes because that most directors don't know what to do with that kind of sure, you know
*  Yeah, but he was you know what I thought was great about Ray is like so many
*  Artists, you know aren't appreciated till after they're gone, you know Ray
*  Saw the impact he had. I mean I went to his 90th birthday celebration in in England
*  Where the British Film Academy did this great tribute to Ray and everybody showed up
*  I mean Peter Jackson came, you know people who didn't show up sent video Steven Spielberg sent a video
*  Jim Cameron did all talking about how much Ray's films and Ray's work influenced them and it was really great
*  you know and and I it's so nice that he was able to be appreciated like that in his lifetime and and now I'm actually
*  I mean the funny thing is I'm getting that now with this with my book that's come out people are just going
*  Oh my god, you're I love you so much and the stuff you've done. It's just you know, it's nice to know that
*  You know, I served a purpose in my life
*  You served a giant purpose and you served a big purpose in my life man
*  Like I said, I'm such a huge fan of your work and when you look back
*  What was the first thing that you did where you like? Okay, that was a good one
*  Well, you know, it's funny once you do something and you look at it
*  You see all the things are wrong with it, you know
*  And and I always say I wish I could see the film before I make this stuff because so many times the thing that's supposed
*  To be the most important thing just isn't and something that you like threw together is all of a sudden the most important thing
*  I mean I I mean American werewolf was probably the one where I mean
*  That's one that really put me on the map. I mean a lot of people say King Kong was but
*  American werewolf, you know, I looked at it and I thought well, that's pretty cool, you know, but I also went god
*  I wish we did this and I wish I do you know didn't do that, you know
*  And I see so many things that I would do differently now movies a masterpiece. Well, it's a great film
*  It's a great film. I mean and I my second film was schlock, which was John Landis's first film
*  And I was 20 and he was 21 and I had again I think I had six weeks and I think I had a thousand dollars
*  Again to make John played the schlock throppes. I don't know if you've ever seen schlock. No, I never saw that's another one
*  You're gonna watch
*  Low budget, you know movie shot by a kid basically, you know
*  With it, you know, and he like I said, he played this it was based
*  Have you ever seen trogg? Yes, Joan Crawford. Yeah. Yes. He saw trogg and couldn't believe that they made this movie
*  So he was making like a joke a joke version of schlock, you know
*  And
*  He wanted to play this ape man character and it's like well
*  Okay, you know, but you're gonna be the director too. So, you know, he had to be on set at six in the morning
*  Whether schlock worked or not all made up, you know, and it was shot in three weeks and John and I were going on two
*  Hours sleep a night, you know, he I would make him up we were out in a Gura
*  Where it used to be an Oakwood school where John went for a while on think it was thrown out of
*  And we lived and worked in this like screened in patio
*  that was left over in this dilapidated building and I was making up John on a bar stool and
*  Eventually, he was like falling asleep and doing those, you know that thing, you know, and I'd have to grab him
*  But he for some reason they were doing the dailies at MGM so we would have to go from after
*  12 hour day of filming and you know an hour removing the makeup we'd get in the car drive to MGM
*  Look at the previous day's dailies drive back sleep for two hours get up start again
*  Oh my god, and it was during a heat wave in a girl and the first day John
*  Had the suit on all day and I was like calming it and brushing it and the hair was just falling out in handfuls
*  And I went oh my god, and then my my second film of my career is over
*  And I would stay not all night with a hairdryer trying to dry the suit out so I could glue more hair on it
*  You know
*  But it's it's it's actually kind of a cool makeup and in in in kind of a fun character, you know
*  And John had already written American Werewolf and he said my next film is gonna be an American Werewolf
*  He wrote that by the time he was 21. He was 20 when he wrote it Wow
*  And he goes it's gonna be my next film and he said I want to do a transformation in a way that never been done
*  before it doesn't make sense to me that a
*  Man changing in his body going through this metamorphosis
*  Would sit in a chair like Lon Chaney jr. And be still until he finished changing because I think it would be painful
*  And I want him to be able to move and I want to show the pain and you know, how would you do that?
*  I think I have no fucking idea, but I would love to you know, because we both love those. Yeah transformation scenes
*  You know, just pull that transformation scene up there. The initial transformation scene is so fucking awesome
*  Because I remember seeing it in the theater what year was this
*  1981 okay, so I was 14 years old I was in high school and I remember seeing this in the movie theater and this was
*  Another one that sort of cemented the idea that I wanted to be a makeup artist when he pulls all his clothes off
*  He's burning up and then he looks at his hand his hands start stretching out like that was incredible
*  Well, this was just such a different werewolf to like everything about it was different. Yeah
*  Well again and I credit John for that and he also said, you know, I want to do it in a brightly lit room
*  It's not gonna have horror film lighting. It's gonna be real, you know, how did you do this?
*  How did you do this? We call it a change-o hand. It's actually a fake hand. We storyboarded the whole sequence and that's a different fake hand
*  There that's a second one. Right and that's another one there. It's got syringes in it that we pump it now
*  He's wearing an appliance hand that matches that
*  And we storyboarded the whole sequence and as you saw when David first talked of his clothes, he's not very hairy
*  right and I said for me to
*  Glue a little bit of hair on and then we do him a little hairier and a little hairier
*  It's better for us to work in reverse. Let me do him into hairiest first now pull hair off and trim it
*  Interesting. Yeah, but we boarded the whole thing out. So in this hair growing was reverse
*  I punched hair through rubber and then pulled it through and we've reverse printed it. So look
*  This is a whole fake back again with things coming out of it
*  So you punched hair through rubber and pulled it through and then reversed it
*  But what I
*  We thought what would be the most impactful thing would be for his face to change last
*  But what I don't like about the transformation like here the wolf has a big mane of hair
*  So he's got this big hairy neck that I don't like, you know, and it's you know
*  That's David doesn't have lenses and his eyes were just a red from that was a ten hour day of makeup
*  So just exhausted. Yeah makeup on yeah, this was incredible man. That's crazy that he doesn't have any eyes
*  He doesn't have anything in his eyes. That's just his eyes. Yeah, holy shit
*  But yeah, this is the first stage change-o-head. So this is a rubber head that had mechanisms that push it out, you know
*  And this is a second stage change-o-head
*  It just stretches out like that and the thing that was interesting because I mean I I was 30 when I did this
*  It was at a time when there weren't people that did this kind of work
*  There just a few in Hollywood, you know, like John Chambers who did Planet of the Apes
*  But for me to find a crew I hired
*  Kids that sent me fan mail
*  I was a kid a kid from Texas that sent me fan mail another kid from Connecticut and they were like 18
*  Wow, I mean I had a crew of like basically 18 year olds and me it was like I think six of us
*  Who did this film, you know 30 however many years ago. I'm not good at math
*  And still looks pretty decent fucking awesome not just pretty decent
*  I mean, there's a reason why I have the American Werewolf the Pat McGee version of it's sitting there in the front
*  Yeah, but now I have to call Pat and tell him the legs are off. What's wrong with the legs?
*  They're too stretched out and too long it
*  You know, we actually that was a problem because I didn't know how I was gonna make this four-legged wolf work
*  Yeah, and I thought well figure out something and it came to me one night
*  I thought I remember as a kid
*  You ever do that wheelbarrow race thing where somebody holds your feet you're walking on your hands, you know
*  I thought well if we do something like that and have like puppeteered legs in the back
*  So if the reality is if you really see the full wolf, there's feet sticking out of his ass. He's got
*  Two legs sticking out but we had him like on a platform with wheels and the back legs were puppeteered with little rods
*  You know, so I never you know, they're back in the back legs come in. That's when you cut, you know, right?
*  Right, right
*  And a lot of the stuff like in Piccadilly Circus in the big bus crash and yes
*  That's me in a wheelchair with a with a head which John pushing me down the street Wow
*  You know a great scene god. That was a great scene
*  Yeah, well and werewolf comes bursting out of the the porno theater. Yeah, which the guy in the head that script
*  I think was the only script that I've worked on in my entire career that
*  The script that I read was basically the script we made the only difference was when John wrote the script originally
*  That arrows that cinema in Piccadilly Circus was a cartoon cinema
*  Original script is a cartoon cinema, but when we got there, it was a porno cinema
*  So he changed that scene, you know to a porno cinema other than that
*  It's the same the script is basically verbatim when he wrote as a 20 year old and his use of music and everything was groundbreaking
*  At the time people didn't do like the way he did, you know and his friend that kept returning
*  Jack more more and more rotten every time like that was a genius idea as well
*  Like that Jack had explained to him like hey, man, you got to kill yourself
*  You're a werewolf. You're gonna kill a bunch of people like it was so everything about it was so unique
*  It was a it completely flipped the whole idea of what a werewolf movie was on its head
*  Yeah, and and it worked, you know and Griffin who played Jack
*  When I first made him up in that makeup
*  He as I was putting the stuff on you know in the makeup chair
*  He's kind of like getting more and more sad and like sinking down in the chair and and it's like what's wrong Griffin?
*  Something wrong and he goes look at me. Yeah
*  Look at me. This is my big break. And I mean, I mean my throat's torn out
*  And I mean nobody's gonna look at me, you know, and it's like did you read the script? Yeah
*  Didn't say your throat was torn out. Yeah
*  But I didn't I didn't think it would look like this and you go I did
*  That's what John thought it should be was bummed down
*  Well, he was at first, you know, because it is it's disturbing to see you know, but it's a great role
*  Yeah, I don't know and he was brilliant and and he he was terrific to work with you know
*  But the initial shock of seeing himself torn up right was it was hard for him to take you know, so realistic
*  Yeah, but but he would you know, I thought okay. I got a call John was in England
*  already scouting locations and
*  So I said, you know, you got to talk to Griffin. He's you know, kind of upset about what he looks like, you know
*  But you know, I took that opportunity
*  Being the sensitive guy that I am to tell him that the third part of his
*  Transformation was it was actually gonna be a puppet
*  It wasn't really gonna be him because he was supposed to become basically a talking skeleton, right?
*  You know and the makeup process is an additive process and and you know, he would have to be a huge
*  Skull to look right, you know, and he wasn't too happy about that either
*  But I said but I want you to operate the mouth because you're doing the lips sink
*  You know, you're you're doing the voice and you you know, so he operated a puppet
*  But he he turned out to be a great guy, you know, and and and he I thought he was brilliant in the film and
*  The whole film, you know, the film's amazing and it's funny too. That's one of the things that's interesting about the film
*  it's like it's silly but horrific like the violence and the the
*  Explosive scenes of the werewolf are ripping people apart. But then some of it is hilarious
*  Well that whole sequence in the porno theater with all the dead people a bloody pipe
*  I mean when we were when we were filming it, I was kind of going
*  Funny
*  Yeah, it was a welcome sort of comic relief from the the graphic horror of the the werewolf tearing people apart
*  Yeah. Yeah, and you know, it's I think it's a brilliant film. It's a brand phone and it changed my life
*  I mean I got my first Oscar for that film, you know, and and I mean so fortunate to me that that
*  John came into my life and this this happened again because the Donpo studios that I talked about or I they made the Halloween masks
*  John was a mailboy at Fox for a while and he knew John Chambers
*  He would deliver mail to the John Chambers who did the Planet of the Apes makeup
*  And he talked to John Chambers at first about doing schlock and John said well
*  I need you know, $250,000 in the budget the whole film. I think was $30,000, you know, so
*  I think he basically didn't want to deal with this hyperactive kid, you know
*  So he sent him to Donpo studios and Don Post
*  You know said well same thing and they didn't really want to deal with his kid and and they had it would be way too much money
*  You know, right, but they said there's a kid who comes in here and buys materials
*  I used to go there to buy materials because in those days now there's stores that sell all the supplies that you need
*  Right that I used to have to drive all over California to get what I need and some stuff
*  They would only sell you in a 55 gallon drum, which I couldn't afford, you know, like polyurethane
*  Polyurethane foam which is a two-part form that foams up chemical reaction foams it up make cyanide gas when it forms
*  Which nobody told me, you know, but Don Post would you know pour some in a can you go? Here you go kid
*  You know, first time I used it in my bedroom. I
*  Practically died. Really? Yeah, and I have a real strong
*  I it I have a very strong allergic reaction to it now and it because of that. Yeah Wow
*  Yeah, I mean my throat closed up. I could hardly breathe and whoa and it didn't know what was going on
*  And I found out what it was but Don cyanide Jesus
*  Yeah, but because of that because I left that that's the only time in my life
*  I actually had a business card and John says, you know, it said Rick Baker Monster Maker
*  But I think it's a Rick Baker makeup artist, you know
*  But I gave a card and some pictures to Don Post and when they were trying to get rid of this kid who wanted a funky
*  Gorilla suit thing, you know, they said well this guy's made some gorilla suits. Why don't you talk to him?
*  And John lived in Westwood near the cemetery there the veteran cemetery. He drove out to Covina
*  And again, I was still pretty shy at that point in my bedroom at that point was you know
*  I had I slept on a convertible sofa because I had gotten enough money to buy one
*  So I could fold it up and have more floor space to work
*  but my masks and my had more tables everywhere, you know, and and John is very loud and and and and and
*  Hyperactive and and he was coming in and he was flipping out over the stuff that I made
*  You know and like touching it and stuff and I'm going
*  Like this guy's in my room he's touching my stuff and he's really scaring me
*  But I mean, thank God I mean American werewolf, you know put me on the map and I mean I I
*  Did coming to America and my introduction to Eddie Murphy was you know big and I did a lot of films with Eddie and
*  Because of John actually met my wife Sylvia on a John Landis film
*  Where he had me play?
*  originally, it was a
*  Jesus Freak it was a film called into the night and it was all filmed at night
*  And we've and met my wife on Hollywood Boulevard in front of Frederick's of Hollywood
*  In the middle of night and it turned out I mean change it to a dope dealer
*  I was playing a dope dealer and Sylvia was the hairstylist on the film and John came in and says I want you to be
*  In the movie. I want you to play the part you were born to play a hooker
*  You know, so my wife was a hooker in the background, you know
*  And there's a picture of us it's in the book actually on the night we met in front of Frederick's of Hollywood
*  that's cool and you know now we have two amazing children and and
*  And a great life and you know, I owe John a lot. Well you and John made magic
*  He really did mean that that movie was so good, you know
*  And as we said one of the things about that film is it was so strategic in its use of the werewolf
*  You know that you you'd really when you got a chance to see it
*  Like one of my favorite scenes was when the guy the businessman is in the subway
*  He's running away from the werewolf and you know, it's chasing him, but you don't see it
*  You don't see it until he's stumbling on the escalator and then you see it at the bottom of the escalator
*  Just first walking into the frame just walking in the frame and you're like fuck
*  Yeah, and they cut right before you see his feet sticking out of his ass
*  Yes, well that was the thing with the design of the werewolf as well because because John said he wasn't gonna show it. I
*  Normally you would when you do something that's gonna be an animatronic character
*  Kind of sculpted in a neutral position and you let the mechanism
*  make the expressions but
*  From my experience in other films the editor doesn't necessarily choose the moment where you think it's the best expression
*  You know, and I thought if it's only gonna be on for a second
*  I want it to be scary looking so I sculpted in a scary expression on it, which I normally wouldn't do
*  So I just so there was no way that it wasn't gonna look scary. We saw it right right snarling
*  Yeah, was that was that the case with the Cantina scene in Star Wars because the Star Wars scene
*  there's that's that's a crazy scene because you've got so many characters in that scene and
*  Today when you go back and look at it like it's pretty cheesy
*  Masks. Yeah. Yeah. Well I
*  that came about
*  Originally the you know film was done in England. Nobody knew Star Wars was gonna be Star Wars
*  You know Stuart Freeborn was the makeup artist in the film. He did the Wookiee
*  He did the Cantina scene originally but George wanted to embellish on it and didn't like a lot of the stuff that he did
*  So at ILM which was in Van Nuys then
*  Industrial light magic when it first started the guys that were doing the visual effects were for that for Star Wars
*  My friends that I met at Cloakies Dennis Murin and Ken Ralston were were shooting the special effects and George came in and said
*  Do you know anybody that can make a mask because I knew I want to add some masks to the to the Cantina scene and they
*  Do so they called me and so I went over to Valgian Avenue in George on a flatbed editor showed me the sequence as it
*  Existed and I was flipping out and was like what a cool idea to have this bar full of aliens, you know
*  I go let's do you know, let's do we could do one that has like, you know, like that's kind of like a
*  Alien pirate that's got a like alien parrot character and this stuff he goes. Well, we don't have any money, you know
*  It's like, you know, we've already spent the money, you know, we don't have a lot of money for this. I just want masks
*  You know and I said well, you know what I have a bunch of stuff
*  I made myself for fun that we can throw in there that there's a devil guy that I made that
*  Five years before Star Wars, you know, there's a werewolf guy and another guy with glowy eyes. I made those before Star Wars
*  I just said you can use them. I thought they were gonna be stuck in the background, you know
*  But we did like the Cantina band, you know
*  The first the first aliens that you see almost all the first aliens you see are the ones that we did
*  I think we did 30 and
*  But what was great is yeah, that was one of the masks I made before he's good
*  Jamie's the best. Yeah
*  Yeah, that was such a great scene too though
*  These are Stuart freeborn's things, you know, but the thing that's great the Cantina band was never there and
*  When you see the movie you think it's there and I've used it so many times where I say
*  Can we shoot this like in post-production? That's the devil guy
*  Yeah, and these guys were the guys that we one of the guys some of the guys we see shot the alien band and post
*  Yeah
*  and in Los Angeles in a by different people at a different time and
*  I've said to you know, I when I say to people let's can we shoot this in post and because what happens
*  You know, most directors don't like dealing with this shit, you know
*  And they'll put it off to the last shot of the day and then it's like well
*  You got 45 minutes and I go but this is the money shot, you know
*  And I prepared for months for this and you're giving me 45 minutes to do this. It's not right, you know
*  Let's shoot it in post-production. Well, that'll never work. He'll never match. It's like did you see Star Wars? Yeah, you know the band
*  That's in the Cantina. Yeah, that was shot by different people in a different country
*  Months later. Did you know that no, you know, it's like you think they're there you hear the music that they're playing through the scene
*  you know, these are some of our aliens those two guys the blue guys and
*  As is that werewolf
*  That was the only one that looked like a mask. Well, yeah, I mean I think I think they all look like masks
*  We made that guy and that mask in the background was one of mine that I had before too, you know
*  But yeah, you know great scene again. It was a great idea and people I did not make that one. That was on Stewart's
*  People think of it fondly, you know, and it's more that it's a great idea than the work is great. Yeah. Well, it was it was a great
*  Conglomeration of cool characters all in one bar and you you know
*  At the time it was completely unique and new things. Oh, yeah
*  and but after that every movie every space movie had a Cantina scene, you know, and and and
*  It's like American werewolf to every transformation after American werewolf was basically the same transformation. They did the same things, you know
*  And it happened on thriller too, you know, I mean I because of American werewolf when
*  Michael came to John Landis to do thriller, you know, he liked American werewolf and he wanted to do
*  He wanted it to be a short film you didn't want to call it a music video
*  Mm-hmm, and John contacted me and said, you know, Michael Jackson wants to do this America werewolf like music video, you know
*  For the song thriller which I hadn't heard, you know, it was like, you know, Michael Jackson little Michael Jackson Jackson five
*  Yeah, you know, he's not called that anymore, you know
*  And so he goes Johnson's I'll send you a cassette and listen to it and get some ideas, you know
*  So I and this was when we had little Walkman, you know, and yeah, I'd listen to it with one
*  I had another one that I would like like free associate ideas when I was listening, you know, and
*  You know it was like
*  this I thought well these we came up the idea doing these zombie dancers and
*  And I said well, you know, I'm sure you're gonna hire the dancers way in advance so they can learn the dance and stuff
*  And he goes no they they they're they only need like a couple of days
*  So they hired him like three days before we filmed and they went I can't that doesn't give me time to take life masks
*  Do all the stuff that I would do and these zombies should be really cool, you know
*  So I said, how about if the first zombies you see are like me and my crew because we already have life masks
*  We can start those today and we can spend the time and making some cool
*  So I'm in Thriller coming out of a crypt like this, you know
*  And all my crew basically are the first guys that come out of the ground and break through windows
*  but the dancers I said I'll figure out a way we can do them and I
*  Because I had a number of life masks the different people and small medium a large male small me a large female and we sculpted
*  We kept pieces. We called like bandit masks. They were kind of like this around this area like a bandit in a
*  Run guys like a raccoon mask. Yeah, and it didn't have the nose on it because you know proportionally you could get away with more
*  so we had
*  Different sculptures of small medium large male small male large female that we've to say
*  Okay, you're a medium male number two and we made these big teeth that we could pop in their mouth and put some denture lining
*  Material and fit them so the dancer makeups were not as good as the more featured makeup
*  But my Michael in the upper left hand corner that one Jamie were the eyes. Yeah, look at that
*  Like that was excellent. And again, we kept it that way
*  But what happened is the zombies after that everybody was just doing pieces like this
*  I only did it like that because the limitations I had
*  But that was I mean that was another really quick job
*  in very little money
*  Thriller was very little money for me
*  It turned I mean they spent the money they had a lot of cameras and a lot of stuff when they're filming
*  But it I was working day and night every day of the week to get this stuff done and John
*  Didn't surprise me with the making of thriller on the day that
*  Michael was coming out for us to take his life mask and make a cast of his face
*  He goes others like I'd be a camera crew here a couple cameras and what are you talking about?
*  He goes I want to do a making of and I go I'm just going no
*  It always looks horrifying to see if somebody having a life mask taken right and I go I don't need and Michaels really shy
*  I don't need we don't need this. I don't I don't want this he goes shut up. We're doing it
*  You know, it's like fuck, you know, I was not happy about it
*  But then so many people have come up to me
*  Who are makeup artists now and go the reason I'm a makeup artist because I saw the making of thriller
*  And inspired me to do this, you know, and my stock answer is
*  You thought that if this idiot could do it I can do it
*  There was a time where
*  Music videos were a new thing and then thriller changed what a music video is it it was so huge
*  It was a world premiere event that was on MTV and it's so hard for kids today to understand what that means
*  But we were all like gathered around the TV
*  Waiting for the Michael Jackson thriller world premiere and it premiered and it changed what a music video is
*  then all of a sudden it became this film and it was really cool cuz like Michael Jackson was this sweet guy and he's on a
*  Day with this beautiful girl and and the next thing you know, he's a fucking were cat or whatever
*  He was was that supposed to be a cat like what? Yeah, I
*  He wanted to be a werewolf and I just thought you know
*  I don't think he should be a werewolf and I thought something feline would be fit him better, you know
*  And I originally did a like a black panther and then I was afraid of the black panther
*  You know that I didn't want him to be associated with the black panthers, you know what I mean the political. Yeah. Yeah
*  So I then became more fantasy
*  I gave it longer hair and like white stream see if you find his transformation to the cat
*  Because it was reminiscent and somewhat of American American were all but cool and unique in its own way
*  I think we didn't we didn't have the time to yeah. Yeah, I wasn't sure what it was
*  I was like, is that a cat? Is it a werewolf? Is that a yeah?
*  Call the werewolf sometime people call the cat. I said, you know, yeah, I just you know, thought it was cool looking
*  You know, it was definitely cool looking whatever it was, but you know what happened?
*  I mean on the trailer was like work work work work work and originally it was gonna be
*  My my crew were gonna be the guys that do the makeups and they were all non-union and at the last minute became a
*  Union production so I had to hire union makeup artists and there were many to do the dancers and many of them
*  Were people I didn't know and there weren't a lot of people that were good at this stuff. Hmm
*  Yeah, that's gonna be a little bladders in his hand. There's actually an American werewolf hand in here at one point
*  I think oh really? Yeah, yeah, that's a nail growing thing was from American werewolf
*  And then you did a similar thing with the ears. Yeah, and then he had the whiskers. Yeah. Yeah, it's like
*  Yeah, it's before his hair grew. Yeah silly, but when you look at that, like what is that? Yeah, is that a cat?
*  Whatever it is. It's cool. Yeah, but he
*  That it was an amazing experience because you know
*  I was like I said
*  I was really stressed out the day that we were filming the dancers and I was I had to make up Michael as a zombie
*  I had a number of makeup artists
*  I didn't even know and had worked before with before that were doing other zombies and I'm running through trailers going no
*  No, no, like this, you know, I'm making up Michael and it's like, oh man
*  And we were filming in Vernon downtown Los Angeles next to the Farmer John meatpacking place
*  And they just slaughtered the animals and it had this weird smell in the air
*  Oh geez and then the dance started and I
*  All of a sudden it just like this wave went over me of just the stress went away
*  And I just was looking at what was happening in front of me and it was going
*  Oh my god, look at this, you know, and and people would pay money to see this and I'm yeah
*  I get to see this, you know, I saw this little dance
*  Happening when it was, you know for the first time there, you know when it was being filmed
*  How many times did they shoot it? I not that many
*  I don't think but there I think there was six cameras on it, you know
*  The whole street, you know friend that was filled with cameras and
*  But the other thing that was so cool about it. That was one of the dancer makeups
*  That
*  Michael when we were doing in pre-production
*  Michael did a a Motown special that was on television where he moonwalked for the first time and nobody had seen the moonwalk
*  And I didn't see it
*  I was busy working and but one of my crew who went home at night and
*  Recorded it and he goes you're not gonna believe this is the same kid that was in her makeup chair the other day
*  Because Michael is very shy as well really meek and quiet in person
*  And he's so dynamic on stage, you know, and and it was he's like two different people. I mean when Michael's performing
*  He's incredible, you know
*  now he was a
*  I mean to say he was unique is the biggest understatement in the history of the world
*  Yeah, but this whole scene with him when he becomes a zombie. It was so bizarre to
*  Dancing was so strange. Yeah, you know, it was cool though. It was really cool and to see it live for the first time
*  You know out in the cold with it
*  They don't do anything like this anymore. I mean really it doesn't happen. Yeah. Well, you know, it's funny
*  I like you you've said a number of times I try to explain to my daughters that you know, we we had television but you
*  I had a TV guide
*  I would look at every page and try to find when a monster movie is gonna be on and have to watch it then or
*  If I wanted to see it again, I would have to wait a year or whatever, you know, there wasn't an internet
*  You know, you know, I had I had to go to the library to find books on makeup, which there weren't very many
*  You know now you get this all these YouTube videos. I even have some you know, but yeah, it's it's a different world
*  I mean the information wasn't is available and you couldn't you know, you couldn't just call up. Let's see thriller. You know, yeah
*  Now when you did the wolf man was there a push to do some sort of CGI version of that
*  Was it did you have to like I was there a discussion about how to do it?
*  I expected that it would do it CGI because everything at that time was basically CGI and I
*  Had a friend that got a copy of the script
*  And I read it and it read like a CGI thing. Hmm, and I was actually filming at Universal
*  We were filming some of the Norbit stuff at Universal and I went to a producer there that I knew
*  Who was a visual effects producer as well and I asked him if he knew anything about the wolf man, you know
*  Because I said I'd love to do this, you know, that's one of the films that made me do what I do, you know
*  And I said is it gonna be CG and he goes no actually they were talking about it being a makeup and I go
*  Will you put my name in there that you know, I would love to do this. So
*  They the original director wanted it to be a makeup
*  and I
*  Thought we were gonna do transformation. We actually built stuff for a transformation. It was a weird film
*  in so many ways it seemed like
*  You know Benicio was great to work with he wanted he wanted to be the wolf man, you know
*  He's a monster a real monster kid too, you know
*  Anthony Hopkins was great, you know, I did it with my friends Dave and Lou Elsie
*  But I think we were the only people that wanted to be working in a movie called a wolf man
*  I mean think everybody else was embarrassed that they were working in movie called the wolf man
*  Really? Yeah, and they would do things the production manager called me into the office once and said what what is this?
*  Why are you buying all this hair? What is this hair for?
*  He goes seriously
*  Why do you need this hair and he had a big behind his desk?
*  He had a big sign said wolf man and I went and covered it up and I'll cover up the wolf part with my hands
*  I go right now we have this a man. I'm gonna make him a wolf man and I need hair for that
*  Why do you need hair because wolves have fur?
*  It's like what the fuck? I can't believe I'm having this conversation with you, you know, it goes what I mean
*  Do you need all of that hair? You know, I mean what I know it's like that through the whole movie
*  It's just so embarrassing you have to talk to someone like that
*  I know but they don't just let you do whatever you do
*  I know and you know
*  I think people who are in the industry who have to deal with this stuff all the time to
*  Think that I never have to you know, right it happens all the time, you know, and it seems like everybody has to yeah
*  And but I mean it was very frustrating but again Dave and Lou Elsie and I we we had we'd worked day and night
*  And when everybody was gone, we had the best time, you know, we're working a wolf man movie
*  You know
*  and when we first filmed the sequence in the gypsy camp where there's all these gypsies and
*  Fog and stuff is like yeah. Yeah, that was cool
*  That's what was it was very reminiscent of the old movies but like a new version of the old movies
*  With the fog and the gypsy camp and all that jazz it was really similar to the original Lon Chaney
*  Yeah, it's also a junior. Yeah, and it had kind of a hammer film
*  Feel to it too, you know, and we and Anthony Hopkins makeup was it was you know a little more
*  curse the werewolf Christopher
*  Christopher I was gonna say Christopher the uh, what's his name Oliver Reed who?
*  Had that kind of feel to it and and I mean like I said Benicio is a real big fan of
*  the horror films and and we got along great in fact
*  he would come into the makeup trailer with old monster magazines and that he bought on the internet and
*  There he is and he would quiz me on stuff, you know
*  What's this? I knew everything I knew that you know everything on every page, you know, we became we
*  Connected we bonded over that, you know the scene where he makes the transformation in the medical theater
*  Uh-huh. That was a great scene. It's all CG though. Is that all CG CG?
*  Oh, it's based on it's based a lot on ideas that I had, you know
*  Cuz I I mean what I said, you know, cuz they said well, we got to do the great transmission like American were often I said
*  American were if we had a naked man who changed into a four-legged hound from hell, right?
*  We have Benicio de Toro and we have Benicio de Toro with some hair on his face, you know and some teeth right we can't
*  The changes aren't the same. We can't stretch out his body. We can't right, you know
*  Well, we wouldn't have that same kind of feel so I said well
*  How about if we do things where his fingers twist and do uncomfortable things and stuff like that, right?
*  But we actually made a lot of stuff but it's so weird
*  I mean like the production we weren't even invited to this set when they did the transformation
*  Even though we had stuff they didn't want you to go they didn't want me there. Why is that?
*  I don't know they didn't want your input
*  You know
*  I guess even though it's a lot of the what's in there is based on some animatics that I did and some drawings and stuff
*  But it was a really weird deal. I mean, it's like we were the unwanted children in that movie
*  You know, that's so crazy for me to hear something like that
*  It's so it's stunning because I would have assumed that in my eyes
*  Your Hollywood royalty like you're the guy who made American Werewolf in London
*  You're the guy who made so many of these an incredible movies with makeup and special effects
*  I would think that they'd be pumped that you were there
*  Well, yeah, I thought that too, you know, but it wasn't the case
*  but you know, I mean I you know something interesting when I read this book that on my career I
*  Complained too much about the film industry and I shouldn't because it's been really good to me
*  I mean I like I said, it was my hobby and I made a decent living at it and I got awards for it
*  And I got free food and things, you know, and it is magic. I mean you
*  You you it's like time-traveling like working on this movie when we're in London
*  In areas that haven't changed since the 1800s and you have all these people in period costumes
*  It really is like your time travel, you know, and you get to work with some really amazing people
*  Yeah, see this is all CG really well done CG. It's really well done
*  Yeah, and and Steve Beg who was the
*  visual effects supervisor was a
*  Really great guy and he was really upset that we weren't able to do this stuff as well
*  but they I think they did a terrific job and I you know, I
*  Like CG to a degree
*  I mean, I I like the fact that it's another technique that we can use to do things that we can't do
*  In the real world with rubber, you know, right, right. I just don't like that. They do things when we can do it, you know
*  and I think a lot of it comes down to
*  Before American were wolf I would have to try to beg people to let me do something
*  I mean it was like can I put a mustache or an a scar on this guy, you know and
*  After American were if I would get scripts with stuff in it
*  I had no idea how the hell I was gonna do and like crazy crazy stuff, but they they would say to me
*  what
*  because they did a lot of interviews after American were often they said what is the
*  Material that changed that allowed you to do work that we haven't seen before and I said I got adequate time and adequate money
*  And it was the first time I had that and after that I like when I did gremlins to I had a year's prep
*  but the problem is I need answers a year before that we start filming because I need to make this stuff and
*  Usually a directors on another movie then it doesn't want you know
*  Well, eventually after I hound them and try to get an answer will give me some kind of answer
*  Which just to make me shut up, you know
*  CG all that stuff comes in post the films already made you kind of cut it together
*  They start making the stuff but this is obviously makeup that is yeah
*  So CG until transformation until he's the werewolf and then when he's the werewolf this was done in a different day
*  Yeah, well, I mean they the CG was done all in post
*  Yeah, right
*  But yeah him sitting in the chair was Benicio on the day and this is that's actually the stunt double
*  And so sometimes when he was running he was running on all fours
*  Yeah, and on in leg extensions and most of that stuff is Spencer Wilding who was our stunt double. Mm-hmm
*  There's there's some shots of close-ups this is Spencer the stunt double
*  Yeah, well that was what was weird about it is like he's running but he's got kind of like dog legs
*  Yeah, well, he's got his own. Yeah, but he's running on two legs. Yeah with dog legs. He's a biped. I get it
*  That's been easy, but it was it was a hybrid, you know of American werewolf and the original man
*  Yeah, you know the wolf man had you know, he said he stayed on his balls of his feet
*  You know, he didn't try to get that illusion of like dog legs. Oh, yeah, original one
*  Yeah, yeah
*  and you know I it's so funny because I walked like that as a kid all the time, you know, I did and would do things and
*  So could Dave Elsie
*  But when we tried to get the stunt guys or even Benicio to do it, they couldn't do it
*  They couldn't walk on their toes on the balls of their feet like that with their heels up, you know
*  I don't know, you know, and it's like how come I can do it, but it's also something a skill
*  I developed as a child
*  Now when you see a film like that and you say, you know
*  You think about all the the difficulties that you had and making it
*  Was there ever a film where they let you just go crazy just do whatever you wanted to do
*  Well pretty much American werewolf. Yeah. Well, that was the best one
*  Well, that's and and again, you know a gremlins to which I did was a film
*  I turned down numerous times my friend Chris Chris can't speak Chris. Whalers did the original gremlins and
*  I didn't basically want to copy Chris's work, right?
*  and I also knew it was a big job a lot of stuff and and they kept after me Chris was unavailable
*  I think he was doing the fly and
*  The Jeff Goldblum version. Yeah, which is amazing. I'm a Jeff was great. He should have won an Oscar
*  I mean that was one the all-time great performance. Yeah, a lot of people forgot about that move. I know he's he's brilliant in that
*  But the they said what can we do to
*  Entice you to do this movie and I go let me redesign the
*  Gremlin some I would like to make them individual characters Chris's version all the gremlins were out the same mold all the mogwains were out
*  the same mold
*  So you basically because you can't make one puppet that does everything so you have the you know
*  This puppet you have your hand and you have this puppet you have some rods on you have this puppet that does this
*  But they could be interchangeable for any any mogwai or any gremlin
*  Making them individual characters means I had to have you know, six versions of each one, you know
*  So we made hundreds of things but I said, you know if I can make them
*  Characters and change the design some I'd be more interested and then we came up with the idea of doing the genetics lab
*  Or one turns into a bat one turned into a spider
*  One turns into a vegetable gremlin. But what was great about working with Joe Dante?
*  I mean Joe is also a monster fan, you know monster kid guy so we we could communicate in that in that way
*  You know, we would say, you know, it's like an invasion of saucer man. You knew what I was talking about
*  Okay, like Barry Sonnenfeld who I did men in black with if I said that to he he going
*  I never seen a science fiction movie never saw any science. That's what he said
*  Go I said I went to see alien, but I got too scared and left
*  And my crew and men in black. Oh my god, this is gonna be a disaster, you know, and I was saying, you know
*  I don't you know, it could be a really good thing
*  He could make a really unique film and not just base it on other stuff
*  Yeah, see, you know, and I think men in black is a really great. It is. Yeah, it's really fun
*  He was he was terrific for it, you know, but at first it was a little scary, you know, but Joe
*  But you know Joe was great and he's really open to suggestions, you know, and on the first gremlins
*  They had a suggestion box. It's like what can we have the gremlins do and people would put things in there
*  So, you know, we would say how about if we do this? How about if we do that? Okay, you know, so
*  It was it was a nice collaboration, you know, and that was fun so you have some fond memories
*  Oh, no, I mean, I have a lot of fond memories and mostly it's in the pre-production time
*  I mean my crew it is hard though to not concentrate
*  It's like you have to make concerted effort to not concentrate on the annoyances and the negative parts
*  Yeah, and it is hard and especially when that's you get it every day. Yeah, but the hours, you know people don't realize
*  I mean a normal film days a 12-hour day
*  Yeah, but I you know for me an average makeup is a three and a half hour makeup
*  Then you have a 12 hour day then you have an hour removal time. Mmm, so they're very long days
*  I spent most of my career working
*  18-15 18 hour days, you know in 20 hour days and sometimes all night, you know
*  Yeah, and all day just to get this stuff done, you know, that's pre-atteral. Yeah
*  Yeah, and I you know, I'm surprised that I'm
*  You know, I guess I'm gonna be 69 in like a month and and I'm surprised I'm still alive
*  You know and and and able to walk and do stuff, you know when I think about the days standing on my feet all day long
*  Mmm, all the stuff. Well, what about the chemicals? That's the thing that I would think it's a little scary. Yeah, you know
*  and we I mean I
*  Because of my experience of like I said with a polyurethane form and yeah
*  I'm knowing that you know, this stuff is dangerous and I also had one time we the paint that I used to use to paint rubber
*  it's hard to get rubber paint to stick to rubber and
*  I found out that on the creature from the black lagoon. They made paint out of rubber cement and
*  Universal tinting colors
*  And thinned it with benzene and it was bonded rubber. So I used to paint my masks in my bedroom with benzene
*  Which is a carcinogen
*  You know
*  Atomizing it spray it through an airbrush, you know, no spray booths or anything
*  I used to have a five gallon drum of benzene that I'd wash my hands off in, you know
*  Oh my god, and then when I found out because they weren't material safety data sheets like they are now, you know
*  I found out how dangerous this stuff was I I became kind of fanatical about it, you know my shop my studio
*  I had seven spray booths
*  To take the fumes away and and make sure it was safe and I mean
*  I had I think one of the safest shop in Hollywood with this stuff because I didn't want to I didn't want to find out
*  Ten years down the line that half my crew died because of something I dealt with with me. So
*  But yeah, it's a it's a little scary, especially in the old days when we didn't know better, right?
*  Yeah, it's most people now are pretty safe with this stuff
*  What was the last film you worked on?
*  Maleficent not the one that just came out but the first one. Yeah, and
*  It was interesting I I
*  It came about because a
*  friend Tony G who was
*  Angie's makeup artist and does her beauty makeup all the time
*  she worked with me on first one the 90 professor and then we did life together and
*  She was like the department head on the Grinch on the Grinch all Christmas and Planet of the Apes the Planet of the Apes that I did
*  dealt with all the makeup artists and
*  And was really great. She's a great beauty makeup artist, but also a really great effects makeup person and she said to Angie
*  You know when when they were gonna do Maleficent she goes you have to get Rick Baker
*  He's the guy to do this, you know
*  And he's got a good aesthetic and he knows not to win to put stuff on and when not to you know
*  And and I said boy, I don't I don't
*  Women are the hardest to make up, you know
*  the
*  Especially if you do an age of makeup, you know, I don't think anyone wants to look old
*  You know, I've done some films where we do the most incredibly subtle little thing and then the actress won't want doesn't want to come out
*  The trailer because they say they look like a burn victim, you know and stuff, you know, we're in tears and and
*  I said, you know, I
*  Angie wanted appliances. She wanted rubber on her face and I was thinking I know I don't think she should have you know
*  I said what I think we can do it with the horns and maybe just ears, you know
*  But she had this very specific idea that she wanted these angular
*  Sharp
*  Yeah, so I mean the very first thing I did I I did it is I said well
*  let me just think about it and do a
*  Design what I think it should be. Mm-hmm. I did this design and then I met with Angie. She came to my studio
*  Which is now a storage facility
*  the
*  And she brought a couple of her kids in a and like a nanny kind of person in
*  Paparazzi followed her even we closed the gates and we're talking and she's telling me what she wants in one of her kids
*  Says to the nanny person thing is I want a coke in Angie was mid-sentence talking to me and she went please
*  You know and it really I like that. She was teaching her kids manners, you know
*  And that that kind of sold me right there, you know, it's like, okay
*  She's a mom too, you know and and she is incredibly beautiful to look at, you know, she's pretty persuasive in that respect
*  You know, yeah, they don't get any prettier. Yeah, they just get different. Yeah, but I mean, oh wow
*  Yeah, well you did a great job in keeping that beautiful face, but adding just a little bit of weirdness
*  Yeah, demonic weirdness with the cheeks. Yeah, and and again with the horns
*  I was saying, you know
*  maybe this is a really good case of doing CG horns and having them tracked onto her because when you have
*  Something that's that much. It's heavy isn't well, we made it really lightweight
*  It was incredibly lightweight and we spent a lot of time developing these lightweight horns that could be removable
*  So she didn't have to wear them all the time, right?
*  So they removed like at a point about this far up off of her wig
*  So I thought if they decide they don't like it we can take them off and it'd be a good
*  For tracking for CG. Yeah, but she she wanted them and she wore them
*  But so we you know, we spent a lot of time trying to make those really light figure about the wings the wings
*  I didn't do I don't I think I'm not sure even how they did that
*  I didn't go to location on filming Tony G made her up and I had a really great Dutch
*  guy who was a fan
*  Name Aryan Titan who did who put the appliances on with Tony G and and represented me on the set
*  What is that picture with the American werewolf with the hand stick? That's a Mike Hill
*  Mike Hill does these cool
*  Like wax figures, but they're silicone so he did me and he did me as a younger man, which was one of the worst ones
*  He's done
*  This was at the Academy for something but yeah
*  He I gave him the molds actually from American werewolf for the the hands and in some of the stuff
*  but he does he does these great figures and
*  Unfortunately, I and I think he even agrees the one they did of me was one of the one the less successful
*  I think it looks good. Well, it looks good, but it looks a little grim too
*  And I think part of that was my fault though
*  He wanted to do me smiling and I go, you know when I'm working I'm like, this is my concentration face, you know, and
*  But I sat for him and he had life casts and everything and but he does some brilliant stuff
*  What ever happened to the original molds and all the the original masks and stuff from the American werewolf in London the original?
*  Sculpture of the wolf. Well that sculpture gets destroyed basically when you make the mold
*  I have one of the original heads still I mean foam rubber is
*  Is basically the sap of a rubber tree that you put chemicals in to make a cure and you whip air into it to make
*  It foam and you put another chemical into make it congeal and you bake it in the oven
*  But because it's an organic material to decompose is it rots. Oh really? Yeah, and it will last through a film
*  But it usually doesn't last years
*  but it does the American werewolf the stunt head the one that I kill Griffin with on the moors and that go through the
*  Pig daily I have and it's hard as a rock it turns to like I
*  Call like grain crackers and if you touch it hard, it'll crumble into dust. Wow
*  Mine it's all hard like that, but it's not people don't touch it
*  You know, so what does Pat McGee make these out of the one our wolf is I think it's probably slip rubber and polyurethane foam
*  And that lasts a lot longer, but it will decompose
*  Start ordering another one
*  Get them to do keep it out of sunlight and keep it out. Yeah, you know, I mean it doesn't get out of the studio
*  Yeah, that's good. He'll last a long time
*  I have Bob Burns who this guy that I met when I was young has some of my original masks
*  I made when I was 13. Oh, wow, and they are still supple. You can still move them
*  I don't know how that that rubber has lasted all that time. I mean, that's pretty incredible long time
*  When anyone comes here one of the first things they want to do is take a picture with the world
*  That literally is like one of the friendly
*  Everybody and their brother has a photo like posing next to wolf or pretend the wolves biting their head or pretend they're having sex with
*  the wolf
*  There's a lot of people from behind the wall. I think I should get residuals
*  I probably should a little piece. Yeah, we'll taste something free cokes something anything
*  But that I mean that thing is it's if you had to go through like all the more the most iconic
*  Monsters in the history of films. I mean you're you're in the top two or three
*  I mean, it's right there with all of them that that werewolf was like my god
*  I mean, it's absolutely one of the most iconic monsters ever
*  Someone just on my on my Instagram just posted a picture of a tattoo a beautiful tattoo of the werewolf
*  Oh, yeah, so many people have them one guy did a cover-up tattoo. That was
*  Incredible the werewolf but they I it's funny. I may have the werewolf. I have Harry on people. I've got the grinch
*  Yeah, and some of the stuff I
*  Harry and the Henderson's yeah. Yeah
*  And that's one of the films I think still I mean when people ask me what my favorite one is I
*  Say Harry because I can look at that film today
*  I think it holds up perfectly fine
*  the only thing I think I would change is I would make his teeth a little more translucent, you know, and the ends but it
*  that was a challenging movie because he had to
*  Communicate just by his visual expressions, right and and carry the movie, you know
*  And I think he did and I think it works quite well was there is there a movie that stands out as being the most
*  frustrating like the end result
*  You know, I mean they're all frustrating to a degree, you know
*  Well, I don't know if there's one particular one. I mean I did and I don't consider this my film. I was approached
*  By Bob Weinstein to do a werewolf movie
*  Called cursed that West Craven was gonna direct and I basically turned it down and there wasn't a lot of time and
*  Bob used my own words against me apparently on a on a DVD of American werewolf
*  I said I'd love to have the opportunity to do a transformation again and do it
*  Knowing what I know now with the crew that I have now, right?
*  He goes I'm giving you that you said that you know
*  So I said to him the only way I would do this is if you don't have an opinion and West doesn't have an opinion
*  You just let me make what I think is best for this film
*  It's the only way I can make it cool in the time that you have. I can't play the change this change that game
*  You know, absolutely
*  Of course that's not the case
*  And they say that and yeah, yeah
*  And it was like change this change that change this change that and it was just like, you know
*  And you almost have to have a clause in the contract that if they do fuck with you at all
*  You could just leave and get paid I've done that you know in in one one contract
*  But yeah, it turned out that they started the film before they were really had a script and it was
*  Yeah, and it happens all the time and they it was just a mess and I never even heard of it first
*  Yeah, what's good? You didn't hear about I'm surprised
*  I'm even mentioning it because it did they shut the film down
*  And I went okay
*  I said but we were we were doing some really cool transformation stuff and it wasn't quite done and I said listen
*  If you ever think the film's gonna pick up again if you can keep a number of my people on for another month
*  We can have this transformation stuff. We'll put it in a box. It'll be ready to go. So if they disperse now
*  It's gonna be like starting again because nobody I won't necessarily get the same people, you know, right?
*  You know, I know what just put everything in a box, you know, ship it to us
*  You know if we start up again, you know, we'll figure it out. They started up again. I didn't do it
*  I was on something else someone else took over. They changed everything that I made they didn't use a lot of what I made
*  But the film has a single card opening credits as Rick Baker on it and I I spoke with Weinstein ago
*  I don't want credit for this film. It's not my film. This isn't my work anymore
*  But it would help them to have you on it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so, I mean I found that frustrating, you know
*  But you know again, I have no right to complain about this stuff
*  They don't do a lot of monster movies anymore and the number of werewolf movies you can kind of count them on one hand
*  Right. I mean you have the howling
*  Stretching yeah, we have the howling. Of course you have American Werewolf
*  You have the earlier films but this it's you know, and then you have those I don't consider them werewolf movies
*  Those what are the ones with the lady? They're underworld beckons. Yeah underworld. Yeah. Yeah, those are kind of but but they're funny
*  Watch Kate Beckinsale on a suit. Yeah, it's pretty fucking hot
*  Yeah, but they're just kind of whack the movies are kind of whack. The vampires are whack
*  It's like I don't buy any what you're selling. I don't think these are real vampires. I'm not scared
*  I don't think that's a werewolf get the fuck out of here. Yeah. Well, I'm more old-school
*  Yeah, poor movie guy and I'm not a big slasher movie guy, you know, I mean now again, I don't like I mean
*  I can't I can't watch those fights that you're those em, you have see fights really
*  I have a one of my crew Eddie Yang
*  Shout out to any great guy. Yeah Eddie was the pretty he he studied with one of the Gracie's and and
*  he was saying hey, you gotta watch this Rick and I mean these guys hit each other in the face with an elbow and
*  No, it's not for me, you know and people will send me because they think I like this stuff pictures. Oh look
*  Felt down and cut my head, you know
*  I
*  Pass out when I cut myself, you know, yeah
*  Yeah, I mean fake gore is one thing, you know, but I think it's bad that you know a movie, you know when
*  you know
*  Halloween and and and Friday the 13th and it just became
*  What's the most graphic way we can kill a teenager?
*  and
*  People become when you see, you know a guy with a you know
*  Get shoved in a knife shoved in design that people I use like cheer
*  That seems wrong to me, you know, yeah the
*  Desensitization, you know, you should be repulsed by this stuff. And I mean, I you know, I don't know
*  But it's so I mean people would think it's funny and kind of ironic coming from someone like you who's made these insane
*  Monster films like American were open London. We're just ripping guys heads off and pick a dilly-sir
*  It is monster gore, you know, and it's anything like, you know, if it's a zombie killing, you know, you're killing zombie
*  That's okay, you know, that's not real, you know, right?
*  But just killing a person it another person killing a person in a graphic way, right? I'm not fond of you know, so I
*  Don't like you know, I mean I like I call them monster movies more than right, you know
*  I like me too. Yeah, you know, I mean that Charles Lotton and Quasimodo. I mean, it's brilliant
*  Yes, it's a brilliant makeup. Yeah 1939, right?
*  and you know, it's a
*  Perfect makeup on a perfect actor, you know
*  Charles Lotton was great in that movie and you feel for him, you know, you feel for the Frankenstein's monster, you know
*  And those those movies just don't there's there's so few and far between today
*  I gotta see a real Frankenstein type movie. Were you fond of the Robert De Niro version of Frankenstein?
*  You know when I heard they were gonna do that film. I thought I gotta do this, you know, and I
*  Like I said, I don't have an agent. I have a lawyer that makes my deals that I ended up you have to they give you
*  Contracts, you don't understand, you know, right?
*  and
*  He I said, do you know anybody involved with this?
*  Because you know, can you put in a put my name in the hat, you know?
*  And they didn't seem to be interested and when I saw the film I I was kind of glad I didn't do it
*  I wasn't and I also I was disappointed. I thought how cool they got Robert De Niro and not just some big stunt guy, right?
*  No, yeah, because you know Karloff was a good actor
*  I know too and then eventually, you know when it turned into a glint strange
*  Who was bigger and stuff who's still kind of cool Frankenstein, but it wasn't Karloff, you know
*  I thought great that they have an actor, you know, but I was so disappointed when I saw it
*  I didn't think what he did was amazing at all and and
*  The design it was a lot of work and I thought it was well done
*  But it didn't have the impact that the Karloff right? Yeah impacts right expression. Yeah, and and
*  You know and it's something
*  It's very much I when I was a kid I did a makeup thinking well
*  He's pieced together out of a bunch of different people
*  should be lots of scars and some different colors and things, you know, but
*  It's you need a certain
*  silhouette and something that just
*  Catches your eye, you know, and and I didn't think that one did pull up that vent the image of
*  Robert De Niro is Frankenstein and you should pull up Boris Karloff at the same time
*  Boris Karloff one, I mean that was the first and that's iconic
*  Yeah, and again the design if you think about it doesn't make sense, you know, why does he have a flathead and right?
*  Why is he a bolt on his neck? Yeah. Well that makes more sense because that's
*  Yeah
*  That on the left I think that's a test or something it looks different to me. Mm-hmm. Yeah
*  And again, it does kind of make sense when you think of as a man that's pieced together on different parts, right?
*  Why are they piecing his face together? I know and why you know, right?
*  Cuz Boris Boris Karloff wasn't that piece to you know, but it was that the head was very bizarre
*  like yeah with a flathead and you know in in the stuff you read that Jack Pierce said in press at the time
*  was you know, I
*  Frankenstein wasn't a trained surgeon
*  He would take the easiest route to take the brain out the top of his head by cutting the top of set off opening
*  You know like a box. Yeah, I'm putting him, you know new brain and closing it back up like a box
*  But but it still wouldn't be flat
*  Yeah, you would to put the skull back on it. You maybe be an eighth of an inch shorter, you know
*  How about Frankenstein's bride? She was still hot. I know with that nefertiti kind of share the crazy hair
*  Yeah, but she was still hot. Is that the original Frankenstein?
*  That's the Edison Frankenstein, oh again he has kind of a flathead so I think that's my crazy hair. Yeah, getty money
*  She was shaking
*  Yeah, he's kind of goofy looking but
*  Yeah, Carl Carl's face was just so perfect for it, you know, and I didn't know there was that many Frankenstein's
*  Oh, yeah the other one. What is that one?
*  Well, there's Christopher Lee from Chris Frankenstein, right then it's a what's a young Frankenstein Oh young Frank
*  Yeah, and Herman monster on the bottom
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, the monsters are cool, yeah, but it is kind of funny that Herman Munster is just a ripoff of Frankenstein
*  Well, he's supposed to be well, he's supposed to be though and you know, I mean that father's like Dracula
*  Yeah, yeah sure and Eddie's kind of like a little wolf man. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, I remember a TV guide when before this came on the air
*  But they don't know they talked about the new shows that were coming out
*  You know, this is in the 60s and this is when the big monster craze happened
*  And I you know, I was all over it inside there's gonna be a Frankenstein guy on TV, you know
*  And and it was a great time for somebody like me, you know, and it just soaked it all in and
*  What is the impediment like it seems like people love those movies when they come out?
*  Why don't they make more of those movies?
*  You know, well first of all the wolf man that I did wasn't very successful
*  Yeah, I didn't make a lot of money and that was stopped in production at one point
*  It was reshot they reshot a bunch of it. Right? Yeah. Well, we came back for reshoots. And again, this is the same thing
*  Movies called the wolf man, right? They call me up and go we're gonna do some reshoots in three weeks
*  We want you to build suits for two stuntmen
*  Because we're gonna do this quadruped running which wasn't in the film originally
*  And I said in three weeks I said
*  Remember when we did the wolf man, we set up a shop in London that took like
*  Two months to set up, you know
*  All the molds are somewhere in London. I have no idea where they are
*  You've got him in storage somewhere said we had found a crew. We did the whole thing
*  I go there's no way I can do it in three weeks. I said, what are we filming?
*  They said well the fight at the end in the house and all that I said
*  Well, this sets gonna take a while to put back together and oh, you know, we started that three months ago
*  Oh great
*  And I went so you're giving me three weeks to make the wolf man for this reshoot and you knew about it for three months
*  You know and it's like, you know and if they would have called me even a week sooner it was a time when
*  Everybody was out of work. It was kind of a dry time
*  But the you know week before they called me a whole bunch of shows started everybody was busy
*  I couldn't find a crew and it's like, oh my god. How'd you wind up doing it?
*  Working day and night and I got my friends Dave and Lou Elsie again
*  And and I found a couple guys that could kind of do some of the stuff and and we pulled it off
*  You know, but it was I mean I seriously was working day night
*  Got on a plane
*  You know flew to London got off the plane made up an issue. I'm another trailer
*  We had people I hadn't worked with before making up the stunt double
*  When it was like we have to do this because Emily Blunt is gonna be doing Gulliver's Travels
*  She's only available for two days. So we have to film now
*  So I get off the plane make up an issue stunt doubles made up. Everybody's looking good. I
*  walk out to where we're filming and
*  They're filming the stunt double in silhouette
*  And this is again, there's like video village where there's an army producer sitting in in chairs looking at a monitor
*  And I went over to him. I said, okay, you have to explain this to me and they go what Rick and I go
*  Why are we filming this fucking stunt double when Emily Blunt?
*  But he still toro Hugo weaving or sitting in their trailer. We only have Emily Blunt for two nights
*  We're filming in the summer in England. It gets dark at 10 o'clock. It gets light at 4 o'clock in the morning
*  It's gonna be light in two hours. This is one of the two days that we have Emily Blunt
*  Why are we not filming her and they all looked at each other?
*  They go. Yeah that
*  Why are we not filming her? Well, there must there must be a reason, you know
*  Yeah, the movie was cursed
*  What isn't John Landis's son involved in some sort of a remake of American Werewolf
*  He it's been announced that he was gonna do that I don't know if it's ever gonna happen those things happen all the time
*  You know, I they announce it and then it's just yeah and Guillermo de Toro every other week
*  There's some film that he's gonna make that you know, and some of them happen some of them don't you know?
*  But he's a big fan of monster film. He is and he again, I think he's he was a part of the strain wasn't he?
*  Yeah, film. Yeah
*  Yeah, and and I met Guillermo first
*  He was a makeup artist he used to be a makeup artist in Mexico
*  And he was a Dick Smith student and a fan
*  you know Dick Smith fan and Dick introduced me to him and Guillermo came to my studio as a fan boy makeup artist first and
*  I did a Hellboy with him with him
*  And I was in the strain he has me killed by one of the Strigoi in the strain
*  The strain starts off great
*  The book does the books really good for like three quarters of the way through and then it seems like they just kind of tried
*  To finish it. Hmm, you know, it's like very compelling in the beginning
*  It's like an interesting storyline like okay. I see what's going on. I'm not much a reader. I'm kind of dyslexic
*  So I'm a really good reading in do you listen to books on tape? I you know, it doesn't work for me either
*  Oh really? Yeah, I I always say I have too many voices in my head
*  but I when I'm
*  When working, I mean I have a real hard time
*  You know
*  Like if you do a red carpet thing and there's people talking on either side
*  It's short circuits my brain right and they asked me a question and I'm just hearing these other people and I
*  Words don't want to come out of my mouth, you know
*  And it's kind of that way when I'm working and I think part of it
*  Like I said, it was an only child. I mean I learned
*  Working in a room by myself right in print and quiet, you know, right? I like it that way
*  I mean I if I sculpt
*  Or paint I listen to music
*  But if I do stuff on the computer
*  I'll do a lot of designs on the computer and stuff and I do some computer animation stuff for fun
*  I can't have any other any sounds and stuff
*  Yeah, you know if I need to be focused if I you know
*  My wife knows this very well if I'm trying to answer an email and she's like talking to me
*  I just totally screwed up. I mean I your brain just doesn't work that way. I did a
*  book signing the other night
*  And if people are talking when I'm signing my name, I wrote I wrote the press
*  I asked the person how to spell her name and then they were saying something else and I screwed up their book
*  Oh, I've written my name wrong
*  in the book there's a
*  Picture some drawings I did as a kid and one I did in pen and ink of Dracula
*  And I wanted to be because it was pen and ink and I couldn't erase it
*  I you know got out famous monsters to make sure I spelled Dracula right and
*  Very carefully was looking at the letters and writing in a pen and ink. It says drac lila
*  And I did a painting for my wife
*  This kind of romantic old painting
*  And
*  You know it was for Valentine's Day and I wanted I didn't know how to spell Valentine so I looked it up
*  And I very carefully painted
*  Valentine time
*  so
*  again, thank God that
*  My career choice worked out because I couldn't work in an office and I'm sure I'd be a homeless guy now
*  I mean my brain just doesn't work like a normal person
*  Well, but it with the way it does work is wonderful
*  Your brain can focus on the things that you really love and you figure out how to
*  How to get it to focus correctly just shut the music off just be alone. Yeah, I know I
*  It surprised me that I can do that, you know
*  And but and and I really get in the zone and I really focus on what I'm doing and to me
*  I mean the funny thing is I mean my I
*  Think I started saying this before I was talking about not wanting to be a businessman and stuff and people are always surprised that
*  I'm hands-on still, you know
*  a lot of other people who have for example Stan Winston who was
*  Great hadn't did some great stuff and was great for the makeup industry and and and helped it
*  advance the state of the art was a businessman more than a
*  Hands-on guy he hired people to do the work and he he had a good eye and he would contribute stuff
*  But he rarely sculpted the stuff. I tried to sculpt the stuff. I designed stuff, you know
*  And and I'm always surprised when people go I paint and sculpt and do all these things, you know, and and
*  When people see one of my paintings they go you can paint, you know, and it's like there's shock that I can paint and go
*  You can sculpt, you know, I have a there's a bronze gorilla at the LA Zoo
*  That's a sculpture that I did
*  And people go you you can sculpt. Oh, yeah, it's part of what I do
*  Yeah, you know, so but yeah
*  I don't know where I was going with that
*  But yeah, I do you think that there's ever a project that could come up that could tempt you into coming out of retirement
*  if somebody listens to you on this podcast and realizes that a lot of people fuck with you while you worked and said Rick
*  We could do something amazing. Just one more, you know when I first retired I would have said yes
*  I mean I I was leaving it open that I said well, I'll maybe do designs or consult, you know
*  I'm having way too much fun doing my own thing
*  You know, I mean I I still probably have the remains of my Halloween makeup, you know
*  Halloween is a big thing in my family. I'm so sorry. They didn't send you a copy of the book. It's good
*  I'll get it. Don't worry. Well, I get it. I'll put it on the Instagram
*  It's not so much about that. I just think if you're a fan, I think you're like no
*  I am a fan. I'm blown away by the response that I'm getting. That's awesome from people
*  I mean, they're loving it. It's not a cheap book. It's like 250 bucks, you know, but it's weighs 17 pounds
*  It's two volumes and with 2,000 pictures in it from birth
*  Basically to my last film and beyond, you know in in my retirement, but I don't know where I was going with that
*  What'd you ask me? Well, we were talking about possibly coming out. Oh, yeah, you were saying how much fun you're having right now
*  No, I I I seriously doubt that anything would get me back. Well, that's great to hear what cuz it's not great
*  You know, I'd love it if you did another movie, but it's great to hear that you're having such a good time
*  well, you know one of the things I
*  when I watched Breaking Bad
*  And
*  Bryan Cranston, you know such a great actor
*  But I said, you know, he would make a great Lon Chaney if they ever did a remake of man of a thousand faces
*  Which was the story of Lon Chaney?
*  he would be a perfect person, you know besides being a great actor and
*  my wife Sylvia and I went to a comic-con and went to a
*  panel that they had on Breaking Bad and and we went back and I met Brian and and and Vince and and I said that
*  to him, you know, you know
*  And I don't know maybe if that happened, you know
*  I don't think anybody would go see that film now or how many people you know Lon Chaney is now, you know
*  but he
*  To be able to recreate some of those makeups on an actor like that, you know
*  and if it was the right people but again, I I
*  realized
*  you know, I mean
*  Death became a more real thing to me when my parents died
*  And I have friends that were younger than me that are dead now one of my favorite crew one of my best guys and we
*  Just recently passed
*  54 or something
*  And I know there's an end in sight and I know, you know, I've got arthritis my I've got cataracts. I
*  There's a limited time that I have left to do the things I want to do and I want to do what I want to do
*  You know what I mean? And I don't want the frustration and the stress and beautiful. Yeah beautiful
*  You already did it. Yeah
*  Most amazing movies ever. I mean, you know if I died today, which I hope I don't I mean
*  I would be happy with what I've accomplished and that was another thing with the book
*  I mean when you see it laid out there and in 800 pages, you know
*  Saying well, I've made a lot of shit my time, you know, yeah, I've made a lot of stuff and and I'm proud of what I made
*  you know, I mean you do the best you can in the circumstances and I fight one of the things that I
*  Realized when I read the book to
*  Which Cameron publishing who did the book and Jonathan Rinsler who wrote it who did?
*  He interviewed me a lot and he also went back to old articles and old things at the time and did a really nice job of
*  Weaving the story together. But when I read it, I thought God, you know, what a pain in the ass
*  I am but I fight for what I think is right for example the Grinch
*  How the Grinch told Christmas?
*  They wanted me to paint Jim Carrey green and that was it, you know, and it was like well
*  I mean, I think they wanted some hair too, you know, but right but come on, you know
*  It's not called how the green Jim Carrey sold Christmas right Grinch Christmas. Yeah Grinch, you know
*  So I did like I do many times on myself like I did in the wolf man
*  I make myself up and I film some stuff and I show them
*  So I made myself up what I thought the Grinch would look like I filmed some stuff. I cut it together
*  I showed it to him good. You got this. This is cooler than a green Jim Carrey
*  I'm sorry, you know and they're going well, it doesn't look like Jim Carrey and go no because it's on me and I go
*  But again, it's not the green Jim Carrey, you know, right and it seems to me
*  It should be this character not just you know, yeah, I fought and fought and fought and I ended up doing a thing
*  Where I decided to use the internet
*  to help me get my point across so there was a
*  A
*  Internet movie site at the time that was popular and and I knew the guy who ran it was always a fan and I said
*  can you
*  Say that you saw this test that I did and that the guys at Universal are making a big mistake
*  You know and just let the fans
*  Chime in so there was like thousands of responses. What the hell's wrong with these idiots that are running the movie studios?
*  It shouldn't be I don't want to see a green Jim Carrey
*  So like two weeks before we started filming they they changed because of this and I had sent you know
*  I only sent the copy of my test to Brian Grazer and Ron Howard and Ron's going
*  How did this guy get hold of this copy of the tape? I don't know
*  I only sent it to you and and Brian, you know, and I mean it'll let him know what I did at the time
*  Now I don't care cuz it came it's I think the movie is better for it, you know
*  And in fact even at an Oscar party
*  one of the executives at the studio came up to me and said, you know, thank you for
*  For doing the Grinch and for arguing with us because you were the decision was right. It was definitely right
*  You turned him into the Grinch and really was the Grinch, but I thought I was gonna get hit by a meteor or something
*  This is not right
*  An executive never tells you that stuff
*  I
*  But I again, I mean I I fight because it's my work and if my name's on it
*  I want it to be of a certain quality, you know, and and it's not easy to get it done that way, you know, and and
*  It's part of the battle, you know
*  But it's also part of the frustration, you know, so now I only have to fight with myself, you know beautiful listen man
*  Thank you very much for coming here. It's been an honor and really I was really looking forward to this
*  Real treat for me to get to sit down and talk to you. Oh, thank you so much
*  I'm glad we do I figure anybody that has an American Warhol in their lobby can't be bad guy
*  Thank you, Rick. Thank you. My pleasure. Bye everybody
