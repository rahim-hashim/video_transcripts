# Joe Rogan Experience #2172 - Sebastian Junger
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmRrJUHvk-M)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  As I was saying, you're one of the last of the Malikans rocking that flip phone.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  I'm proud of it.
*  Do you text people?
*  Yeah, yeah, I text.
*  Do you do the do, do, do, do, do, or it takes a bunch of times?
*  Well, it's something called T9.
*  It's predictive texting.
*  So, you know, it gives you a bunch of alternatives.
*  You just have to do it all on a keypad with your thumb rather than with an iPhone with
*  you have the full alphabet.
*  But I bet that battery lasts like a week.
*  I don't even travel with a charger, man.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I mean, unless I'm gone for a week.
*  But if I'm just gone for a couple of days and I don't have any long conversations planned,
*  I don't even bother.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  All emailed, everything's handled at home.
*  Plus.
*  All on the laptop, right?
*  Yeah, plus chicks dig it, man.
*  It's crazy.
*  They do?
*  No.
*  What kind of chicks are you hanging around with?
*  Savages.
*  No, at one point I was at CNN waiting for to go on and these two young women kept looking
*  at me.
*  You know, this is like 10 years ago.
*  So I plausibly could say to myself, well, maybe I still got it, right?
*  Like who knew?
*  Right?
*  And then one of them noticed that I had noticed them looking at me and she goes, oh, excuse
*  me, sir, we were just, we can't believe that you have a flip phone.
*  So I was like, well, that's the end of an era.
*  Ten years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Ten years ago there was a few people out there that were hanging out.
*  My friend Ari still had a flip phone 10 years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  The only people I know now are you and David Tell.
*  So you're in good company.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  It's cool.
*  I'm telling you, it's cool.
*  It's coming back.
*  It's the next big thing.
*  Well, I know a lot of people, you know, they switch to what's called, I think it's called
*  a simple phone.
*  Is that what it's called, Jamie?
*  What is that thing called?
*  What's that?
*  No, the little tiny, the one that's, it just gives you nothing but like text message.
*  I think you can get music on it too.
*  I think it's called a simple phone.
*  It's like a, like you ever, do you read on a tablet, you know, like one of those Kindles?
*  I don't.
*  Well, the great thing about those is they have this white paper looking interface.
*  So it doesn't look like a screen.
*  It looks like paper.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what this little phone looks like.
*  And it's the same sort of, that's what it is.
*  Light phone.
*  Yeah.
*  That thing.
*  So it has basically the same thing as your phone, except you could text like a normal
*  human and it'll play music and has notes.
*  It gives you directions.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's not bad.
*  I mean, what I don't want is to get sucked into the algorithms of social media and all
*  that garbage.
*  Like you don't want to get into the algorithms on men.
*  You don't want, I have seen more people fall off buildings, get hit by cars, get shot,
*  get stabbed.
*  And just not participate in their life.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Even if nothing bad happens, you're still, I mean, listen, man, I have two, I have young
*  children.
*  I have a seven year old girl and a four year old girl.
*  I'm more at the playground and I swear there are kids who fall and I, and I gotta go, kids,
*  I don't know.
*  I gotta go over and like dust them off and comfort them because the mom or dad doesn't
*  even know cause they're on their phone.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  That's not parenting.
*  I mean, like what do you do?
*  What do you have to do for it?
*  Especially playgrounds, man.
*  Playgrounds are still a little sketchy.
*  You know, my daughter, when she was six, she broke her arm at school.
*  On a playground.
*  Really?
*  Actually, she was a little older than six.
*  She might've been eight.
*  But yeah, it's, playgrounds are fucking scary, man.
*  You know, you're, you're swinging around and you're playing and kids fall the wrong way.
*  And we're on the Lower East Side in New York City.
*  So it's sketchy in some other ways too.
*  Like you gotta, you gotta be awake, right?
*  Yeah.
*  You gotta be alert and just like, and not only that, but you had kids, like, what do
*  you do?
*  Like, just enjoy this while you can.
*  Right.
*  This is a TikTok video more interesting than your, the human that you made.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  You guys made humans.
*  They're the right, I mean, that still freaks me out to this day, even when they're mad
*  at me.
*  You know, I can't believe you made you.
*  I made you and now you're mad at me.
*  Like, how does that work?
*  Like, yeah.
*  I have all girls, so they're mad at you for stuff that doesn't even make sense.
*  Like you're like, okay.
*  How old are they?
*  The youngest right now is 14.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So I got seven and four.
*  So right.
*  So that thing's coming.
*  Okay.
*  Got it.
*  Yeah.
*  I got a 14 and 16 and then a grown one, a 27 year old.
*  Because I, you know, I've had girlfriends that didn't, were mad at me for things that
*  I didn't think made sense.
*  And I was like, okay, well that's all right.
*  That's because you're crazy and you know, whatever.
*  But actually like that might be in my future.
*  Yeah, it's, they're just different.
*  It's just women and girls are just different.
*  And me, you know, I think the universe did me a solid by giving me only daughters.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  Because you, you have a different perspective.
*  Like if I had a son, I'd be like, I got to keep this fucking savage out of jail.
*  I got to, because I'm passing my genes.
*  That kid's got to go to the gym.
*  I mean, I got to get you into a jujitsu gym early.
*  Like you got to start doing challenging things early.
*  And then also you have to deal with the fact that you have a successful father and that
*  puts a lot of pressure on a kid because they, you know, a lot of kids, they try to measure
*  up to their parents or compete with their fathers and some sort of a strange way.
*  So you have to mitigate that in advance and tell them that you're there for them.
*  You're on their side.
*  You know, it's like, there's a lot with kids, but with girls, they're so different, man.
*  I didn't, I just, I don't think I understood until I raised children.
*  I just didn't understand how different they are.
*  Yeah.
*  Yep.
*  I agree.
*  And I'm, I have two girls.
*  I'm thrilled.
*  I mean, it's the best thing that ever happened to me in my life that I'm meeting my wife.
*  Like just incredible.
*  And partly because they're girls and not boys.
*  I have nothing to learn from boys.
*  I already know what that's about.
*  I am one, right?
*  But girls is just like, it's amazing.
*  It just, and it wakes up some part of you that was dormant and you didn't know was there.
*  And it's just like, it's an amazing feeling.
*  Dave Chappelle said to me once that not only did it change the amount of love I have, but
*  it changed my capacity for love.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a great way to put it.
*  It's just a completely different experience.
*  And I have friends that are just avowed bachelors.
*  I'm never getting married.
*  I'm never having kids.
*  Fuck that.
*  And I'm like, I get it.
*  I know if you've had a bunch of bad relationships, you have a bunch of people that are annoying
*  and they're constant drama and dilemmas and all these different things.
*  But man, you're missing out on a different, different phase of life, a different experience
*  of life.
*  That's just, it's so humbling.
*  But you got to meet the right person, right?
*  I mean, if you're not with the right person, I imagine being on top of that, that's hard
*  enough just on its own.
*  On top of that, parenting with the wrong person must be a freaking nightmare.
*  Yeah.
*  You've got to fucking go on a dinner with the wrong person is a nightmare.
*  A nightmare.
*  Just dealing with nonsense.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially if you're not the type of person that handles nonsense so well.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just ugh.
*  Well, what I do, for a variety of family reasons, I flatline.
*  If someone's coming at me with something that doesn't make sense and they're really upset,
*  I just sort of emotionally flatline.
*  I get super rational and just zero Kelvin, like nothing.
*  Which is kind of a good place to be because it's not escalatory.
*  But I've come to find out that's also exceedingly provocative to do to someone who's upset.
*  Oh, so they try to get a response out of you.
*  Yeah.
*  They think that your non-response means you don't care.
*  Ooh, that's a problem.
*  And then you're just so screwed.
*  That's also a problem with emotional manipulation.
*  You realize that this escalation of emotions is really just to incite a reaction.
*  It's not the real feelings.
*  That's right.
*  Which is why it's so exaggerated.
*  I think I'm doing the relationship a favor by, yeah, it was like somebody's got to stay
*  sane in this room, right?
*  Or it's going to be the cops again.
*  Whatever.
*  So I'm like, all right, I'm going to flatline.
*  The only way to do this, because you're making me really angry right now, is to flatline
*  and feel nothing.
*  You're not going to do us a favor by doing that.
*  I'll be super rational and calm and blah, blah, blah.
*  But I didn't realize that's completely inflammatory also in a different way.
*  So there really isn't a good choice until that person figures out how to emotionally
*  regulate.
*  Yeah.
*  The good choice is get the fuck out of Dodge.
*  That's a good choice.
*  Stay rational and calm as you can until you can abandon that relationship.
*  Unless that person has just a complete understanding of what went wrong and apologizes and realizes
*  like, oh, I'm being fucking crazy.
*  I knew a guy who was, I won't name him, his older brother.
*  They're both sort of pretty well known writers and his older brother was in a bad relationship
*  of that sort.
*  And they were walking through, I think it was Paris.
*  They were visiting Paris and all their stuff was at the hotel.
*  This is before cell phones.
*  This is in the early 90s, late 80s, something like that.
*  And they're walking through Paris and they stopped to look, she stopped to look at some
*  clothing in a shopfront, through the window.
*  And it took him some steps to realize that she had stopped and he had kept going.
*  And he looked at her and he looked down the street.
*  He was like, this is my chance.
*  And he just started sprinting.
*  Oh my God.
*  And he sprinted all the way to the hotel, paid the bill, left 500 bucks on the bed,
*  threw his stuff in a suitcase, out of there, straight to the airport.
*  And that was the last time they ever saw each other.
*  Wow.
*  It was that bad?
*  It was that bad.
*  The pressure that he must have been feeling that allowed him to make that decision.
*  Like he must have just been in hell.
*  I don't think he was just a dick.
*  He might have also been a dick, but I think one of the things that was going on, because
*  I've been in relationships that were pretty tough, is that you can't even have the breakup
*  conversation because it goes full nuclear.
*  Right?
*  So you don't know what to do.
*  Right.
*  You gotta flee.
*  I support him.
*  I mean, if he's a rational guy, and he's never done that before, that seems like, if that's
*  his move, that maybe it's you.
*  Right.
*  And then he met the right gal and they had a family and he's a great dad, blah, blah,
*  blah.
*  He was just a congenital asshole.
*  Right.
*  But that was his move.
*  In a split second.
*  Wow.
*  Split second.
*  I'm out of here.
*  That's crazy.
*  No cell phones, of course.
*  So now you'd be getting speed dialed over and over and over again.
*  Wow.
*  So he never saw her again?
*  No.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's wild.
*  Boy, that must have been a mess.
*  I love that moment where he looked back like, oh, she's in front of the store.
*  And he just ran.
*  I have a 20 yard head start.
*  That is so crazy.
*  I don't support it, but I get it.
*  I've never been that bad in that bad of a situation, but I've known people that have.
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes you just got to do what you have to do to stay alive.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like literally.
*  Because bad relationships and bad friendships and bad jobs and bad a lot of things, can
*  They rob you of your peace.
*  They create anxiety, which creates like physical problems.
*  Your body's under stress.
*  Your cortisol levels get jacked up.
*  That fucks with your sleep, which fucks with your health.
*  Like you're literally robbing your life.
*  I have a couple of buddies who I love who are bipolar and I lost one of them.
*  He killed himself and it's tragic, but the other guy is okay.
*  And they're bipolar.
*  And having a relationship with someone who's bipolar is almost impossible.
*  No matter how much you love them, it really presents a complicated challenge.
*  And if you're having a romantic relationship with someone who's bipolar, which I've done,
*  it's like a thousand times harder from a buddy.
*  Right.
*  And that was, I've had a couple of those and it is really in some ways the most painful
*  experiences of my life.
*  So that was the sort of sprinting from the shop front window.
*  I didn't do quite that, but close.
*  Because if someone's bipolar, it's also volatile.
*  That's sometimes your only choice.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, the bipolar thing is wild because if your mind works well, you think, well, tell
*  that person to get it together.
*  Makes no sense.
*  Right.
*  You're not making sense on it.
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  But you don't understand.
*  Their brains, it's like the chemicals in their brain are all fucked up.
*  Everything's all fucked up.
*  They can't.
*  It's almost impossible to get it together.
*  It's like you being on fire and someone saying, stay calm.
*  Like how the fuck are you going to stay calm while you're on fire?
*  Exactly right.
*  With lithium.
*  Is that it?
*  Is that the move?
*  That's it.
*  Is there anything else that works for those folks?
*  It saved two people that I know of that I really loved, really close to.
*  One guy and a woman that I dated who I later found out she stabilized on lithium.
*  What is the downside of taking the lithium?
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  You're emotionally flat.
*  You put on weight.
*  All kinds of stuff.
*  All kinds of stuff that's better than suicide.
*  That's true.
*  It's not good.
*  And bipolar, it destroys relationships.
*  It's a very, very tough deal.
*  And often the result of trauma.
*  In both cases of these people that I care about, they traumatize their children.
*  It often produces that terrible behavior that then just fulfills itself your whole life.
*  It's absolutely tragic.
*  The crazy thing is they don't even know.
*  Some people, it's not even trauma.
*  They just get it.
*  They just have it.
*  There's some neurochemical stuff.
*  But trauma is a known correlate to bipolar as an adult.
*  The crazy thing about mental illness is that it's just no one can really tell what's going
*  on in your head.
*  And it's up to you to talk to your psychiatrist or whatever and try to explain it.
*  And they have to try to make a map of the territory.
*  But no one knows how you think about things other than you.
*  And are you an honest reporter on your own experience?
*  So if you're telling your shrink about the fight you had with your wife the other night,
*  are you really being an honest, you know, and what bipolar people do, they are so, I
*  think on some level, so fearful and well defended, psychologically defended, that they have a
*  very hard time saying, yeah, my wife's mad at me.
*  But on the other hand, I was kind of a dick.
*  And, you know, they can't do that.
*  It's all sort of victim centered.
*  And then the shrink doesn't, hopefully they see through this stuff, but they don't necessarily
*  know that that's not true.
*  Well, there's just so many medications that get prescribed to people based on the person
*  reporting a feeling that you can't see in a test.
*  You know, like if someone says, like, if you have some sort of a disease, they say, oh,
*  we found that you're sick with syphilis, whatever it is, and we're going to give you this medicine,
*  and we've got this figured out.
*  We tested you.
*  We know what it is.
*  With your mind, you know, like if someone says they're depressed, like, okay, what does
*  that mean?
*  What does that mean?
*  There's no measurement.
*  There's nothing, you know, like so they have to say, okay, let's try a little of this or
*  try a little of that and try to figure out what it is.
*  There are some things that are legit bad, really, really tough things to have, like
*  borderline, and my buddy, I mean, he was my closest friend.
*  He was my brother, right?
*  And he's the best man at my first wedding, and we were in Bosnia together during the
*  civil war, and just brothers, right?
*  And amazing, brilliant, funny, funny man.
*  He was a lifelong depressive, and part of his brilliance was rooted in, he says, in
*  his depression, like it gave him a certain kind of mind, and he was, but he was finally
*  diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and one of the problems with schizoaffective is
*  that they reject the diagnosis, right?
*  They're saying, no, no, no, everyone has it wrong.
*  I'm fine, and I have no problem, and it's you guys that don't understand what I'm
*  up against, right?
*  And so it's very hard to treat because they, like borderlines, they reject the idea,
*  narcissism disorder is another one.
*  They reject the idea there's anything wrong with them.
*  So it's really, really hard to treat.
*  It's crazy when someone's weakness is actually like their strength in their career, you know?
*  Which is a thing with some creative types, like there's this guy, Richard Jennings, like
*  one of my all-time favorite comedians, and he killed himself.
*  And everyone who didn't know him was baffled.
*  They were like, that guy's at the top of his game.
*  That guy's everything we all want to be.
*  He was so good that I went to this club in New York, in upstate New York, or in Long
*  Island, rather, East Side Comedy Club, and this dude, Peter, who is the emcee, was depressed
*  because he worked with Richard Jennings all weekend.
*  And he was like, he did a new hour every night.
*  He did a new hour, two hours Friday, two different hours, two different hours Saturday.
*  For most of us, we have one hour.
*  You're right.
*  Like while we're on the road, we have one hour.
*  We tone that thing down.
*  We tighten it up.
*  We fucking, we edit it.
*  We get it to it's like a rock in one hour.
*  This motherfucker destroyed with four different hours on a weekend.
*  And Peter was like, I should quit comedy.
*  Like, this is a real, that's a real comedian.
*  I'm a fucking poser.
*  This fuck, and that guy killed himself.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, my John, my buddy, like he, I mean, he, he wasn't a professional comedian, but
*  he could have been right.
*  I mean, he had that unbelievable brilliance and just devastating humor and just crazy.
*  I mean, his, he could just, he could just sort of sit there and just riff.
*  Right.
*  I mean, he just like, and he would go for an hour and everyone would be like pissing
*  themselves on the floor and he just on and on.
*  He went right.
*  Just this brilliant riff that had never been heard before would never be heard again.
*  And it just flowed through him.
*  And, and, but he was a, you know, life, I mean, as a teenager, he, he said, you know,
*  I'm, he said to his mom, he said, I know eventually I'm going to kill myself.
*  He knew that as a teenager.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  And he held it off a long time.
*  He had a family, two, two little girls.
*  And he was like, he killed himself while his girls were young.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, of course it's hard not to say, John, what the fuck?
*  Right.
*  Like you kidding.
*  And, but then I realized, no, no, no, that just shows how much pain he was in.
*  Yeah.
*  They just can't take it.
*  They can't take it.
*  And they're worried what they're going to do with that pain.
*  Are they a threat to their family?
*  Right.
*  Are they, can they trust themselves?
*  Right.
*  There, you know, I think they start to worry about that.
*  There's an amazing story.
*  Not that I know that this was where John was at, but it could have been.
*  There's an amazing story from the Iliad and the Odyssey of Ajax, Ajax, who threw
*  himself on his sword, right.
*  And the, the, the, the, the, the, the conventional understanding is that he was
*  dishonored by Agamemnon in some way that I can't remember.
*  And he couldn't, after the trauma of combat and the siege of Troy, and he lost
*  his best friend, et cetera, et cetera, he couldn't stand the dishonor.
*  He had PTSD, right.
*  And sort of contemporary terms, and he threw himself on his sword.
*  And I sort of looked into the story a little bit because it didn't quite, I was
*  like, wow, that's a lot of honor.
*  Right.
*  I mean, that's like, he had a family, he had children.
*  That's why would you.
*  So what it turned out was that he had, he was walking on a hillside and he, in his
*  mind, he thought he was attacked by the enemy and he drew his sword and he killed
*  them all, and then he realized he had killed a herd of sheep.
*  Whoa.
*  In his trauma, he had mistaken sheep for the enemy.
*  And I, I have no proof of this.
*  I've never heard, you know, whatever, like I'm, I'll stand down if I'm wrong, but
*  it occurred to me that what he thought at that moment was if I can kill a herd of
*  sheep, because I think they're Trojans, my family's not safe.
*  No one's safe.
*  No one's safe.
*  Right.
*  And I'm a warrior.
*  I'm a protector.
*  My job is to defend and protect.
*  And if I think a herd of sheep are enemy warriors, like I am not safe for my loved
*  ones to be around.
*  And he said to his half brother, please take care of my family.
*  And then he went down to the beach.
*  He buried the, the, the, the, um, the handle of his sword in the sand at an angle.
*  And then he ran and he threw himself on the sword and killed himself.
*  Oh, that's a rough way to go.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you're worried, you're going to kill the things that are most precious to
*  you.
*  How can you not?
*  Also, when you're talking about childhood trauma, imagine childhood trauma in a
*  time where people fought with swords.
*  Oh my God.
*  What did you see?
*  Absolutely.
*  You know, what did you say when you were a baby?
*  Yeah.
*  What did you see your whole life?
*  People getting beheaded and gutted and, you know, and then you're off at war.
*  Just, yeah.
*  And when you come back from war, you know, you're not coming back from like
*  landing rounds at 500 meters against the enemy position, right?
*  I mean, you're coming back with, you know, people's blood on you.
*  I mean, covered in other men's blood, right.
*  And entrails and whatever else.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the Iliad is it.
*  It's like a medical textbook.
*  It's like, then he sliced his abdomen open and his entrails fell out and he
*  staggered away holding his entrails and then this, and then that, I mean, it's
*  completely bloody, right?
*  Visceral in the literal sense of viscera, right?
*  Like completely bloody.
*  If that's what combat was like, and I'm sure for the native Americans and, you
*  know, here as well, like it must have been unbelievably traumatizing to the guys who
*  did it.
*  Unbelievably.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, one on one combat with swords must be so insane.
*  Yeah.
*  And arrows flying and cannonballs.
*  Yeah.
*  Now they were hunting cultures, like in, for example, in North America, they were
*  hunting cultures and they were used to, you know, gutting animals and the guts
*  spilling out and, you know, beheading, you know, whatever.
*  Like, I mean, they were used to that, you know, with animals, with hunting, they were
*  used to blood and guts, literally blood and guts.
*  So maybe the transition to warfare is less of a distance to cross than it is for a
*  kid who grew up in a suburb of Boston and then suddenly is in Afghanistan and, you
*  know, it gets intimate and bloody.
*  You can, you know, the psychic distance that that person has to travel is quite
*  far. It may be not quite doable.
*  That's a way to put it.
*  That's a good way to put it.
*  The psychic distance that one has to travel.
*  Right.
*  But just, I think you get accustomed to what's normal.
*  Right.
*  But I think every human being that existed back then was probably in this
*  heightened state of urgency and fear because they had experienced sword fights.
*  Right.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  And also no distractions.
*  You're staring up at the stars every night.
*  You're waking up in the morning to sword fight again.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  That's right.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  That's right.
*  No Instagram.
*  Nothing.
*  Nothing.
*  Stories are being told by the fire.
*  Everyone's on a flip phone.
*  You got a flip phone back then.
*  Man, you've run everything.
*  Like, look, I want to call the general.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Right now.
*  From the trench?
*  Like what?
*  Yeah.
*  From the trench?
*  Yeah.
*  What do kids do?
*  I mean, these fucking kids are filming things now, which is really crazy.
*  The footage that you get out of Ukraine right now is so nuts.
*  Oh my God.
*  Insane.
*  So nuts because it's high resolution cell phone camera and GoPro video footage.
*  It's absolutely crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, as a person who's been there, you know, like when you did Restrepo and,
*  you know, you've been to wars, what is it like for you to see these new ones emerge?
*  And I mean, I've always hoped that there's going to become a time in our culture, in
*  my life where we're not going to be involved in any of this shit anymore.
*  We the human race or the US?
*  We the human race, and particularly the US.
*  Well, I mean, here's the thing.
*  Like I have, you know, I have some sort of like peace oriented friends, pacifist friends.
*  I mean, there's a sort of two different flavors, right?
*  There's a sort of a conservative isolationism and a liberal pacifism.
*  And they wind up ironically in sort of the same place is like war is bad.
*  We don't want any part of it.
*  You know, like the convergence is sort of interesting politically.
*  But so that the sort of left wing people that I know are sort of Vietnam era pacifists.
*  Right.
*  And so in my mind, I'm like, listen, you know, if war is bad, avoiding it isn't the
*  only, you know, there is a moral case to be made for, say, in Bosnia, which was stopped
*  by a very brief NATO intervention.
*  And, you know, you could make a moral case for, you know, drop a few bombs.
*  The war stops and then human life is preserved.
*  Yeah, you can make you can make that case.
*  But but, you know, basically the the for I think for, say, for Ukraine, peacefulness
*  works and it's a wonderful thing to aspire to serve as long as no one invades you.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And if you if you knew that no one would invade you and you're warlike anyway, you're
*  an asshole. Right.
*  Right.
*  But what you have to do, any society from a, you know, a group of like Comanche warriors
*  in the hill country around Austin in 1840 or Ukraine or the US or Israel or any any
*  nation. Right.
*  You have to figure out how to be a peace loving society that can also defend itself.
*  And that's really and then if you're going to defend yourself, what is your obligation
*  to defend your your your allies or your friends or even just on a strategic level?
*  Countries where if they fall, then eventually the dominoes wind up with you.
*  And I don't know the answers to that.
*  But that to me is like the strategic and moral question is like, where is that?
*  Where is that line where you have to defend something?
*  Because eventually you're going to be end up defending yourselves.
*  Yeah, it's just when does the human race ever get out of the cycle?
*  Just individuals as human beings are capable of coexisting in harmony.
*  But when we get into groups, there's always something it's like it's unavoidable.
*  And if any if you I mean, we've talked about this a bunch of times, but if you ever ask
*  people in your lifetime, do you think there'll be no war?
*  No one says yes.
*  Well, there's always the possibility of a bad actor that's like, you know what?
*  I want those oil fields.
*  I want those diamond mines.
*  I want whatever.
*  Like there's all and you know, we've been that that guy too sometimes.
*  Right.
*  And you know, you're you're a strong jacked up guy who knows how to fight.
*  And if the world contained only peaceful men, you wouldn't need to be.
*  You might want to be, but you wouldn't need to be.
*  Right.
*  But you walking down the street, you know, in your mind, like I come to I can defend
*  my family and myself with my hands.
*  Like, and I need to know that I can.
*  I'm just reading into your mind.
*  Like, I don't obviously I don't know how you think, but I'm guessing that somewhere
*  in your mind, you're like, I can take care of business if my family's threatened.
*  And and there's there's a security in that.
*  And if you just knew for a fact that there were no predatory people out there, not one
*  you wouldn't need to be.
*  Right.
*  But that's not the we're social primates and that's not the world that we evolved
*  in and that's not it's never going to happen.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Unless something changes.
*  Something really big.
*  Right.
*  And it's not going to change overnight.
*  No.
*  Right.
*  I mean, we have the DNA we have.
*  We have the cultural wiring that we have.
*  You know, it's it's so, you know, all the democracies, which are, you know, tend
*  towards sort of fairness and and peacefulness because it's frankly good for business.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  War is not particularly good for the stock market.
*  Unless you are Raytheon.
*  Right.
*  For some business.
*  Some businesses, absolutely.
*  But for the array of economic enterprise in the world, like war, you know, war doesn't
*  war doesn't do the economy is much good overall.
*  And the so the the the question is, like, how do you so democracies are invested in
*  stability in market stability.
*  They're invested in it because they disproportionately benefit from it.
*  Right.
*  Iraq under Hussein was not disproportionately benefiting from market stability because it
*  was an oppressive dictatorship.
*  Right.
*  And the economy sucked and there was a ton of corruption.
*  Right.
*  But democracies are quite they really do benefit from stability.
*  But all those democracies are defended by really robust militaries.
*  Right.
*  And if and if they weren't right, they would get overrun like in half a generation.
*  Right.
*  Well, that's what scares the shit out of me about today, because I think with with AI
*  and with weapons technology advancing in the same exponential rate as cell phone
*  technology and computer technology is we're getting to this really weird place where
*  it's not just mutually assured destruction because of nuclear weapons.
*  It's like it's whoever presses the button first wins.
*  Right.
*  And so you have this like if you can completely disable a nation's army almost
*  instantaneously.
*  Right.
*  And then take over their cities or bomb their cities like instantaneously.
*  It's just we're relying on good nature.
*  Right.
*  The the understanding that this is a horrible thing to do to humanity to pull that
*  trigger first.
*  Right.
*  Well, there's also this sort of what do you what happens when the dog catches the
*  tire. Right.
*  So if Russia had I mean what the Ukrainians I mean all the politics and whatever aside
*  just on this on a military level, what the what the Ukrainians were able to do, you
*  know, quite outmatched by the by the Russians, what the Afghan with the with the
*  Taliban were able to do with the U.S., the Mujahideen against the Russians, all of
*  this like with the what the Ukrainians were able to do against the Russians is quite
*  extraordinary. The Russians really should have taken Ukraine in a few weeks.
*  Right. And had they that would have been what that was what everyone predicted.
*  I didn't think that was going to happen.
*  That was what everyone predicted didn't happen.
*  And the motivation to defend your home is always far greater than than the motivation
*  to invade someone else's home.
*  Just for the 19 year old male like that, the motivation is, as you know, I'm sure
*  from MMA is like super important in outcome.
*  Right. And so but had the Russians done it, had they taken had they just blitzkrieg
*  all the way through Ukraine, seized it, then they would have what they would have
*  had is the huge, huge and costly problem of
*  maintaining order in in a nation of 40 million people, 40 million resentful
*  people who did not want to be governed by outsiders.
*  Like, don't try this at home.
*  Right. I mean, this is and so I think, yeah, so you can take out say you had a magic,
*  you know, electromagnetic pulse that took out everything in the I mean, I'm just
*  bullshitting here, took out everything that the US military relies on to communicate
*  and to function. You just zapped it out of existence and invade it.
*  Right. The Russians took the east of the Mississippi, the Chinese took west of the
*  Mississippi or whatever, whatever it might be.
*  Then you got to run this place.
*  And that's when you really have a tactical problem.
*  Township by township, mountain by mountain.
*  And then it's and then your electromagnetic pulse actually doesn't serve you that well.
*  And, you know, the Afghans, I mean, the Taliban didn't defeat us.
*  They just outlasted us.
*  And so we got tired of being there and didn't want to pay the bill.
*  Yeah. So you're what I when I got reached out to about you was that you had gotten
*  through a near death experience and I really didn't want to read into it at all.
*  I just wanted to ask you about it.
*  Sure. So something happened.
*  You had an aneurysm that burst inside internally.
*  He does. Yeah.
*  So I mean, the short, you know, the medical description is I had an undiagnosed aneurysm,
*  which is a ballooning of an artery at a weak spot.
*  Like so I mean, arteries can dilate to get more blood flow.
*  But an aneurysm is like one specific spot that for one reason or another is weak and it
*  starts to sort of give way and it'll bubble outwards.
*  And as that bubble grows bigger and this takes decades, it's a very slow process.
*  Right. I have basically I have a ligament in the wrong place.
*  And that set in motion a sort of vascular problem that resulted in an aneurysm.
*  And they don't they don't hurt.
*  There's no way to diagnose them.
*  I mean, unless you scan someone's abdomen, I've always been super healthy.
*  And so throughout my life, I just never had any reason for an abdominal scan.
*  Right. I'm fit, fit, healthy male.
*  Right. Fit, healthy person.
*  And so I just never needed that that look inside me.
*  So no one saw the aneurysm growing.
*  Right. And so at it's at some point, the artery wall gets stretched so far that it will rupture.
*  It'll it'll just burst.
*  And now you have an arterial bleed.
*  So, you know what that you know, if someone shoots you in the femoral or stabs you in the
*  abdomen and you have an arterial bleed, you know, your life is measured in minutes or whatever
*  or hours. And if someone does you the favor of stabbing you in the abdomen and severing your
*  pancreatic artery, which is the artery that ruptured on me.
*  Now, it's a little artery, the thickness of a number two pencil.
*  It's not a big deal.
*  But if it's arterial blood, right.
*  I mean, you don't stop that shit.
*  You're going to die. Right.
*  And so if someone just like stabbed you in the abdomen, you rush to the hospital, the doc is no
*  problem. The doc, if you're still alive, they'll transfuse you.
*  The doctors know exactly where to sort of put their finger to plug the leak.
*  It's no problem. The problem with the internal hemorrhage, an abdominal hemorrhage is the doctors
*  have no idea where it is.
*  And your abdomen is basically a big bowl of spaghetti.
*  Right. Right.
*  And it's filling up with blood.
*  They have to find where it's leaking.
*  Yeah. Because the blood, you know, if you're stabbed, the blood's going out of your body onto the
*  kitchen floor with an internal hemorrhage.
*  It all stays in your abdomen.
*  So I it happened.
*  We were in a it was during Covid and we were in a remote area, an old house that we own at the end
*  of a dead end dirt road in Massachusetts.
*  And it's so remote.
*  There's no cell phone service.
*  The phone lines are old and they short out when it rains.
*  And we had my wife and I had a little bit of babysitting at the time, a three year old and a six month
*  old. We had a little baby, a little bit of babysitting from the teenage girls that lived, lived down the
*  road that we knew the family.
*  And so they came over to give us a few hours.
*  And my wife and I went out to this cabin that's even deeper in the woods and it's a paradise, basically.
*  Right. And so we're out there.
*  And in mid-sentence, I felt this sort of pain in my abdomen.
*  Like, oh, what was that?
*  Right. Like not kidney stone pain, but worse than indigestion.
*  Right. And so I sort of twisted and turned to see if I could work it out, you know, and then nothing
*  helped. And then I and then I finally stood up.
*  I mean, I can walk it out.
*  And as soon as I stood up, the floor just reeled away from me and I almost fell over.
*  What was happening is my blood pressure was just like tanking because I was losing all my blood into my
*  abdomen and my body hadn't compensated yet.
*  So I was just like.
*  Like, like my head was reeling.
*  Right. So I sat back down and I said something I never thought I'd ever have reason to say to my
*  wife. I said, something's wrong.
*  I'm going to need help.
*  Right. And you don't want to ever have to say those words.
*  Right. And you're fit, I'm fit.
*  It never crossed my mind that I would ever have to say that unless someone shoots me or something.
*  Right. Like, but not in my life.
*  I stopped war reporting.
*  You know, I gave all that gambling, you know, gambling with your life.
*  I gave it all up. I had a family.
*  We're in this beautiful spot.
*  Like, are you kidding?
*  It can come after you here, too.
*  Right. Who knew?
*  Right. So she dragged me through the woods.
*  You know, I have my arm around her shoulder.
*  I'm so stuck like a stumbling drunk.
*  Right. And she started dragging me through the woods and she gets me to the car and puts me in the passenger seat of the car.
*  And, you know, we're a one hour transport to the hospital.
*  Right. And I'm bleeding.
*  I'm losing a pint of blood every 10 or 15 minutes.
*  You know, my wife didn't know this.
*  And thank God I didn't either.
*  But I was literally a human hourglass.
*  Right. And she ran.
*  She put me in the passenger seat of the car and I'm lying there.
*  Now I'm starting to go blind.
*  Right. Which is one of the things that happens when you lose too much blood is you go you go blind.
*  She ran into the house.
*  The sort of electric white just took over the world.
*  And that's all I could see.
*  Electric white. That's the if you bleed out, that's the last thing you'll see.
*  And and then darkness, which is what I finally got to was the darkness.
*  But so she ran into the house, told the girls, the teenage girls, one of them ran out.
*  The phone line didn't work.
*  But the girl, one of them was able to go one bar of signal, like in one spot on the driveway, like one bar.
*  She called the ambulance and the ambulance guys came.
*  And you go into something called compensatory shock if you're bleeding out and the body senses in its in its miraculous way, it senses that, you know, there's a five alarm fire going on here and we got to tighten our tighten our game.
*  Right. So it literally shuts down vascular like blood flow to parts of the body you don't need, like your legs and your arms, your skin.
*  And it sort of hoards the blood in your chest, your abdomen, your chest and your brain around your heart.
*  Right. You know, those things go, you're dead.
*  So it collects the blood around there and keeps it there through muscular tension.
*  Right. You don't know you're doing this.
*  But what happens is your blood pressure goes back up and suddenly you're sort of back in the world.
*  And I was no longer going in and out of consciousness.
*  I was suddenly I could see again.
*  The ambulance guys get there and they're like, how are you doing?
*  I'm like, well, you know, belly pain, but I don't want to be a complainer here.
*  I'm feeling a little better.
*  You know, maybe blah, blah, blah.
*  My wife. And this is why there's a famous statistic.
*  Married men live longer.
*  My wife is like, you know what, because they were going to leave me.
*  They were like, oh, it's a hot day.
*  Drink some water. You probably just dehydrate.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yeah. My wife is like, no, he's going to the hospital.
*  I watched him. He was he was in and out of consciousness.
*  He couldn't stand up.
*  He was going blind.
*  Like, what's it take?
*  Yeah.
*  Guys, what's it take to get a guy to the emergency room?
*  So anyway, they took me.
*  My body stayed in compensatory shock for that hour that it took.
*  And but I was losing blood, losing blood, losing blood.
*  And then I got to the hospital and my body couldn't hold compensatory shock
*  anymore. And I went straight into end stage hemorrhagic shock, which is you're
*  dead in 10 or 15 minutes.
*  Right.
*  And I went off a fucking cliff right as we got to the hospital.
*  And I they estimate my blood pressure was 60 over 40, which is like rock
*  bottom. They estimate I lost like two thirds of my blood.
*  If you lose more than two thirds, even if they transfuse you and fill top you
*  off with, you know, full complement of blood, they pump it into you.
*  If you lose that much blood, there's complications that happen with coagulants
*  and all kinds of things like that that will kill you.
*  So you can people can die of blood loss with all with a full complement of blood
*  that they've gotten from transfusions just because this chemical process gets
*  initiated and they can't reverse it.
*  Right.
*  And that starts to happen when you've lost two thirds of your blood, which is
*  right where I was at.
*  Right.
*  Ten minutes later, I'd have been dead.
*  And so they rushed me into the trauma bay and the doctors knew immediately what
*  was going on.
*  And they one doctor had this sort of large gauge needle and he and he started
*  and she asked my permission.
*  I had no idea I was dying.
*  Right.
*  And he asked my permission to stick it through my neck into my jugular, which
*  didn't look like a lot of fun.
*  And I was like, really?
*  Is this is this totally necessary?
*  Like, we really need to do this.
*  I was like, why?
*  In case there's an emergency.
*  He was like, no, this is the emergency.
*  Like, I had no idea.
*  Right.
*  I'm I'm 10 minutes from dead.
*  I have no idea.
*  I'm dying zero.
*  Right.
*  Thank God.
*  Because I would have been terrified and I would have been thinking of my family.
*  And I would, you know, I mean, you know, like, yeah, you don't want that.
*  Right.
*  And so he said, this is the emergency.
*  I was like, well, if you say so, go ahead.
*  You have at it.
*  Right.
*  So while he's working on prepping my neck, and it did actually didn't hurt at all.
*  Right.
*  So if you ever have to have this done, don't worry about it.
*  But they, while I'm lying there and he sort of working on my neck getting, it
*  took long, it felt like it took longer than it probably actually did.
*  But while I'm there, all of a sudden, and I have to stop and say, I'm an atheist.
*  I'm a lifelong atheist.
*  I'm a rationalist.
*  I'm not spiritual.
*  I'm not missed a mystic.
*  I'm not woo woo.
*  I like, I'm nothing.
*  Right.
*  And my dad was an atheist and a physicist.
*  I have to say all this because of what's coming.
*  And I'm still an atheist by the way.
*  But so all of a sudden I sensed below me into my left, this black pit open up this
*  black abyss, like this infinite black void.
*  And I was getting pulled into it.
*  And it's not like darkness had taken over the world.
*  The world was here.
*  I could see the doctors.
*  I could see, I was talking to them, right?
*  I'm here I am.
*  But the darkness was contained in this hole that was underneath me and I was
*  getting pulled into it, right?
*  I didn't know I was dying, but I had this like this instinct of like a wounded
*  animal, like if I go into the pit, the infinitely dark pit, I'm not coming out.
*  Right.
*  Like I just sensed like, don't go in there because you're not coming back.
*  Right.
*  And I started to panic because I felt myself getting drawn in.
*  Right.
*  And then my father, my dead father appeared above me into my left.
*  Now there's a whole body of inquiry of NDEs, near death experiences, and I didn't
*  know anything about this stuff.
*  Right.
*  I didn't know anything about it.
*  It didn't interest me.
*  I'm not culturally prepped for anything like that.
*  I'm not Christian.
*  I didn't see angels.
*  Like I'm just, I'm a zero in that regard.
*  I'm a zero in that regard.
*  Right.
*  There's my dead father above me.
*  Right.
*  He'd been dead eight years.
*  I love him.
*  But I was not happy to see him.
*  Right.
*  I was like, I was shocked.
*  I mean, I was like, dad, what are you doing here?
*  Like, and there he was and he was, and he communicated to me.
*  And so what I saw, see isn't quite the right verb, but I don't know if there,
*  there doesn't exist the right verb.
*  I sensed slash saw him and it was his essence, his energy, his presence.
*  Right.
*  It's not like I see you, right?
*  It's like, oh, there we go.
*  Right.
*  It wasn't with that clarity.
*  In some ways it was with a deeper clarity because it was his essence.
*  Right.
*  And there he was, his presence was right there and above me and to my left.
*  It was like quite specific.
*  And he communicated to me again, not with words, but with some manner that I
*  understood that I can't quite explain what it was, but basically the idea was
*  you don't have to fight it.
*  You can come with me.
*  I'll take care of you.
*  It's okay.
*  It's okay.
*  Don't be scared.
*  Right.
*  I'll take care of you.
*  I was horrified.
*  I was appalled.
*  I was offended.
*  I was like, you're dead.
*  Why would I want to go with you?
*  You're dead.
*  You're the opposite of what I am.
*  Why would, why would I possibly want to go with you and be dead with you?
*  Because I'm alive with my family right now.
*  Like, I'm not going anywhere with you.
*  Like get out of here.
*  And I said to the doctor, you have to hurry.
*  I'm going right now.
*  I didn't know where I was going, but I knew I was sort of outbound.
*  And once that happened, I was, there's no inbound.
*  But I sensed that.
*  I said, you got to hurry.
*  You're losing me right now.
*  So what'd they do?
*  Well, they transfuse me.
*  They stabilize me with three units of blood.
*  And eventually I needed 10 units, which is a full compliment of blood.
*  Like, and so let me just pause for a moment and say, please donate blood.
*  Like everybody who's listening, I'm alive.
*  My daughters have a father because 10 people who I'll never know donated their
*  blood and when you donate blood, you are literally allowing another person to live.
*  And one day you might live because someone else donated blood and it's, you
*  know, doctors can't manufacture that shit.
*  Like if you donate blood, it takes an hour.
*  It doesn't hurt.
*  And your body will replace it in a couple of weeks.
*  It's the ultimate free lunch.
*  And I think it's quicker than a couple of weeks.
*  I think it's pretty quick.
*  It's pretty quick.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, to get up to a hundred percent, it's, I think it's a little long, but
*  whatever it doesn't, it doesn't matter.
*  Right?
*  It's like, we're talking about human life here.
*  And if you want to be part of something greater than yourself, it's blah, blah,
*  blah, blah, all these things that we all kind of want.
*  Like how do I participate?
*  You know, like, no, nobody needs me.
*  I'm not part of anything.
*  I feel lonely.
*  Give blood, man.
*  Then you'll be part of something amazing.
*  Right.
*  And you might, so I give blood regularly.
*  So at any rate, there's my pitch, but, um, so they, they, they, they stuff, stuff
*  some blood in me through my jugular.
*  I stabilized and they brought me to the interventional, the cath lab, the
*  interventional radiology suite.
*  And what interventional radiology is, it's a freaking miracle.
*  Right?
*  Like 20 years ago, I'd have been dead.
*  Right?
*  I mean, even the advances are so fast and so miraculous.
*  So what they do is they put you on something called a fluoroscope, which is
*  basically sees into you with X-rays, but it's X-ray video, right?
*  So they can see in real time what's going on in your body.
*  And then they pop a hole into your femoral from your right groin and they
*  insert a catheter into it, which is a flexible rubber tube or wire.
*  And because of the way these, the heads of these catheters are designed, they
*  can, they have little shepherd's crooks and little curves and all this stuff.
*  And they can navigate through your venous system, through the twists and turns.
*  And they can get that thing almost anywhere in your body.
*  And then once they're there, they can pop a coil and plug a leak or they can
*  inflate and put in a stent or whatever.
*  They could do miraculous things.
*  They can inject radioactive dye and then they see where it goes and they turn on
*  the fluoroscope and then they can see, ah, the dye is leaking into the abdomen from
*  here, here's where the leak is.
*  It's amazing what they can do.
*  Right.
*  And so they, they popped a, they popped the entry into my femoral and then
*  threaded a catheter and the, threaded a catheter up through my venous system.
*  And because of this ligament that's in the wrong place, the, my, my, the
*  arteries in my abdomen are very distorted.
*  Right.
*  And they're tortuous, called tortuous.
*  And they couldn't get the catheter through these twists and turns.
*  Right.
*  And, um, they couldn't get it to the site of the bleed, which they knew where it was.
*  Right.
*  And they couldn't get the catheter there.
*  The alternative, if you can't fix it with a catheter is you pull your gear out and
*  you send the guy to the OR and you do this crazy like race against time, but you
*  cut them open and then all of that.
*  One of the reasons the blood loss slows down is that there's so much blood in
*  your abdomen that there's back pressure and it keeps, it slows down the blood loss
*  from your artery because now it's trying to flow into a full container and it
*  doesn't leak as fast.
*  Right.
*  So as soon as you open up the abdomen, you can imagine what happens.
*  I mean, you guys are blood and you know, you got to like push the organs aside.
*  And it's this desperate search for the bleed before you bleed out.
*  And as you can probably guess, it doesn't go well very often.
*  Right.
*  So it's not quite a death sentence, but if you go into the OR with an abdominal
*  bleed, you know, they, they bring your wife in to say goodbye to you basically
*  before you do that.
*  They don't tell you or her that, but that's what they're doing.
*  And that's what they would have done with my wife who finally, who got to the
*  hospital, the ER doctor was like, you better come now.
*  And so, so at one point, I mean, agonizing pain, cause I've got all this free
*  floating blood against my kidneys and my liver and my spleen and just agonize like
*  kidney stones, right?
*  It's just, I mean, agony and they can't sedate me.
*  Cause my vitals are too low.
*  Right.
*  So I'm conscious through all this and I'm watching the doctors.
*  And at one point I watched one of the doctors just sort of give, shake his
*  head and shrug and was basically like, well, we tried this isn't working.
*  And the other doctor nodded and he was like, yeah, we tried.
*  And it was the first moment where I realized, Oh my God, I didn't realize
*  this is, we're playing for keeps right now.
*  This might not turn out well.
*  I might not be going home.
*  I couldn't believe what I'd seen.
*  And then the first doctor who's this brilliant interventional radiologist
*  named Dr.
*  Phil Dombrowski, he saved my life.
*  You have in your mind, a special relationship with someone, a man who, or
*  it was anyone who has saved your life.
*  It's a very particular relationship and that I've never been in that position
*  before.
*  And so Dombrowski said, we can try one last thing.
*  Let's try going through his left wrist.
*  And so what, because of your vasculature, like the left wrist allows a different
*  point of attack.
*  You come down from above instead of coming up from below and you don't have
*  to go through all those twists and turns.
*  And, um, he had to get through a problematic spot in my celiac artery
*  that was impeded by the ligament.
*  That's in the wrong place where he was a lot of problems, right?
*  And you had to be like a super high level IR guy to even think of this, much
*  less do it.
*  Like I was told to very, very few, few interventional radiologists would even
*  think of doing this, right?
*  But he was, he was a genius, right?
*  So the other doctor said, I like the way you think.
*  And I watched them put a catheter into my left, uh, in my left wrist.
*  I still, I no longer have a pulse in that wrist cause it messes up the artery.
*  And, um, and they did it.
*  They got the thing to the place.
*  Like they got, they got the catheter to the bleed.
*  They popped a coil in there.
*  It blocked the, it blocked the artery, blocked the leak.
*  And, um, then they sent me to the ICU.
*  They knocked me out, sent me to the ICU.
*  I remember seeing my wife very briefly afterwards.
*  I held her hand and, and, um, that sent me off and I woke up in the ICU the
*  next morning.
*  And so the blood in your abdomen, do they drain it?
*  Does your body absorb it?
*  No, I guess maybe they do sometimes.
*  I know your body absorbs it.
*  Wow.
*  Yep.
*  Six pints of blood, like, and you know, I could feel it in me.
*  I mean, it didn't feel good, right?
*  You know, and you're sort of discolored.
*  I mean, it's like, it's awful.
*  Not a good look.
*  Right.
*  Now, the, you keep, uh, saying you're an atheist.
*  What does, what exactly, how do you, everybody sort of defines that differently.
*  I feel like a lot of atheists are actually agnostic more than they're atheists.
*  Cause an atheist is someone who just doesn't believe.
*  I don't believe.
*  What do you think the experience with your father was that his presence?
*  Well, that's right.
*  Then the billion dollar question, right?
*  So I'm an atheist in part because I respect the, um, the highest intentions
*  of religion too much to take them lightly.
*  Now there's a plenty of religious expression, which is not at a very high
*  level, which I find even offensive and destructive, but at its, at its best,
*  like journalism, like psychology, like everything at its best, right?
*  It's a very noble, uh, thing that, that helps people live with more dignity
*  and less fear and blah, blah, blah.
*  Right.
*  So I get it.
*  So, so I take that stuff really literally.
*  And so for me, believing in God is an active thing.
*  Right.
*  And, and really it's not like that you found God, it's God found you.
*  Like, Oh my God, suddenly God was in my life.
*  Right.
*  And, and it's like, when you fall in love, you can't choose to fall in love.
*  Right.
*  It's an overwhelming feeling that you can't resist.
*  And if it's not, you're not really in love, bro, you might've married Betty,
*  but you're not in love with Betty.
*  Right.
*  But when you, you know, when you have that experience of overwhelming love,
*  like, Oh my God, I'm in love with that person.
*  I got to be with them.
*  My life is with them.
*  Like that's love finding you.
*  You didn't manufacture it and you didn't make an executive decision.
*  Well, I'm in love with Betty now and we're getting married.
*  I mean, people used to do that and it just isn't love.
*  It's a contract.
*  It's a decision.
*  It's an arrangement.
*  No problem.
*  Right.
*  And so what I can't do is make an executive.
*  When people say, you got to find God, you got to find Jesus.
*  I'd listen, man, even if I wanted to, which I don't, but even I wanted to,
*  it doesn't work that way.
*  Right.
*  I can't just decide to love God.
*  It's not, that's not a feeling that you can summon and dictate to yourself.
*  So I'm an atheist because I don't, I don't make God a sort of part of my daily
*  practice.
*  It's not part of my life.
*  It just isn't right.
*  And I can't just choose to make it be.
*  I could fake it and I could go to church every Sunday, but I respect religion in
*  its best form too much to frigging fake it.
*  Right.
*  So, and I'm not an agnostic because.
*  You know, if I, if I saw in my mind, agnostic is like a hung jury, right?
*  It's like, you know what?
*  I don't know.
*  There could be a God, there might not be a God.
*  I, I don't have an opinion on it.
*  Right.
*  In a hung jury, you might be innocent and I might be guilty.
*  You know, we can't, your honor, we can't decide either way and we can make an
*  argument for both.
*  So what it's a hung jury.
*  You're like, we can't, we don't, we don't know.
*  Right.
*  In the legal system, that means he's innocent.
*  If you can't come to a decision of guilt, then he's innocent.
*  Right.
*  But so in the, in the sort of agnostic sense, like there's evidence for, evidence
*  against, I don't, I can't decide.
*  So I'm an agnostic and, but for me, there is no evidence that there is a God.
*  I mean, there's belief, right.
*  Which is a beautiful thing, but I've never in my life actually seen something happen
*  where it's like, Oh my God, there went God.
*  I just saw him.
*  Holy shit.
*  Like, are you kidding?
*  Like there he is.
*  Like now I believe there's a God.
*  Had I, while I was dying, had God come to me, whatever that would even look like,
*  right, whatever that is, had God come to me afterwards, I'm like, you know what?
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe there is a God.
*  Right.
*  Because I saw some strange shit and that's the only explanation I can think of is that
*  there actually is a divine power in the world.
*  I encountered it.
*  It changed my life.
*  Like, even if I'm not religious, I'm at least agnostic, but I've never,
*  that's never happened to me.
*  Right.
*  So I'm not an agnostic because I just, I have no reason to think there is a God.
*  It never happens.
*  Right.
*  I'm an atheist.
*  Right.
*  So I'm happy to be staying corrected if someone offers up some proof, but it
*  thus far it hasn't happened.
*  And when people say, you know what, the proof of God is that the universe exists.
*  Who created the universe motherfucker?
*  Like, who do you think it has to be God?
*  Right.
*  And I'm like, well, not really.
*  Like, because if complex systems need a creator and that's your proof of God,
*  clearly God is a complex system that's at least as complex as the university created.
*  So who created God?
*  Like that will not get you, that doesn't prove anything.
*  Right.
*  So that's the, so the theology, the theology aside, like, what did I make of
*  my father appearing above me?
*  Right.
*  So, um, the next morning to get in there, I have to sort of say what happened to me.
*  Right.
*  And if I may, um, the next morning I woke up in the ICU to the nurse saying, um,
*  good morning, Mr.
*  Younger, congratulations.
*  You made it.
*  Like it's a miracle.
*  We almost lost you last night and no one can quite believe you're alive.
*  It's, um, you know, welcome back to the world.
*  Basically, I cannot tell you how shocking it is to get news like that.
*  If you had no idea you were dying.
*  I mean, I knew I had something was going on with me, belly pain.
*  Maybe I'm going to wake up to shitty news about a tumor, you know, cancer might,
*  you know, whatever.
*  I mean, I, I was aware that this might not be a fun day tomorrow.
*  I had no idea I was dying in that moment.
*  Right.
*  So it's absolutely shocking.
*  So that I, and particularly if you have children, right.
*  And my little girl, I immediately thought about my little girls.
*  And then I remembered my father.
*  I'm like, Oh my God, my, I saw my father last night and the pit, right.
*  All came back to me and I didn't know what to do with it.
*  I was Jesus.
*  Like, are you kidding?
*  What was that?
*  And, um, so I'm left there with my thoughts.
*  I'm throwing up blood.
*  I'm a freaking mess.
*  Right.
*  And then the nurse comes back later and says, how are you doing?
*  Like, not that great, frankly, like thanks to you.
*  What you told me is terrifying.
*  Like, I can't stop thinking about it.
*  And I almost died.
*  And, and she said, try this.
*  She had an awesome Boston accent.
*  She was like one of these, she was sort of middle-aged lady, like, like heart of
*  gold, straight shooter, tough as nails, buried three husbands, you know, whatever.
*  She's one of those ICU nurses, right.
*  I liked her enormously.
*  And she, and she was like, try this, uh, instead of thinking about it, like
*  something scary, try thinking about it, like something sacred walked out, like a
*  hell of a thing to say to an atheist.
*  Right.
*  So, you know, for me, all those wonderful words, like blessing and, and, and
*  sacred, they, you know, they have one, they have beautiful secular meanings as
*  well.
*  So I feel entitled to interpret them in my own way.
*  And for me, you know, say something sacred is anything that allows it, as I
*  was saying before, any, any, any work, any task, any knowledge, anything that
*  allows people to live with more dignity, with less fear, more connection, more
*  love that just helps the human condition a little bit, like that's, that's sacred
*  knowledge, right?
*  You know, it could be a minister, right?
*  It could be a shrink.
*  It could be a journalist, right?
*  It could be, you could be doing sacred work for people.
*  I'm sure you are.
*  And so, you know, the things that you say are helping people navigate their
*  painful lives again, bro.
*  Absolutely.
*  We're all capable of sacred work, right?
*  That's what it means to me.
*  So when she said that I'm like, okay, I've been going to frontlines my whole life
*  and coming back with knowledge that, you know, in my, in my most grandiose
*  moments, right?
*  I thought might help humanity.
*  Like what's going on in you.
*  No, I wasn't in Ukraine, but right now, like what's going on in Ukraine?
*  What knowledge can we come back with that will help the world and the United
*  States make better decisions about how to preserve human dignity and human life?
*  Like whatever that, whatever that means, right?
*  So that's, that's at its best.
*  That's sort of a sacred task like many others are.
*  And so, and now I'm not going to frontlines anymore.
*  I went to the ultimate front line.
*  I went to my own mortality, the place, the front line we're all headed to and
*  that most of us are scared of.
*  Like, and I was allowed to look over the edge.
*  And then I came back.
*  I was allowed to come back.
*  Did I come back with sacred knowledge?
*  In other words, with knowledge that would be helpful to me and to other people
*  lead their lives and with less fear, more dignity, et cetera.
*  And that was the challenge.
*  And I set about doing it at that moment.
*  I've just laid there.
*  I was like, all right, what did I learn?
*  What did I learn?
*  And the big question that I had to answer for myself was what the hell did I see
*  with my father?
*  Like, what was that?
*  And does that mean that there's something quote more, right?
*  Is there something after we die that we can sort of like look forward to and
*  count on or is it just the dying brain hallucinating some shit because we're so
*  friggin scared and the, you know, the synapses are shorting out and it's going
*  haywire and that's what you get.
*  You see some weird stuff, right?
*  Like, which is it?
*  And so I started researching NDEs, near death experiences, and there's a whole
*  body of literature, a whole body of knowledge, and frankly, a whole cottage
*  industry, somewhat shameless cottage industry around that, you know, proof of
*  heaven, blah, blah, blah.
*  But, you know, the flakiness aside, there's some legit, you know, there's a,
*  it's very, very common.
*  And the NDEs that people have had, thousands of cases of them from all over
*  the world, different societies, different cultures, even different ages.
*  There are historical accounts of this.
*  And the interesting thing about them, if you give a room full of people LSD, they
*  all have a wide variety of hallucinations.
*  And we know how that works, right?
*  We know what happens in the brain when you take LSD, no big mystery there, and
*  they'll hallucinate a whole bunch of crazy stuff, right?
*  With NDEs, what's sort of strange is that the experiences are, there aren't infinite
*  number of them, right?
*  It's not like some people see ham sandwiches and other people see kangaroos,
*  right?
*  It's like they fall into some, some like three or four basic buckets, right?
*  And that's across culture throughout, you know, throughout the history and which
*  sort of argues for a sort of seminal, a seminal human experience rather than just
*  a sort of function of brain chemistry and drug, and essentially drugs, right?
*  Endogenous drugs being released in your brain in your final moments.
*  And so there are a lot of people, very well-credentialed, smart people who are
*  like, listen, these accounts amount to evidence of an afterlife, right?
*  Sorry, like that there's so many of them.
*  They're so consistent.
*  How do you explain this shit?
*  Like, come on, right?
*  And then there's other people, well-credentialed, equally smart, et cetera,
*  et cetera, like nonsense.
*  I'm a neuroscientist.
*  I'm a neurochemist.
*  You know, like we can explain all this through, you know, you put fighter pilots
*  in a human centrifuge, spin them to five G's, they will see a tunnel of light.
*  They will see God.
*  They will experience their entire life in one moment, blah, blah, blah.
*  You know, epileptic, same thing with brain seizures.
*  Like we can reproduce all of this in the lab.
*  Like this isn't evidence of anything.
*  But isn't the problem with that, that you're actually killing a person when you're
*  just spinning them into centrifuge?
*  No, no, no.
*  They do this with fighter pilots.
*  Right.
*  But you know, if you keep doing that, you'll die.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  And your body knows that too.
*  So you are in a near death experience.
*  You're near death.
*  Well, you're near death because blood's not getting to your chest.
*  And your body knows that.
*  I mean, you are opening that door.
*  Whether you're opening that door in a safe manner, you're still opening that door.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  You're right.
*  But the argument for you're absolutely right.
*  And I never thought of it that way.
*  But the argument by the scientists, the rationalists is look, we can, we can
*  reproduce all of this in the, in the lab.
*  Yeah, but it's a dumb argument because what you're doing in reproducing it is
*  bringing someone close to death.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Well, another thing they can do is stimulate the brain in during brain surgery.
*  And they do that to make sure that they're not scooping out the scooping out tumor,
*  not, you know, your, your piano lessons or whatever.
*  Right.
*  And one of the things they can do is they stimulate certain parts of the brain.
*  They can give people a sensation that they're floating or that they, oh my
*  God, my, my grandfather, you know, whatever they can do weird shit with the brain.
*  With, you know, a tooth, basically a toothpick and a, and a, and a, and a
*  bone saw, right.
*  And, and so at any rate, just, just suffice it to say there's a, there's the sort of
*  slightly mystical argument of this is proof of an afterlife.
*  And then there's the sort of rationalist argument.
*  No, no, no.
*  We, we, we understand the physiology of all this.
*  And so there was a guy in, I think it was Estonia, an older guy who fell and
*  hit his head, had a hematoma.
*  They put electrodes on his scalp to see what the brain activity was.
*  Cause he was having seizures.
*  Other stuff happened to him that the family said, you know, he doesn't have a
*  chance of recuperating, pull the, you basically pull the plug, let him die.
*  He had the, um, the electrodes on his, on his brain, monitoring brain activity
*  before the decision to pull the plug.
*  So they did something that would otherwise not be ethical.
*  If someone's going to die, you're like, Hey, let's hook them up to see what his
*  brain does.
*  It's not ethical, right?
*  This guy already had that stuff in place as part of the life-saving measures.
*  So they were able to see what happened at the moment of death.
*  Right?
*  So what happened in the human brain, in his brain was that there was a flood of
*  I think it was, um, gamma in his brain that, um, uh, that is associated with
*  long-term memory, a flood of gamma in his brain, right?
*  And, uh, and that was, uh, and one other frequency, I can't remember it at any
*  rate, there was this, the brain did basically did what brains do when they're
*  remembering very, very old stuff.
*  Right.
*  And that they even found that in rats that they ethically are able to kill, like
*  hook them up, kill them.
*  What happens in the brain?
*  Right.
*  And so the, the most ancient sort of memory, memory source centers of the brain are
*  activated at the moment of death while there's a sort of lingering dying
*  consciousness.
*  So boom, all of a sudden you're five and you're talking to your grandfather, you
*  know, whatever, whatever it is, we don't know what the specific things that that
*  man saw, but we know that the, his brain was activated in ways that suggest
*  memory retrieval.
*  Right.
*  So the rationalist is like, okay, the brain dies.
*  All of a sudden you'd see your, you know, you have these old memories.
*  Right.
*  So, um, now the, for me, as I, as I read, so I got, so I got home, so I was a
*  rather convoluted story, but hopefully it's interesting.
*  So I got home, I was a week in the hospital was surprised everybody.
*  But I'm, I'm the reason I survived at all was that I'm a fit athletic person.
*  And so I gave the, some of the doctors, some of the work with, it also meant that
*  I recovered quite quickly.
*  So instead of three weeks in the ICU, I was five days and then boom, I'm out of
*  there.
*  Right.
*  And so I came home and it's, you know, it's not the kind of party you would expect.
*  Right.
*  Like I came home and I was like, woohoo, I'm alive.
*  I made it, blah, blah, blah.
*  It's like, Oh my God, I almost died on a totally ordinary day.
*  And it could happen again.
*  This also could be the day that I die.
*  Right.
*  Maybe I have another aneurysm, like we don't know.
*  And I completely freaked myself out.
*  It was a classic post-trauma like anxiety, panic reaction.
*  Like it was all, all very classic.
*  It was way worse than combat, way worse.
*  Right.
*  And, but one of the problems, I started to have the sense that I wasn't really
*  there and then maybe I had died, which sounds freaky, but apparently it's
*  quite common in people that almost die that they get, they're seized with this
*  fear that they're actually a ghost and they didn't make it.
*  I know it sounds insane.
*  And you're right.
*  But I can just tell you, like I sincerely had that worry.
*  It was the ultimate panic disorder, right?
*  Like that you're dead.
*  Like what, is there anything bigger to panic about that you're actually dead?
*  So, and the pro the reason I had that, and this gets to another rather mysterious,
*  slightly woo woo part of this whole story is that two days prior, you know, I
*  had no idea, obviously that I had something that was going to kill me in my abdomen.
*  Um, I had no conscious idea, but two days prior at dawn, my family and I, we, we
*  coast, we still coast sleep.
*  And so we sleep in a group on a pad on the floor and we sleep as a family, the four of us.
*  And so at dawn on the previous night, so 36 hours prior to almost dying, I was woken
*  by this horrific nightmare, the worst nightmare I've ever had and I've ever heard
*  of, and the nightmare was this, that I was hovering above my family and they were crying
*  in grief and I was waving to them.
*  They were crying in grief that I died and I was waving to them.
*  I was like, I'm over here.
*  I'm right here.
*  I was shouting, I was waving my arms and they couldn't hear me.
*  They couldn't see me and I didn't know why.
*  And then I was made to understand in the same way that my father communicated with me.
*  It was just a sort of transmission of knowledge, right?
*  I was made to understand that they couldn't hear me because I'm dead.
*  I'm a go, I'm a spirit.
*  I'm not there and I'm above them and I'll be going now.
*  I'm out.
*  You're Mr.
*  Younger, you're outbound and you're not coming back.
*  It's too late.
*  You can't go back.
*  It's over.
*  And I was so anguished that it woke me up and I woke up next to my, I happened to
*  be next to my oldest daughter and I just like clutched her like a stuffy.
*  Like I was like, Oh my God, thank God.
*  Cause it really felt like I was dead.
*  Thank God.
*  That was just a dream.
*  I'm actually here.
*  I'm alive.
*  Right.
*  So then, you know, 36 hours later, Ooh, what's that pain in my abdomen off to the
*  hospital almost, almost die.
*  Doctors have later told me not the doctors have saved me, but other doctors who were
*  were honest with me, like it's a miracle you're alive.
*  Right.
*  Like it's a, it isn't just, Oh, good.
*  Well done.
*  It's a freaking miracle.
*  Like 10 slices of Swiss cheese, 10 holes have in the lineup and you threaded the
*  needle through those holes.
*  Right.
*  Like, so I got back home and I was super emotional.
*  Every time I heard a siren, I'd start crying.
*  Like, I mean, I mean, I was just a freaking mess.
*  Right.
*  And, um, and then I thought, Oh my God, I died in my sleep.
*  That, and that, that dream.
*  Cause I started to read about NDEs and one of the most common is that you're
*  hovering above your family.
*  Another is that you see a dead relative.
*  Right.
*  So like, Oh my God.
*  And I knew nothing, none of this.
*  Right.
*  So, Oh my God, that wasn't, that wasn't a dream.
*  That was my experience of actually dying.
*  Right.
*  The kind of experience that many people who almost died and were say, were
*  rest, you know, resuscitated report having had, I was hovering above my family.
*  And I died and I died in my sleep.
*  My wife woke up next to her dead husband.
*  It's over.
*  I just don't know because I'm having, I'm in the middle of a dying hallucination.
*  I'm a ghost.
*  I'm not here.
*  I think my daughter's talking to me.
*  I think she's on my lap.
*  I'm not bro.
*  You're not here, man.
*  You're like, just face it.
*  Right.
*  And you know, you can't disprove it.
*  Right.
*  And if you're crazy enough, it actually feels like it might be what's happening.
*  And I was plenty crazy enough for this.
*  Right.
*  And I'm not a naturally neurotic person, but it turned me into one for a while.
*  Right.
*  And I know at one point I went to my wife, like, honey, just tell me I'm
*  really here that I survived.
*  We're here.
*  We're good.
*  Like, just tell me.
*  He said, of course you're here.
*  You survive.
*  You know, etc.
*  But my mind were like, that's exactly what a hallucination would tell you.
*  Right.
*  And, um, I was inching towards madness.
*  Right.
*  And so, so finally, so sorry, long, long, you know, long story, just to sort
*  of finally answer your question.
*  Um, what I, where I landed, you know, I'm sorry, I'm reading the NDE stuff and
*  the sort of like, the scaredy cat in me is like, Oh, wow, that's pretty convincing.
*  Like maybe, maybe there is an afterlife.
*  Maybe we don't have to be worried.
*  Like, wow, how pleasant, right?
*  How pleasant to think like that.
*  There's something to go on to, right?
*  Nothing to scare, nothing to be scared of.
*  And then I, then I read afterwards the sort of like, you know, party poopers,
*  right?
*  Just sort of like the rationalists come in like nonsense.
*  We can explain all this.
*  It's all neurochemistry.
*  Like there's no freaking afterlife.
*  Like, come on.
*  So, and because of partly because of the father I grew up with, like who really
*  valued rationalism, like I was like, Oh well, you know, nice try, like, you know,
*  close, but no cigar.
*  Oh well, I guess when we're dead, we're dead.
*  And so then the one thing that didn't quite make sense was that there's this
*  incredible consistency in people.
*  Like an enormous percentage of the time.
*  And I can't remember off the top of my head, but quite a large percentage of the
*  time, the dying people who have NDEs and are resuscitated and report their
*  memories, like I was, I was able to.
*  They are received by the dead, right?
*  The dead come to receive them.
*  Sometimes it's your father.
*  Sometimes it's a friend who died decades earlier.
*  Sometimes it's someone that you might not even like very much, but the dead come
*  to receive the dying in the way that my father did.
*  You know, my mind, I'm like, I don't know, you know, like I get it.
*  You give everyone LSD and they all have hallucinations and the dying brain
*  produces hallucinations, but it's sort of odd, like, okay, you stir up the memory
*  banks of the brain when you die with the gamma and all that stuff.
*  So, all right.
*  So suddenly I'm five years old and we're playing by the swimming pool.
*  And now suddenly I'm, you know, I'm camping with my buddy at 12 and so, yeah,
*  there's a whole array of memories.
*  That's different than dad showing up.
*  Like dad showing up saying, come with me into the afterlife.
*  That's not exactly memory recall, right?
*  That's something, that's something else.
*  Right.
*  So, and then I started talking to hospice nurses and, um, it's super common
*  experience, older people, the people dying of cancer in their last days and hours.
*  What are they doing?
*  They're having conversations with people in the room that no one else can see.
*  They're having conversations with the dead who are clearly there to take them.
*  Like, it's okay.
*  Come with me.
*  It happened to my mother.
*  She suddenly scowled in her last hour.
*  She scowled and looked up at the coroner and was like, what's he doing here?
*  And she had a terrible relationship with her brother who had died in his fifties,
*  you know, like decades earlier.
*  Right.
*  And I just guessed, I was like, mom, that's uncle George and he's come a very long way
*  to see you and you have to be nice to him.
*  And she frowned and she said, we'll see about that.
*  It continues into the afterlife, right?
*  Oh my God.
*  It's not over when you die.
*  Right.
*  It goes on.
*  Right.
*  There's a sequel to this.
*  Right.
*  So, so these, these visits are not necessarily a sort of benevolent, like,
*  oh, the dying, you know, sort of needs some kind of comfort and they manufacture a
*  vision of a loved one to make them feel better.
*  It's not quite that either.
*  And then there's super poignant stories.
*  I talked to a hospice nurse who, who was taking care of an older
*  gentleman who was dying painlessly, you know, no morphine at all.
*  So of clear mind, right.
*  You know, in his eighties or seven seventies or eighties and, and in his last,
*  you know, 12 hours or so, he suddenly, the nurse that I talked to said that the man
*  looked and he was like, Barbara, Oh my God, you know, it's so good to see you.
*  Like, Oh, thank God you're here.
*  You know, like, so the nurse who's been through this a million times says, okay,
*  he's in his last hours now.
*  Well, this is the, this is the end game.
*  Right.
*  Thank God because he's dying and it's, you know, like needs to resolve.
*  And so she went into the kitchen where the wife was and said, I think we're in
*  the last stages because he's, he's wrecking, you know, he's, he's seen,
*  he's seeing someone in the room.
*  He seems very, very happy to see her.
*  It's someone named Barbara.
*  Does that name mean anything to you?
*  So the wife says, yes, that was his one true love.
*  So of course the nurse is like, Oh my God, I stepped in it.
*  Right.
*  And then she goes, that was our 19 year old.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Right.
*  I mean, how do you start tell that story and not start crying?
*  Right.
*  I mean, it's like, so that kind of story is super, super common.
*  So in my mind, right, I'm like, okay, I buy the, I buy the centrifuge.
*  I buy the, you know, like endogenous DMT and the blah, blah, the gamma.
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  What I don't understand is the consistency of the visions of the dead coming to,
*  and like my father did, I mean, you, you, um, I get that we hallucinate in times
*  of extreme stress, but not that I don't get the content being consistent across
*  cultures, across ages, manners of death, like on and on, like, really?
*  Like, how do you like, so to me, that doesn't prove there's a quote afterlife,
*  but it raises a legitimate question.
*  Like, what is it we're talking about here?
*  And so where I land, and I promise I won't like drag us into a long conversation
*  about quantum physics, but you know, basically the, the, the rational,
*  the, the, the argument that's both rational and open-minded, uh, and my
*  mind has been enormously open by this experience, not to God, but to maybe we
*  just don't understand the nature of existence completely, right?
*  It's been open to that.
*  So the, the rational and open-minded explanation for some of this stuff, uh,
*  if you don't dismiss it, if you don't dismiss it as just neurochemistry, and
*  you're not going to go whole hog on, well, you know, God exists, thank hallelujah.
*  If you're not going to do either of those two things, the conversation that
*  I think can be had is maybe there is some sort of post-death existence at the
*  sort of quantum, meaning the subatomic level that we just don't understand.
*  And, uh, some post-death existence for the individual and not necessarily
*  post-death consciousness.
*  We're not on a hammock with a daiquiri.
*  You know, it's not like, you know, those are human projections, right?
*  But like, but maybe at the quantum level, we just don't quite understand
*  what death is, what reality is, what consciousness is.
*  And one of the, so my father was a physicist and my, um, just weirdly, my
*  great aunt had a long passionate affair with Schrodinger, the physicist who
*  Schrodinger's cat, right?
*  And one of the mysteries of quantum physics, and I'm sure you've come into
*  this in your, you know, in your studies and your research and your conversations.
*  You know, one of the profound mysteries of quantum physics that was sort of
*  broken wide open about a hundred years ago by people like Schrodinger and, and,
*  um, and Heisenberg, um, that when you observe a subatomic particle, it acts
*  differently than if you don't observe it.
*  Right.
*  So you create basically the act of concert conscious observation.
*  Like if I, you know, if I look at that ashtray, the ashtray does exactly what
*  it does if I don't look at it, right?
*  In the macroscopic world, conscious observation doesn't change anything.
*  Right.
*  At the, in the subatomic world, it changes everything.
*  Right.
*  So a subatomic particle and electron is in all positions as a, as a statistical
*  probability, it's in all positions until you observe it and then it's in one
*  position, right?
*  If you fire a photon at two slits in a metal plate with some photographic film
*  on the other side to mark where the photon hits, if you fire the photon at a
*  plate with two slits is the famous double slit experiment.
*  Fire the photon at two slits and monet actively monitor it with a photon
*  detector while it's moving, it will go through one slit and hit the strike
*  plate on the far side with a signature of like passage through one slit.
*  Right.
*  If you fire a photon through two slits and don't monitor it, it simultaneously
*  goes through both slits and leaves a signature on the other side of having
*  done so, right?
*  In other words, and this is the, one of the deepest mysteries of, of existence,
*  right?
*  At the quantum level, our act of observation creates the reality that we
*  are observing and that if we don't observe it, it's another reality, right?
*  So given that deep, unresolvable mystery, is it possible in the sort of like the
*  electrons in all places at once until we watch it and then it's in one place in
*  that sort of basic sense of a profound mystery at the quantum level, is it
*  possible that there's an equivalent mystery around biological death, the
*  existence of consciousness, which people still don't understand, right?
*  Well, they can't even define what it is exactly, right?
*  Is there a mystery around that that we not only don't understand, can't
*  understand, and one of the theories, super, and I'll end with this, but it's
*  just, it's a super out there theory.
*  It's called biocentrism.
*  There's a guy named Adam Lanza that you might be interested in talking to.
*  He's a brilliant guy.
*  He's one of the sort of pioneers of biocentrism.
*  And basically what he's saying is that, look, if consciousness determines reality
*  at the quantum level and the universe ultimately is a quantum, is a quantum
*  reality, it's possible that consciousness is part of that, that there's a subatomic
*  particle associated with consciousness, just like the Higgs boson is associated
*  with gravity, like gravity exists because of the Higgs boson.
*  It's a subatomic particle that we can measure, right?
*  And maybe consciousness is in the same way, is part of the physical existence
*  of the universe, without gravity, there is no universe.
*  There's no nothing, right?
*  It's essential to existence.
*  And maybe consciousness is essential to the existence of the universe in
*  the singular form that it takes.
*  And it landed in the singular form with the arrival of consciousness.
*  Maybe it's all one in the same thing.
*  And that actually coincides quite nicely with Schrodinger, who was of the
*  opinion that there was a universal consciousness.
*  There was a kind of colossus of consciousness that we are all a tiny part
*  of, and when we die, we return to it, right?
*  On some quantum level that no one has any freaking idea.
*  As I say in my book, we might understand reality about as well as a dog understands
*  a TV screen, like with absolutely no concept of the machinery, the mechanisms,
*  the processes that produce the flickering images that are in front of us.
*  We might, like the dog doesn't have that understanding of what it's looking at.
*  We might not have an understanding of the cosmos that creates the system that
*  creates the reality that we are seeing and that we think is existence.
*  Yeah, I'm entitled to believe that we're entirely too arrogant in our understanding
*  of what we know and that we have a very limited amount of information, even
*  though it's incredibly complex for our understanding.
*  For our understanding, the leaps and bounds that we have made since using leeches
*  to treat diseases is off the charts, right?
*  And you're a living testament to it.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think it is a very, very shallow understanding of an infinite thing
*  that's happening all the time.
*  Have you ever seen, they just recently made images of quantum entangled photons?
*  No, I mean, I know about quantum entanglement, another great mystery.
*  I haven't seen the images.
*  Spooky action in the distance.
*  Yeah.
*  Take a look at what this looks like.
*  Quantum entangled photons look like a yin yang, like exactly.
*  Oh, awesome.
*  Exactly.
*  That's it.
*  That's a quantum entangled photon.
*  Oh my god.
*  Are you kidding?
*  Oh my god.
*  Each one contains at its center a bit of the other.
*  Exactly.
*  So maybe someone knew this thousands and thousands of years ago.
*  The idea that the Chinese or whoever created that initial symbol, the idea that they just
*  stumbled accidentally upon an actual image of quantum entangled photons, very unlikely.
*  That just seems too insane and too amazing.
*  That's fascinating.
*  Fascinating, right?
*  And to find that out, when was that discovered, Jamie?
*  Was that very recently?
*  I saw it in some science.
*  I think it was like last year.
*  Okay.
*  Entanglement has been around for decades, but those images are just recently, that's stunning.
*  Stunning.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think this whole thing that, oh, we know what's going on in the brain.
*  Oh, we know the human neurochemicals that get,
*  oh, we know we can stimulate the brain.
*  Oh, we know we can stick you in a centrifuge.
*  You don't know shit.
*  We are at the edge of a vast forest and we're peering in and we're arrogant.
*  And we're arrogant because the people that know know more than everybody else.
*  The people that do have an understanding of human neurochemistry and do have an understanding
*  of how the body works know far more than I do, know far more than most people do.
*  So they have an arrogance of this understanding, this rational sort of reductionist perspective
*  of what reality is.
*  I think it's nonsense.
*  Well, listen, the physicists that give them their due, they are the branch of science,
*  which is actually fully aware of the drop off where the mystery begins,
*  knowledge ends and the mystery begins.
*  They could not explain this stuff when it happened.
*  It actually unsettled those guys, Schrodinger and Einstein and Eisenberg and all.
*  It really quite unsettled them.
*  They were like, whoa, what are we unfolding here?
*  Are we sure we want to unfold this, uncover this?
*  And once Sir Arthur Eddington said this wonderful thing, he was asked about these sort of central
*  mysteries of quantum physics and the universe.
*  And he said, something that we don't know is doing, we know not what.
*  That's a good way to put it.
*  Yeah, there's some humility right now.
*  At its core, quantum physics, there's a mystery at the core of quantum physics,
*  equivalent to the mystery at the core of religion.
*  At the end of the day, religion is an act of faith.
*  And you can't answer these questions rationally.
*  And at the end of the day, the physicists themselves will say, look, we just don't know.
*  These test results make no sense in the macroscopic rational world that we live in every day.
*  The macroscopic and the subatomic world, they're completely opposite to each other.
*  The laws of physics are completely different at the macroscopic level and the subatomic level.
*  Yeah.
*  And just the fact that if you look at atoms themselves, it's mostly empty space.
*  What the fuck is going on?
*  Oh, that's right.
*  There's all of this.
*  We have a cursory understanding of something that's infinitely complex.
*  We have an understanding of it and far greater every year.
*  And they keep exploring.
*  But I think we're also cursed with these fucking primate brains.
*  These primate brains that we have already talked about today are filled with flaws
*  and childhood trauma and bipolar and depression and schizophrenia
*  and all these different issues with the primate brain.
*  And we are the dog looking at the television screen.
*  We are.
*  And I think I've talked to a lot of these doctors that have this reductionist perspective.
*  And very few of them have had psychedelic experiences.
*  I think the brain is capable of opening up a door.
*  And I think that door opens when you die.
*  And I don't know where it goes.
*  Door is a bad word.
*  It's not the right word.
*  But it's all I have.
*  It's an opening.
*  It's a gateway.
*  There's something going on inside of us.
*  There's something going on.
*  We are interconnected in ways that are far greater than
*  our understanding of human social interactions.
*  There's something going on with us.
*  And we experience that with love.
*  We experience that with the love of your wife or your husband
*  or the love of your child or your family members.
*  We experience this connection that's like this.
*  It's very different.
*  It connects us as souls.
*  And that's what I think I'm getting to.
*  I think the soul is real.
*  And I really didn't have that thought really.
*  I was pretty atheist.
*  I grew up, I went to Catholic school when I was very young for first grade
*  and had a really bad experience there.
*  And it just was like religion's bullshit.
*  My parents were breaking up when I was young.
*  And I got really into religion because I felt like religion,
*  at least, if there's chaos in my family life, there's always God.
*  God's going to make sense.
*  Then I went to Catholic school.
*  I was like, OK, God has nothing to do with this.
*  This is fucking ridiculous.
*  Then my grandfather died.
*  I was very close to my grandfather.
*  I loved him very, very much.
*  I stayed with him when I moved to New York.
*  And I was like 23 years old.
*  And I didn't have a place to stay.
*  I didn't have any money.
*  I just got signed by this manager and I was going to go to New York to do stand-up comedy.
*  I was like, I'm going to chase my dreams.
*  So I was living with my grandfather.
*  And it was my grandmother had an aneurysm.
*  And they gave my grandmother 72 hours and she lived for 12 years.
*  At least 12 years.
*  It might have been a little longer.
*  And she was bedridden.
*  And I was staying with him and her.
*  And my grandfather had been dealing with his wife dying for all these years.
*  And she would like moan in pain.
*  You'd hear like make these sounds.
*  And I knew they were they were he was old and she was old.
*  They were dying.
*  And I knew she was going to die probably quicker than him.
*  And it was this transition in my life from
*  me like going forth on this great adventure to seeing this man that I loved.
*  It's just darkness.
*  It was like his wife.
*  My grandmother was bedridden.
*  It was agony.
*  It was depression.
*  They lived in a very bad neighborhood.
*  They lived in North 9th Street in Newark, New Jersey.
*  When they moved there in the 1940s, it was an all Italian neighborhood.
*  And then they started doing this thing called blockbusting.
*  And what blockbusting is is they would real estate agents would come in and they would
*  say black people are moving into your neighborhood.
*  You have to sell now.
*  If you don't sell now, you're going to lose the value of your home.
*  And it's the way they like they fired up the real estate market and they crushed communities this way.
*  And my grandfather was like, I like black people.
*  I'm not going anywhere.
*  And he never moved.
*  And he stayed there.
*  It changed from a black neighborhood to a primarily Hispanic neighborhood.
*  And when I was with him, when I stayed with him just before,
*  just before after I got there, I can't really remember.
*  It was 30 years ago.
*  The kid next door was selling crack and police broke down the door.
*  And he had an Audi.
*  I remember he had an Audi in the driveway.
*  I remember looking, I was like, how does a kid have a fucking Audi?
*  It's a nice car, you know, in 1990.
*  And it was just bad.
*  Everything was very depressing.
*  It was a depressing, depressing space like the neighborhood was depressing.
*  His life was ending.
*  You know, he it was very, very sad.
*  And when I went to his funeral, when he was in the casket, I looked at him.
*  I'm sure you've been to a funeral before, and I know you've seen dead people before,
*  but there's something about seeing a dead body where you're like, oh, he's not there.
*  Yeah, it's unmistakable.
*  He's not there.
*  It's not as simple as, you know, he stopped moving.
*  No, he's not there.
*  He wasn't there anymore.
*  And I remember,
*  I remember this feeling of like, understanding came across me like, oh,
*  like the thing is inside of you, whatever that is, is real.
*  It's not just as simple as you're alive.
*  Right.
*  And I, at that moment, at that moment, I see my grandfather in his casket.
*  I started considering a soul.
*  I started thinking like, oh, this isn't bullshit.
*  And then I started thinking like how arrogant it is to assume that you know
*  that all these people for thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of years
*  have talked about souls.
*  Right.
*  It's not, it's a universal idea.
*  It's not common to one specific culture.
*  It's not isolated.
*  It's a universal concept of there being something inside of you.
*  And I think it's an, I think it's something that we intuitively understand
*  that we know we are aware of it.
*  We know it's real.
*  We just can't put it on a scale.
*  We can't put a ruler on it and measure it.
*  We can't, but there's, it's a thing.
*  And I think that thing is, it's intertwined with consciousness.
*  That's what I think.
*  This is just my own feeling.
*  I think your soul interacts with consciousness and consciousness is a force.
*  And I think we're all experiencing consciousness.
*  We're just doing it in this weird way.
*  We're doing it with different biological entities, different life experiences,
*  different people and stimuli.
*  You're around different neighborhoods, different parts of the world,
*  but it's the same thing.
*  And the way I've described it is like, I think that you are me.
*  I know it sounds like it's like hippie nonsense horse shit,
*  but I think if you live my life, you would be me.
*  And if I lived your life, I would be you.
*  And I think we are all people.
*  I think all people are the same.
*  We are just living through different genetics, different biological experience,
*  different biological filters, different life experiences.
*  I think we're all the same.
*  I really do.
*  And I think that what your soul is, is your connection to consciousness.
*  I think your thing, the thing that you intersect with.
*  And I think whatever we are, there's like a place that that thing goes.
*  Right.
*  And I have a feeling that that's what these near-death experiences are.
*  That's what a lot of psychedelic experiences are.
*  I think it's a looking into the other side.
*  I don't think all these cultures have had this same idea by accident.
*  Yeah, structurally, like at their core, they're all incredibly similar.
*  And there's the realm of the dead.
*  Right.
*  And so I think there's also a very limited, there's a perspective of what God is,
*  and there's a perspective of the universe itself.
*  Like, oh, who made the universe if God didn't make the universe?
*  Or who made God?
*  I think we are limited by our own biological perspective,
*  which requires a birth and a death, a beginning and an end.
*  And that there has to, it has to come from somewhere.
*  And I don't necessarily think that's real.
*  And I have a feeling that this concept of a God is even greater.
*  What it entails is even greater than an entity.
*  I think it's all things.
*  I think what God really is, is the universe.
*  I think it is all things.
*  Right.
*  Well, that's, biocentrism is sort of along those lines.
*  It's all one huge thing.
*  Yeah, I've come to this thought, like, in steps over time,
*  like where it makes more and more sense.
*  I'm not trying to comfort myself.
*  I'm not looking for some sort of rational, that's not what I'm doing.
*  I feel like all these cultures have this idea for a reason.
*  Right.
*  I think we're tuning into it in these little blips,
*  and we're bringing back evidence from the other side.
*  We're bringing back stories and anecdotes and feelings that you get, intuition,
*  things that happen at certain times in your life where you're just like,
*  okay, what is that?
*  What is that?
*  You're, I think we all know also that if you have love in your life,
*  and you love your friends, and you have good times,
*  like there's an elevated feeling that comes with that, that's bigger than just fun.
*  There's like, there's a bond that we have,
*  because it's the moment in these great times of love where we recognize that we're one.
*  That's right.
*  You lose the shackles of your individuality.
*  You lose your ego.
*  You lose your biological limitations.
*  The bio, this chimp body and chimp mind that wants to keep you alive,
*  that wants to make sure you spread your genes and control resources
*  and do all the stupid things that humans do.
*  That thing confuses you that that's what life is.
*  Right.
*  There's a cemetery, a veteran cemetery in the woods near,
*  in the town where my mom used to live.
*  My mom passed away, obviously.
*  I'd go running there, and it's a beautiful little spot.
*  So hidden away, and there's a gravestone of a World War II vet who died later in life.
*  Right. He lived a natural life and died in his 80s.
*  And it's a very simple gravestone.
*  I can't remember his name.
*  I wrote it down.
*  And all it says is, all that survives of us is love.
*  That's so beautiful.
*  And I think that's right.
*  And you don't need to be religious to think that way.
*  You don't have to, you can be whatever.
*  It's just like such a profound truth.
*  That's all that survives.
*  Yeah. And I think a lot of religions are simply people's effort to try to consolidate all these
*  thoughts and feelings into a doctrine, into something that you can tell people that you
*  have the answer.
*  And whenever someone tells you they have the answer, well, that's impossible.
*  That's impossible, so you don't have the answer.
*  But there might be wisdom in these ancient teachings that I think is real.
*  And I think that's really what fascinates me about religion.
*  It's ancient man's attempts to understand and define this whole thing with this monkey
*  mind that we have.
*  Right. Right.
*  Sometimes people ask me, so how did this change you?
*  You know, did you find God?
*  You know, no, I didn't.
*  But, you know, it did change me.
*  And one of the ways it changed me in is that I realized even if you're in good health,
*  even if you're not in a war zone, blah, blah, blah, that we don't know, none of us know
*  that this is not our last day.
*  Right.
*  Right? None of us know.
*  I mean, probably not, hopefully not.
*  But we don't know for sure.
*  June 16th, 2020 was an utterly ordinary day when I woke up that morning.
*  I had no idea.
*  I was really slated to die in 12 hours.
*  Right? No clue.
*  And so if you somehow knew that you were going to die in 12 hours, somehow knew that,
*  who would you want to be that day?
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  I'm guessing you wouldn't be scrolling through Instagram.
*  I'm guessing you wouldn't be wasting your time hating on people that pissed you off.
*  I'm guessing you'd be just holding your loved ones close and just being amazed at how beautiful
*  a tree is.
*  Or I don't know what.
*  Right?
*  Like it's almost a religious vision of what existence is.
*  Right?
*  I think it would inspire that.
*  And so, so my question is, like, you don't know that today isn't your last day.
*  Who do you want to be today?
*  Right?
*  Because you never know.
*  So who do you want to be in the world?
*  And hopefully day after day, you're that person and then you don't have to die at the end.
*  Like what a beautiful way to live.
*  And that's sort of changed me in that sense.
*  I saw after I finished the book, I read a story about Dostoevsky, the great Russian writer,
*  who suffered a mock execution when he was in his 20s.
*  I mean, what a sadistic thing to do to a young person or anybody.
*  Right?
*  So he was a radical, you know, like he and his sort of like radical friends would sit
*  around talking about outrageous stuff like liberating the serfs and crazy ideas like that.
*  And this is in the 1840s.
*  And so Tsar Nicholas I, you know, didn't take that kind of thing kindly.
*  And the police arrested them all, like six of them, threw them in jail.
*  Wasn't a particularly serious crime.
*  Right?
*  But threw them in jail.
*  It's Tsarist Russia.
*  Right?
*  It's an oppressor state.
*  Right?
*  And after eight months, they finally released them.
*  And these young men assumed that they were going to be like put in a wagon and driven
*  to the courthouse and discharged and returned to their families after eight horrible months.
*  Right?
*  Like, okay, they're put in a wagon and they're driven to a city square.
*  They only had minutes to adjust to this.
*  Instead of being released, they were tied to posts.
*  And a firing squad was lined up in front of them.
*  And the order was given to the soldiers to charge your rifles.
*  Ready.
*  Aim.
*  And at that moment, a rider galloped into the square and said the Tsar forgives them.
*  Okay?
*  So what, so the, you know, the question, my question would be like, what does the world
*  look like?
*  Like, how hallucinatory is it if you know that you're going to be dead in seconds?
*  What does the world literally look like to you, to that perspective?
*  Because we're all Dostoevsky, right?
*  I mean, the command of fire isn't maybe in three, five seconds.
*  It might be in 50 years, but we're all waiting for the, right?
*  We're all getting the command eventually.
*  So what does the world look like to someone where all of that, that whole lifetime is
*  compressed into a few seconds?
*  What's the world look like?
*  We should understand that vision of the world and incorporate it to some degree into our
*  experience of our hopefully 50, 80, 90 years of life, right?
*  So this intense little capsule of reality, like, what is, what is, so what did he, what
*  did he see in those moments?
*  Because he wrote about it.
*  Like, this is valuable information.
*  Like, what's the world look like?
*  What's it really look like when you're about to be torn from it, right?
*  And so he said he was standing there and he saw sunlight glinting off the steeple of a
*  church.
*  And he had this amazing thought, which goes to your point, right?
*  This amazing thought.
*  He said, in moments, I'm going to join the sunlight.
*  I'm going to be part of all things.
*  We're all part of all things.
*  And in minutes, that's where, that's what I'll be.
*  And then he said, if I should, some in his mind, he thought if I should, by
*  some miracle, survive this, I'm going to live my life turning every moment into an
*  infinity.
*  Wow.
*  Mind blowing, right?
*  So two of the six men in that group, it broke them.
*  They were insane for the rest of their lives.
*  Dostoevsky, he survived it psychologically and it deepened him enormously.
*  And he wrote through other characters, he wrote about that experience.
*  Yeah.
*  If you have knowledge of your death, you know, I used to do this bit about, there was a
*  tiger attack in San Francisco in like, I guess it was like the early 2000s or something.
*  These kids were throwing pine cones at a tiger in an enclosure in the zoo.
*  And they didn't know that the tiger, when they built the zoo, they made the fence 14
*  feet high.
*  They thought that was enough.
*  It's not enough.
*  I know what's coming.
*  Like you have a, the joke was if you have a monster in a box in the middle of the city,
*  maybe you should put a roof on the box.
*  Like how expensive is it to put a cage on the top?
*  Well, these kids are throwing things at the tiger.
*  The tiger leaps, leaps up, gets a hold of the top of the fence.
*  And the thought was like, if you're that kid and you see those paws hit that fence
*  and you see that thing like flying through the air, coming right at you.
*  Do you even see it or is it just like this kaleidoscope of psychedelic images?
*  You know, it's over.
*  Like you're looking at the most beautiful death that's currently available.
*  It's the most beautiful animal that can kill you, a tiger.
*  I mean, they're gorgeous and they're also terrifying at the same time.
*  And it's running at you like a psychedelic experience.
*  Wow.
*  Did they die?
*  Yeah.
*  One guy lived, I think.
*  I think one guy lived.
*  I think unfortunately the kid is throwing the pine cones lived.
*  I don't remember.
*  I don't really remember the whole story.
*  One died, two survived.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Two survived.
*  And they had to kill the tiger.
*  Of course.
*  They always have to kill the tiger because it went tiger.
*  Yeah.
*  Did what it's, I mean, look, I fucking hate zoos.
*  I mean, I used to take my kids to them because my kids loved them,
*  but they're fucking prisons.
*  They're prisons for animals that didn't do anything wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  And last time we went, we were in, I think it was in Denver,
*  and we were turning towards this primate section
*  where they have all these monkeys in these cages.
*  And this monkey is wailing, just screaming in agony, just,
*  wah, like a crazy person locked up in a cage.
*  I'm like, that poor motherfucker.
*  Like, what are they doing to him?
*  Just so people could stare at it and go, oh, there it is.
*  Oh, there it is.
*  And-
*  Yeah, it's awful.
*  Tigers are nature's balancing system.
*  You can't have too many deer, so you have to have tigers.
*  Right.
*  And axis deer are the kind of deer that live around tigers.
*  I don't know if you've ever seen an axis deer.
*  They're beautiful.
*  They have white spots over their body and they move like bullets.
*  Yeah.
*  You've never seen an animal move that fast.
*  Axis deer, they just fucking go.
*  Because they're just always looking out for tigers.
*  So this animal is primed by nature to be chasing things and killing things.
*  That is literally its biological reward system.
*  That's what it's here for.
*  That's why it's 600 pounds of fucking tissue and talons.
*  And what we do, we give it cold meat.
*  They push out on a platter and it just eats the meat.
*  It doesn't get to kill anything.
*  And then things stare at it and look at it in the eyes, which is fucking insane.
*  You ever look a tiger in the eye, in the wild you would be fucking frozen in fear.
*  And this thing has to endure other puny little things throwing stuff at it over its fence.
*  And this universal karmic moment, it realizes that it can get them.
*  Right.
*  There's an amazing poem by Ted Hughes called Wolf Watching.
*  Wolves are of course equivalent to tigers, right?
*  The canine equivalent to tigers.
*  And he goes to the zoo and looks at the wolf.
*  And the poem Wolf Watching is worth looking up.
*  It's just one of the most extraordinary poems about exactly what you're talking about.
*  And the look in the wolf's eye and what he knows you're doing to him.
*  And he's superior to you.
*  And he knows it's an unbelievable poem.
*  Ted Hughes, Wolf Watching.
*  You got to seriously look it up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, we're bizarre.
*  We're bizarre with this whole fucking zoo thing.
*  The zoo thing's very weird.
*  On one hand, it helps preserve diminishing populations of some animals.
*  You know, and they do do that.
*  But on the other hand, like, why do you have a polar bear in a fucking swimming pool
*  in the middle of night?
*  What are you doing?
*  They go crazy.
*  They just go in circles.
*  Yeah, bears in an enclosure where they just wander around in circles.
*  People go crazy too.
*  A solitary confinement.
*  People can't take it.
*  It breaks their brain.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You keep saying like the word like I'm an atheist.
*  Do I believe in God?
*  Why even have a belief?
*  I mean, I don't.
*  I don't have any belief.
*  You don't have anything anymore.
*  But you still consider yourself an atheist?
*  An atheist is someone who doesn't believe in a God.
*  Right.
*  I don't have that belief.
*  So you don't believe or not believe?
*  I mean, not believing isn't an active right.
*  Well, you don't know, right?
*  This is why the atheism thing usually kind of drives me nuts with people.
*  Like when people say there is no God, like.
*  Well, that's not atheism, right?
*  Atheism is that I don't believe in God.
*  It's not claiming to be able to prove there is.
*  Right.
*  There's a little more arrogance to there is no God.
*  I don't know whether I don't believe in a God.
*  And you can't make yourself believe in something.
*  Right.
*  So if you want to tell me that gravity doesn't exist,
*  I can't make myself believe that.
*  Right.
*  And I can't make myself believe God exists.
*  Contrary, you know, despite the complete lack of evidence that he does or she does, whatever.
*  Like, I can't force that belief in myself, even if I wanted to.
*  But I would never ever say, oh, there is no God.
*  Yeah.
*  I would never assert that.
*  Right.
*  And I wouldn't even say I'm agnostic.
*  Like, I don't know one way or the other.
*  I wouldn't even say that.
*  I would say I don't believe in God.
*  I don't run my life according to a belief in God.
*  Jordan Peterson says, whether or not you believe in God,
*  if you live your life as if God is real, you'll live a better life.
*  Well, yeah.
*  I'm paraphrasing.
*  Right.
*  That's essentially what he's saying.
*  Well, he's exhorting people towards moral behavior, which is totally fine.
*  But you don't need God to be a...
*  Look.
*  You don't need God.
*  Well, yeah, some people might.
*  And some people need laws to not rob banks.
*  I think the concept of it, that we're all connected in some way that's greater than
*  just this life experience, is what...
*  That's the foundation of this understanding of it.
*  So then what I would say is, because as soon as you say God,
*  it presents some logical problems.
*  I would say, live your life as if you believe in a universal unity, a colossal unity.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Of all things.
*  I think the word God is the problem.
*  It's just been kind of co-opted.
*  And it gets co-opted by visuals of a person, a patriarchal leader who's in the sky with a
*  fucking book of all the shit you did wrong.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And that's a silly...
*  So a guy raised his hand at one talk, and he was quite incensed,
*  and that I was still said I was an atheist.
*  Right?
*  And he said, you know, he came right at me, right?
*  And atheists don't...
*  I mean, I don't care if someone's a believer.
*  Why would I care?
*  But often, believers are quite upset that you're an atheist, which is this bizarre
*  quirk of the psychology that I don't understand.
*  But anyway, he raised his hand and he said, you're only alive because of God's grace.
*  And you have to be thankful.
*  You have to find Jesus, and you have to be thankful to God for saving you because it
*  was only his grace that saved you.
*  And I said, you know what?
*  I flatlined, right?
*  I did like what I do with upset people.
*  Like I didn't get emotional.
*  I went to zero, you know, zero Kelvin.
*  I said, you know what?
*  My problem with that is why me?
*  Like why me and not Tim?
*  Tim Hetherington was my buddy out at Ristrepo, the guy I made the movie Ristrepo with,
*  who was killed in combat in Libya.
*  He died like I did.
*  He bled out, except he bled out not from an aneurysm, but from a shrapnel wound in his
*  groin, right?
*  So why me and not Tim, right?
*  And for that matter, why me and not a nine-year-old with cancer?
*  Like, and what you're saying, so what you're saying is unless you can answer that question,
*  which I don't think you can, what you're saying is that there's actually a kind of random
*  lottery for God's grace.
*  And if that's the way he runs things, I don't want anything to do with him because that's
*  cruel, right?
*  And so that's my quibble with the word God.
*  But universal unity, you know, I'm good, right?
*  Schrodinger is good for Schrodinger, it's good for me, you know, whatever.
*  And so, you know, I would, I don't know, the violence of the emotions around all this is
*  puzzling to me.
*  Like, I don't understand why people get so heated about what someone else believes.
*  Well, people get heated about everything.
*  I've had conversations with people that are just Democrats to the end.
*  That's my team.
*  I'm with the Raiders, you know, and that's just how it is with everything.
*  And people are that way with religion.
*  They're that way with the state they live in, the football team they support.
*  They're that way with everything.
*  That's just humans.
*  It's just some primate shit.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think the real discussion is in how do you feel, why do you feel the way you feel
*  and what do you think and what do you know that has sort of educated these thoughts?
*  And, you know, if you believe that human beings are inherently bad and that only a fear of
*  hell, and frankly, not a love of God, a fear of God will make you act well.
*  If you really think that's what humans are, then sort of religion makes sense.
*  But so for me, for example, and I'm assuming for you and most people that I think we probably
*  know, like, I don't murder people and rob banks and things like that because I'm afraid
*  of going to jail.
*  I refrain from doing those things because I don't want to be someone who does those things.
*  I have my own inner morality about what it means to be a good person, to not be a freaking
*  psychopath.
*  Like, I mean, I don't want to go to jail either, but you don't need the laws.
*  You don't need the courts to make me act well in that sense.
*  So if you need God in order to, like, not rob banks and kill people and rape people,
*  bro, you got a freaking problem.
*  Right.
*  Right?
*  You're still a problem even if you don't do those things because you're scared of God.
*  You're still not a person that I trust.
*  Yeah, no, I share that perspective.
*  I think what this whole thing is for a lot of people and one of the problems with religion
*  and true believers is, boy, folks, there's a lot of different versions of that story.
*  And you got to make sure you're betting on the right one because there's a billion people
*  that don't think you are.
*  And you think you're smarter than them?
*  Like, I think it's people trying to get a map of what this is all about.
*  Right.
*  And I think it's been that way forever.
*  I think people have always tried to figure it out and they have little bits and pieces
*  and we're putting it together.
*  And unfortunately, we also like to look at these things as if they're like this doctrine
*  is 100% factual.
*  I've seen Muslims do it.
*  I've seen Christians do it.
*  I've seen Jews do it.
*  People have this belief that their way is the way.
*  It's the only way.
*  Everyone else is the other, which seems contrary to the Word of God, the real thought, the
*  concept of this interconnected thing that we're experiencing.
*  I think it's all way weirder.
*  I think everyone's scared to die, but no one's scared to sleep because you know you're going
*  to come back.
*  But you do it every night.
*  Every night you go to some crazy place.
*  You shut off and you return and you assume because you have memory and because you have
*  an understanding of the environment and you have a task that you have to do.
*  Oh, I've got to be at work by 9.
*  You have all this stuff in your head.
*  You're assuming, just assuming that as you woke up today that this is your life at 56
*  years old, continuing along the same path, but it might not be.
*  It's just guessing.
*  Our eyes closed and we're feeling through the darkness and we don't know.
*  And we give ourselves these rules and we give ourselves these stories.
*  We give ourselves these religious practices to put structure into this thing and to put
*  certainty into this thing that is absolutely uncertain.
*  And we get angry if someone questions our certainty because our certainty defines our
*  ability to exist in this experience in a way that keeps us sane.
*  God has a will.
*  God has a plan.
*  This is all.
*  I think it's way weirder.
*  I think it's way weirder and I think that's what you experience when your dad came to you.
*  And that's what you experience when you look down at the pit.
*  I think the whole thing is way weirder.
*  I don't think it's as simple as why would God take a child and give it to you.
*  I think the whole thing is an uber complex interaction of emotions and experiences that
*  we're all going through simultaneously.
*  And I have a feeling that part of the thing that moves us forward, unfortunately,
*  is negativity and the positivity battling against that negativity,
*  it strengthens the positivity because of the resistance.
*  I think like the evil of the world is almost like an important factor in the whole equation
*  of our existence.
*  Yeah, and I think humans have always struggled with it and they've come up with theories that
*  sort of like help them get by and some of them even support human dignity, some don't.
*  And here we are with the great, you know, still surrounded by the great mystery.
*  The great mystery.
*  And you know what?
*  Like, let's hear it for the great mystery.
*  Like, if you think about it, this thought came to me the other day, like we're in a kind of sweet spot.
*  We're in a kind of sweet spot.
*  So if you sort of knew for sure, like we could, if the scientists could prove, right,
*  the nerds could prove that there was an afterlife and what you got to do was just more of the same,
*  except it's a lot more pleasant for eternity.
*  If we could prove that, it would strip the value out of these precious decades that we are allotted.
*  One of the reasons that life is so precious is because it's so finite.
*  Right?
*  So if you could prove there was an afterlife, don't worry about it.
*  Like, you're going to, you know, okay, you know, your wife dumped you and blah, blah, blah.
*  But, you know, don't worry about it because soon the afterlife is going to start and then you're
*  good forever.
*  So just don't sweat it.
*  Right?
*  In fact, why don't you just kill yourself right now and just get onto it?
*  Because that's when the good part starts, right?
*  It would ruin what life is.
*  It would strip it of value.
*  On the other hand, like the two other guys in Dostoevsky's group of friends,
*  if we could prove, like literally prove scientifically that there is no afterlife,
*  and you can't prove a negative, but somehow if we could prove there was no afterlife
*  whatsoever, we're biological beings.
*  When we die, that's it.
*  We rot.
*  We return to the soil.
*  That's it.
*  Done.
*  If we could prove that, that might be so psychologically devastating that it would be
*  actually quite hard to lead a meaningful life because in your mind you're thinking, well,
*  what's the frigging point?
*  Right.
*  Right?
*  So where we're at right now, there's the perfect level of ambiguity that there's not such a proof
*  of afterlife that, you know, why bother leading our lives, but there's also not such a doubt
*  about it that it's psychologically devastating.
*  We're in this sweet spot, which allows us to sort of invest maximum meaning in the least
*  amount of psychological distress in these decades that we're allotted.
*  So in a weird way, where we're at right now is to sort of tune perfectly to the human brain
*  for giving the maximum amount of meaning to this time that we have here on Earth.
*  And if you go in the extreme of either direction of absolute certainty that there is an afterlife
*  or is no afterlife, if you go to that extreme, it actually just robs us of what we do know
*  for sure that we have, which is this life right now.
*  Right.
*  And that's part of the magic of it, right?
*  The magic of it is the uncertainty, the temporary nature of it, the finite nature of existence,
*  all of it.
*  Yeah.
*  And the reason, you know, Karl Marx hated religion is because basically the peasant
*  class had been told, listen, don't worry about it.
*  Your lot sucks, right?
*  The serfs, like your lot sucks, you were oppressed, you're poor, blah, blah, blah.
*  But don't worry about it because there's an afterlife.
*  So, and Marx was like, there'll never be revolution as long as people think that once they die,
*  everything gets nice.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And so that's why Marx hated religion.
*  And it's a totally legitimate point.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a legitimate point, but you think, you know, even that is like,
*  there's too much we don't know, and it's too hard to not know things.
*  So we pretend.
*  Right.
*  And the version of religion that he was rebelling against is like, look,
*  the meek shall inherit the earth.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  You're crushed under the boot heel of czars, the czars boot heel here in life, but, you know,
*  the meek shall inherit the earth.
*  So just wait a little while and then it's all going to come to you.
*  Like that's why, you know, Marx wasn't objecting to sort of like transcendent, not knowing,
*  transcendent mystery.
*  Right.
*  He was objecting to a completely calculated and manipulative, like,
*  social program that kept people oppressed.
*  Which is oftentimes what religion becomes, particularly when people have groups
*  of people that they control.
*  Yeah.
*  Power like Genghis Khan famously let people practice any religion they wanted.
*  People like, oh, he's so open minded.
*  No, that's not what it was.
*  He wanted order.
*  And he's like, yeah, believe that.
*  Go believe that.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  He also apparently just screwed his way across Asia because I think it's 11% of the population
*  in the areas that he conquered are directly descended from him.
*  His DNA.
*  Yeah.
*  11%.
*  He killed 10% of the population of the planet.
*  And replaced them with...
*  Well, he did.
*  I mean, in his lifetime, because of his actions, somewhere between 50 and 70 million people died.
*  It's so many that you can see when they do core samples of the Earth,
*  a difference in the carbon footprint of human beings.
*  Yeah.
*  The areas that they devastated reforested to the point where there's a difference in
*  the level of carbon.
*  Wow, that's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  That's how many people they killed.
*  There's a famous story, Dan Carlin's Hardcore History is this amazing podcast.
*  And he has this series called The Wrath of the Khan.
*  In one of the stories, they talk about the Charizmian Shah who goes to visit Jin, China.
*  And they think what they see in the distance is a snow covered peak.
*  And as they get closer, they realize that it's a mountain of bones.
*  They had killed over a million people in the city and piled them up on top of each other.
*  And they had to abandon their...
*  They were pulling wagons.
*  They had abandoned the roads because the roads were so mocked up with decaying humans
*  that the roads had become muddy.
*  You couldn't traverse them because so many people had rotted and decayed in the roads
*  that it became mud.
*  That's insane.
*  But he was really open minded when he came to religion.
*  And he opened up trade to the East.
*  Like there's a lot of like...
*  And he had a lot of wives.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I don't think they were wives.
*  They were wives.
*  Yeah, he did a lot of raping, a lot of murdering.
*  And horrible, torturous murdering.
*  And like the stories, it's just like what we know.
*  Just about how about the way they hid his burial site.
*  Do you know that story?
*  They fucking killed everybody.
*  Everybody who went and buried him, everybody who killed the people who buried them,
*  they killed them.
*  They killed thousands of people just to protect the location of his grave.
*  And to this day, nobody knows where it is.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Wild.
*  Yeah.
*  There's an amazing book by...
*  Is it Jack Weatherford?
*  I think his name is about Genghis Khan, like the classic book.
*  It's an amazing book, worth reading.
*  Jack Weatherford.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, what a...
*  It's just...
*  What a fucking bizarre moment in history where this one genius is like really the best at killing
*  people and taking over countries.
*  And he does it at a scale.
*  And then it goes away, which is a real lesson for America.
*  Because the Mongols ran everything for a long fucking time, for hundreds of years,
*  and then they didn't.
*  Because of infighting.
*  Yeah.
*  Infighting.
*  They weren't defeated from the outside.
*  It was infighting.
*  Well, also Genghis Khan was dead.
*  And the genius behind the whole operation, he had a particular tactical war mind that
*  was just different than everybody else's.
*  He was a genius.
*  Absolutely.
*  He was just a genius applied to killing people.
*  And that was gone once his children took over and how it always works.
*  That's right.
*  But that's us, folks.
*  When people...
*  When I talk to left-wing people about aggression and how it's...
*  How it's maladaptive, with the anthropological term.
*  Maladaptive produces bad outcomes.
*  Right?
*  And I'm like, look, arguably the most aggressive man on the planet in history was Genghis Khan.
*  And he left the largest genetic footprint on the human genome, on the human race,
*  of any individual ever.
*  Right?
*  So aggression at that level, in Darwinian terms, is absolutely rewarded.
*  The shy guy that was writing poetry had one kid.
*  Right?
*  Genghis Khan, 11% of the population of the area that he conquered is descended directly from him.
*  He's their daddy.
*  That was because of his aggression.
*  Right?
*  So you just...
*  You have to understand that in evolutionary terms, aggression is richly rewarded.
*  So the trick for human culture is to blunt that with some cultural values
*  that bring people back into a place of peace and dignity and cooperation and blah, blah, blah.
*  Right?
*  But just don't tell me that aggression is counterproductive.
*  Right?
*  It's complete nonsense.
*  Well, it's just...
*  It's a utopian perspective.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, aggression's bad.
*  Toxic male energy is bad.
*  Yeah, until someone's invading your fucking country.
*  Yeah.
*  And yeah, those are toxic males.
*  Yeah, I get it.
*  But guess what?
*  You need some on your side, too.
*  And that's the only way we survive.
*  That's the only way we made it to 2024.
*  I mean, listen, chimpanzees do the same thing.
*  Males will invade a rival territory and kill off individual males by ganging up on them.
*  This isn't a fair fight, right?
*  This is 10 to 1.
*  Beat the male's rival males to death from the rival troop.
*  Beat them to death.
*  And when they're shrieking in terror, their buddies in the rival troop
*  don't rush to their aid like humans would.
*  They run away.
*  That's the difference between chimpanzees and humans.
*  Is the male, what's called the male coalition exists in chimpanzee society,
*  but they don't run to the aid of their brothers if they're, you know,
*  when the chips are down, they save themselves individually.
*  Humans don't do that.
*  We will rush to help.
*  We will rush to help a brother who's in danger, as it were, right?
*  Like even at risk to our own lives, it's one of the few unique traits that humans have
*  that other mammals don't.
*  Which is probably how we made it.
*  Exactly.
*  Because we're better off in a group.
*  Even a group in a desperate situation.
*  But chimpanzees, the rival troop that's getting beaten to death one by one,
*  eventually they're wiped out because they don't form a coalition to defend, only to attack.
*  They'll form a coalition to attack, but not to defend, right?
*  So what happens is the more aggressive troop of chimpanzees
*  wipes out the males of the rival troop one by one.
*  The rivals won't form a coalition to defend.
*  And then they take over the territory, all the food resources of that territory,
*  and the females.
*  And now the aggressive troop of chimpanzees is now bigger and stronger,
*  and those genes will be passed on at a higher rate than the genes
*  of the poor bastards who got beaten to death one by one.
*  That's how Darwinism works, and that's why aggression exists in the world.
*  There's a genetic reward for it.
*  That's why we're here.
*  And that's why we're here.
*  This is all God's plan.
*  And then human culture, that's right, that's right, it's all God's plan.
*  And human culture came up with this extraordinary thing, it's like, you know what, guys?
*  We're all in one thing.
*  We're this tribe, we're that tribe.
*  We have to fight to the last man to defend each other and defend our families, blah, blah, blah.
*  Because otherwise we're not going to make it because the fucking Vikings are coming over the ridge.
*  Right?
*  So who's with me?
*  Braveheart.
*  Whatever.
*  Endless stories about that kind of heroism, like we're all together,
*  we'll die together if we have to, but we are all together, right?
*  And that's a uniquely human trait.
*  Yeah, it certainly is.
*  And the problem is when you have a utopian perspective and you want everyone,
*  like, I'm not dangerous, I want the world to not be dangerous.
*  The problem is the world is dangerous, and it's genetically dangerous.
*  It's like it's always been dangerous.
*  It's just this is what it is.
*  And I think we're in this enormous process.
*  It's certainly much better to live today, at least it is here,
*  than it would be during the time of Dostoevsky.
*  If you live back then, it's less information, it's more dangerous,
*  people have more control of people, they're crueler.
*  It's more common.
*  Things get better over time, but it's a slow, slow process.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And we're in the middle of it.
*  And we look back and we say, oh, those fools.
*  But in the future, they're going to look back at us and say the same goddamn thing.
*  The same way we look at Genghis Khan, they're going to look at us.
*  What the fuck did they do in Ukraine?
*  What the fuck did Israel do in Gaza?
*  What the fuck is going on in Sudan?
*  What the fuck is going on in wherever?
*  Fill in the blank.
*  Anywhere in the world.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And there is some hope, like, sort of global alliances blunt some of this stuff.
*  So there is a sort of cultural evolution from the ancestral origins of the species.
*  Alliances do often stabilize things, which is great.
*  I mean, that's a good thing.
*  But again, alliances can also precipitate conflicts.
*  So whatever.
*  Yeah, it's a complex mixture of things happening.
*  And I think, again, not to get too, like, woo-woo spiritual, but I think that's a part of our journey.
*  A part of our journey is navigating the good and evil.
*  Right.
*  That these are real forces.
*  That's right.
*  I will be killed publicly executed, like Dostoevsky almost was, by my publisher if I don't say the name of my book.
*  I know you don't want that to happen.
*  I definitely don't want you to get killed, especially after what you've been through.
*  In my time of dying, how I came face to face with the idea of an afterlife.
*  All right, man.
*  Well, listen, brother, it's always great to see you.
*  I'm glad you're alive.
*  Thank you.
*  I really enjoy these conversations we've had.
*  Me too, man.
*  Me too.
*  They're really wonderful.
*  Thanks for having me on and having such a great long talk about all this stuff.
*  My pleasure.
*  Did you read the audiobook?
*  I did.
*  Yes.
*  Good.
*  Beautiful.
*  You got to listen to it on the treadmill.
*  Yes, I will do that.
*  Thank you very much, man.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  Appreciate you.
*  My pleasure.
*  All right.
*  Bye, everybody.
