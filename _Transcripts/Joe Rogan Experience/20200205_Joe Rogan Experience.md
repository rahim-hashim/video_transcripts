# Joe Rogan Experience #1423 - Andrew Doyle
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIxhH85cQMY)
*  3, 2, 1. This is your unveiling.
*  Because now people know.
*  People know, yep, that's it.
*  First of all, Titiana.
*  So this is, I should have chosen an easier name.
*  Like no one can get it, it's Titania.
*  Titania.
*  Because she's named after the Queen of the Fairies in Midsummer Night's Dream.
*  Tell everybody your real name.
*  My real name's Andrew Doyle.
*  Do you have an issue with people now knowing that Titiana or Titania?
*  Titania?
*  Yeah, she totally eclipsed me.
*  I'm basically not alive anymore.
*  It's all about her.
*  Well, I can't remember how I found out about you on Twitter,
*  but just laughing really hard at something that you wrote that was so close.
*  You do such a good job of blurring the line between outrageously woke and satire.
*  Yeah, it's that thing of trying to...
*  There you are.
*  Who's the girl?
*  Oh, there, okay.
*  So the girl is a composite of four different women put together
*  because I was worried about, you know, I don't want to get sued or anything like that.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Yeah, so it's not a real human.
*  Radical intersectionalist poet.
*  Selfless and brave, buy my book.
*  Activist healer.
*  But also I love that she's deadpan because it means that she sort of...
*  Look, every time I post something, it's like there's this po-faced woman staring at you, daring you.
*  Yes.
*  Don't you dare sort of challenge me.
*  She could be mean in a way that I'm not.
*  So that's kind of funny you end up inhabiting this character who just isn't like you.
*  And I do end up thinking like her.
*  And I've even dreamt as her, and that sounds like a lie, but I have.
*  Wow.
*  So that's pretty scary.
*  She'll have to go eventually because I can't deal with that kind of...
*  There's a psychosis, isn't there?
*  Well, she's so big now.
*  You have 420,000 followers.
*  It's weird because it happened really quickly.
*  I guess it's because there's a whole cohort of people out there who are just sick of this stuff.
*  Oh, yes.
*  Well, it's partly that, but also partly because people still fall for her all the time.
*  People constantly think it's real.
*  Oh, all the time.
*  When I retweet you, one of my favorite things to do is read people getting upset at you.
*  They're like, that is ridiculous.
*  You think that?
*  That's why Trump was winning.
*  Right.
*  Never ceases to amaze me how angry people get on Twitter with even legitimate causes.
*  But I watch that and I think it's fun because I can satirize the left and the more liberal side of things through her.
*  But then I can argue with the right-wing Trump supporters and stuff, and I can mock them as well.
*  So you get to have a go at the extremes.
*  Yes.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I'm so shocked that people still think she's real, though, even after all this time.
*  It's not shocking.
*  You're close enough.
*  There's plenty of people, and I'll point you to a few of them that I follow.
*  I follow some people where I just bookmark them so they don't know that I follow them.
*  And just some of them are so goddamn fucking crazy.
*  And yet I keep getting told this is like a straw man.
*  These people don't really exist.
*  Oh, they exist.
*  I even once did a tweet by, is it Rosanna Arquette who's really, really woke?
*  I think so.
*  She did a tweet about how ashamed she was of being white.
*  Is that her?
*  That was her.
*  I think it was her.
*  And then I just cut and paste that tweet and put it out.
*  Patricia Arquette.
*  It might have been.
*  It's one of the Arquettes.
*  But I did the same tweet.
*  I literally cut and pasted it as Tatani because I thought like, and some people got it that
*  I'd just taken this other viral tweet, and some people got the point I was making.
*  But yeah, it's close to, some of them are nuts.
*  Like, frighteningly so, to a point that it's a cult-like behavior.
*  I think the basic principles of standing up against racism, sexism, homophobia, all that
*  stuff is great.
*  Yes.
*  I think the woke movement isn't that.
*  It's a kind of weird cultish, pseudo-religious thing that is beyond that.
*  So that you're no longer allowed to make mistakes.
*  You can't be redeemed.
*  There's no, it's got all those hallmarks.
*  Yes.
*  It's like when the early Christians used to burn people out of love.
*  It's that thing.
*  I think that's why we get this kind of council culture stuff.
*  And I guess that's why I want to, maybe that's why it's popular.
*  Because people are sick of treading around on eggshells, worried about being misinterpreted
*  or even worried about fucking up and making a mistake.
*  I mean, what's wrong with saying something that's every now and then maybe you do say
*  the wrong thing?
*  Well, it should be fine if you're a human being.
*  But part of it is also that things are written down, right?
*  Right.
*  And then when things are written down, you can see them over and over again.
*  If you made a mistake and just said something in normal human conversation, which is how
*  we're supposed to communicate and how we normally communicate, it just comes and goes.
*  Yeah.
*  But when it's written down, then it becomes something different.
*  But it's more than that, isn't it?
*  Because I'll give you an example.
*  So there was a guy who was the editor of a cookery magazine in the UK.
*  And a vegan freelance journalist emailed him saying, I'd love to do a thing about vegans.
*  And he replied and made some joke about, yeah, you can do something about how we'll force
*  feed the meat and we'll make them eat each other and all stupid flippant thing.
*  Right.
*  So rather than saying, I was really offended by that.
*  Can we talk about it?
*  I don't think that's appropriate for you to email a freelance journalist.
*  She screenshot the thing, put it on Twitter, made a thing of it, and he had to step down.
*  So I think that's the difference is whereas like saying to someone, look, calling out
*  a mistake or calling someone out for something they've done that you perceive to be bad,
*  that's all well and good.
*  But when you're using it to advertise how virtuous you are and how you're able to take
*  someone down for the mistake that they made, that troubles me.
*  Because then it's no longer about really about the issue.
*  Well, I think what we're dealing with when you're talking about woke culture, and I love
*  that you made this comparison to radical religion, because I think they're the same patterns.
*  I think human beings have patterns that they follow and you could say that you're not
*  religious, but you follow these extremely rigid ideologies that don't allow for any
*  variation whatsoever.
*  They force 100% compliance, and if you're not 100% in compliant, they will attack you
*  and you can't be woke enough.
*  One of the things you find in religion is people will, especially in the more radical,
*  dangerous, and scary religions, they'll turn on each other.
*  They'll turn on each other for not being pious enough.
*  Yeah, all the time.
*  Yeah, that happens in woke culture.
*  One of the scariest things that happens to these woke people is when the woke people
*  attack them.
*  Oh yeah, and when it happened with J.K. Rowling.
*  Yes.
*  Didn't it happen with J.K. Rowling because she defended, it was a British case, it was
*  the woman who was fired from her job because she posted some tweets saying that she didn't
*  believe that sex was a mutable characteristic.
*  She said, there are men and women and you can't change it.
*  Now, that's her opinion and she's entitled to have it, but the judge in the UK ruled
*  that no, that's not a legitimate opinion to hold and you can be fired for that.
*  Right?
*  So J.K. Rowling simply said, no, that's not fair.
*  That's her opinion.
*  And they went for her.
*  Yeah.
*  Even though she's like, she's so woke because she keeps retrospectively deciding that her
*  characters are gay and all sorts of stuff like that.
*  Yes.
*  Dumbledore's gay.
*  Yes.
*  And she got...
*  They got after her.
*  They went after her before that as well because in the Fantastic Beasts sequel with Dumbledore
*  as a young man, there's not much overt homosexuality.
*  And so the LGBTQ community was saying, why isn't it more, I mean, what do they want?
*  Like double penetration.
*  What do they want with that?
*  Like they want a full on wizard gay sex scene and she got the brunt of that.
*  You know, it's like this doesn't... and I hate that sort of...
*  I don't think you don't need validation by seeing wizards making out.
*  Well, unless that's your vision.
*  I mean, if her vision was, I mean, if she wanted some radical sexual aspect to her story...
*  I don't think it was.
*  But if she wanted it, no, it wasn't.
*  Yeah, if she wants to write wizard porn, that's fine.
*  I mean, if that's...
*  Look, I mean, it doesn't even necessarily have to be porn, but I don't think you should
*  ever try to alter someone's artistic vision when someone is a genius like J.K. Rowling.
*  I mean, think about the stuff that she's created.
*  Look, the Harry Potter series speaks for itself just in the sheer popularity of it.
*  For someone to step in and say you're doing it wrong when it comes to gay sex, everything else is great.
*  Or any...
*  You're a fucking genius with everything but gay sex.
*  Also, I don't like... it's not her responsibility to be the ambassador for gay sex.
*  And also, you know, I think it's really patronising to gay people to say that they need to see this.
*  Yeah.
*  But that is now like a standard thing in art and movies and stuff.
*  So, like, you saw that with Tarantino with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.
*  Someone asked him, a journalist was saying, you know, like, why doesn't the female character,
*  why doesn't Margot Robbie's character talk more?
*  Well, he's made an artistic decision.
*  He hasn't thought, let's just... the female character, I don't care about that character,
*  so let's have her silent most of the time.
*  She's making a point about sort of restoring Sharon Tate to an iconic kind of status that she was denied by the Manson family.
*  It's a very interesting artistic decision.
*  And if you watch a film like that and you go away and all you can think is, oh, the women didn't speak enough,
*  there wasn't enough diversity, then you're not engaging with the artwork, you know?
*  Right.
*  Like, we had it in the BBC, did a review of Game of Thrones by series by series,
*  where they judged each episode as good or bad on the percentage points of how much female characters speak.
*  So, don't do reviews anymore.
*  They just have a pie chart.
*  It's weird to me.
*  It's almost a complete misunderstanding of what the creative endeavour is all about.
*  Sure. I mean, look, did Thelma and Louise do a disservice by not having Brad Pitt talk more?
*  Well, exactly. That's a good example. Yeah.
*  Come on, it's crazy. No, it was a great movie because it was a great movie.
*  It's just an artistic vision doesn't have to adhere to these ideas of inclusiveness and diversity.
*  It just doesn't. An artistic vision is supposed to...
*  If you write about a bunch of Asian kids that want to be hip-hop artists,
*  you have no obligation to have white people in it. Right.
*  You have no obligation to have anyone else in it.
*  You could have, look, you could have a movie with one character through the whole movie.
*  You have no obligation. Of course.
*  It's an artistic vision.
*  But I've been thinking about this a lot because I think this gets to the heart of what is the problem with the woke culture
*  and what the foundation of their belief system is.
*  And it's to do with this idea of, what do you hear it all the time? Power structures in society.
*  That there's this kind of...
*  And that's why they think there needs to be more representation and things like that in these films
*  because they think that influences culture and influences people and maintains and sustains power and everything like that.
*  So that's why they're doing it. And I think it's just a false premise, ultimately.
*  It is a false premise. And the people that are doing it and the people that are perpetuating this false premise
*  are not doing good work. That's another part of the problem.
*  If you want to be a woke artist, good fucking luck. Good fucking luck.
*  Because your stuff's probably going to suck because you're thinking about that
*  more than you're thinking about the singular artistic vision that you might have.
*  You're trying to put it through the filter of intersectionality and all these different variables
*  that you have to take into consideration of how you're going to be criticized and what you're going to...
*  As soon as you compromise yourself, in any end... you open up the door for mediocrity.
*  And it doesn't sell well. And I think that's simply because people hate being patronized.
*  Yeah, it's like the... was that expression, go get woke, go broke?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Exactly.
*  I mean, when I saw that last Star Wars film and you got the lesbian kiss, like a two second of lesbian kiss,
*  and I know what they're doing. And I don't care about that sort of stuff.
*  By all means, make a full lesbian Star Wars film. I don't care about that.
*  But you feel hectored. You feel like someone's standing over your shoulder saying,
*  you see, that is what you're supposed to support. You're all homophobes.
*  But that's good. That's what they're basically saying.
*  They're saying you're all bad people. They don't trust human beings. They don't trust society.
*  And they're rabid. They're rabid about their need for compliance. Everyone must comply.
*  There's a crazy one that I... I'll send it to you, Jamie, because I was sending it to a bunch of people
*  about them calling for Captain Marvel to step down.
*  Right. Okay. Why?
*  Because... let me find it for you. Hold on a second, because it's so fucking ridiculous.
*  They want Captain Marvel to step down and be replaced by a gay woman of color.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Because, I mean, is that how the comic book was originally?
*  Was the original comic book a gay woman?
*  Well, so, no, I'm not a comic book fan, but I know that this is something that's particularly affected comic books
*  in terms of Thor and Iron Man.
*  There it is.
*  Okay.
*  We need Brie Larson to step down from her role to prove she's an ally of social justice
*  and ensure a gay woman of color plays the role.
*  Let Monica, the original female, and all caps, black Captain Marvel,
*  instead of whitewashing characters for the benefit of the straight white men running Disney.
*  First of all, Disney is run by a woman.
*  This should be clarified. I'm almost positive.
*  The CEO of entertainment at Disney is a woman.
*  Is that right?
*  Pretty sure that's true. Yeah.
*  They've still got Walt on ice, though, haven't they? He's still in the cabin.
*  Yeah, they've got his head at least.
*  Bob Iger.
*  No, but the entertainment, the CEO of the...
*  There's someone who runs the film division...
*  Whitney Cummings is explaining it to me about how ridiculous it is.
*  But isn't Brie Larson...
*  Whoever makes the decisions.
*  Isn't Brie Larson super woke? Like, she's got a reputation for being incredibly woke.
*  Not woke enough if you're white.
*  But she was the one who said that she wanted to ban male journalists from her press junkets.
*  Maybe it's Fox.
*  You know, I don't think... either way, I don't think you can...
*  That reminds me of when, you know, Camille Parlier, the academic...
*  Go back to that. She tries to ban male writers from press junkets.
*  Oh, no, sorry. Brie Larson made a speech about how she wants...
*  She felt that there were too many male critics assessing her work and she wanted to actually implement some kind of strategy to prevent that from happening.
*  Yeah, it was all over the press.
*  So she's about as woke as it gets.
*  That's not woke enough. She needs to step down.
*  Because if you're really woke, you'll step down and show that you're an ally for social justice and give up those millions of dollars to some other person.
*  But by the way, you know, tell the studio that you're going to do that.
*  They're not going to fucking just decide, oh, you want us to cast a black gay woman? Let's do that.
*  And does it matter which black gay woman? Does it have to be someone who can act?
*  They have to be the gayest, blackest woman you can find because if you have like a half black and kind of gay, like pansexual woman, that's a part of the patriarchy.
*  Right, that's a problem, isn't it? It's like when Obama fucks up, people blame it on his white side.
*  You know, it's like, you know, because he's 50% white, he's 50% problematic.
*  You can never have the kind of purity.
*  The example I was given with Camille Pailer, because she's an academic who was asked to step down by her own students.
*  And they said you need to, to the faculty, you need to replace her with a queer woman of color.
*  Like who? But why does a woman have to be queer?
*  If you want a woman of color, like you see, this is the thing. It never ends. You can't be woke enough.
*  And once it gets to queer woman of color and they've got one of those, they go, you know what? You should make room for a transgender.
*  And what if the queer woman of color is really bad at her job?
*  Too bad. It doesn't matter. You need to adapt. You need to help her.
*  Right. Okay. And understand the society has fucked her over. And that's why she's not as good as Camille Pagley was.
*  So again, it gets back to one of their fundamental premises that they don't believe in objective truth.
*  They think objective truth. This is a postmodern thing, right? They don't believe in it.
*  It's also these people that you're talking about, they haven't built these structures that they want to tear down.
*  Right. Right. They're not a part of the construction of these enormous film studios, enormous entertainment empires.
*  Yeah. That's, you know, so they want to step in to something that not only have they not built, but they're not capable of building.
*  Right. Because they're wrapped up in this fucking wacky ideology that doesn't allow you to be creative.
*  So how do we get out of it? Like, I.
*  That's a good question. That's why I brought you in here. I was hoping you know.
*  Well, I've got ideas. Yeah. I've got a few ideas, right? Because because I think I think we're reaching a kind of tipping point.
*  Like I say, like there's so many people who are really sick of it, you know, and you can't argue with a social justice activist.
*  You can't because they don't believe they think that any knowledge that you think you have is based on your background and your and the power structures and that sort of stuff.
*  Right. So they don't.
*  Exactly. So none of it is authentic enough. And it really foxes them though when they end up like talking to a queer woman of colour, say who agrees with me.
*  And then it fucks up their entire position. It really annoys them.
*  It's but then, yeah, so you can't argue with them. I thought maybe satire would be a good approach that, you know, because if they're not prepared to listen to reason, you can mock them.
*  Right. Right. I thought that would be a good, but it just makes them really angry.
*  You know, I've got I've had so much venom for mocking this. But of course, when you mock the priests, they get angry.
*  Yes. That's the point. Yes. And they don't feel like you have any right to make fun, which is for me as a comedian, one of the most offensive things a person would say.
*  It also makes you want to do it more. Right. Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's that's what it's about. Yeah. We're we're the mockery police. Yeah, we come in and mock when things are fucked up.
*  But then because they believe in the power structures, what they're saying is you're punching down down. Yeah. You're punching down.
*  But arguably with woke people, you're not punching down. You're not. No, that's always been my argument.
*  Yeah. Because for one thing, I think you can punch down if you want. Sure. You know, who gets to say. But I think the the woke people have incredible power.
*  And they're bullies and the bullies. They they pile up together. They go after you.
*  They'll do it for days on end and attack your Twitter and attack you and write articles about you. I've experienced it. Yeah.
*  Yeah. But it's you know, you just treat preaching to the choir. Yeah. You're preaching to them.
*  And this whole idea that you can't punch down in comedy is the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my life.
*  Look, Sam Kinnison, who's one of the greatest comics of all time, one of his best bits was about starving babies in Africa.
*  You can't punch any lower. No. Did you ever see that? I didn't. I remember Kinnison talking about how comedy attacks.
*  That was something he did. His style for sure. Everybody's comedy is different. Yeah. Comedy does whatever it is that is funny, whether you are Steven Wright, who's an absurdist.
*  Yeah. Or whether you're Sam Kinnison, who attacks. Yeah. Both brilliant.
*  But Kinnison had a bit about those commercials where you would see Sally Fields on TV like Save the Children. Yeah.
*  These children survive on just a dollar a day if you could just send money.
*  And he goes, you're sitting there eating your food. You cooked yourself and this starving kids on TV and you get all bummed out and you're like, hey, why don't you feed them?
*  You're standing right next to him. And he has this whole bit. It just occurred to us.
*  We just drove 5000 miles with the food. We realized it wouldn't be world hunger if you people would move where the food is. You live in a fucking desert.
*  And he has this whole crazy bit. And it's like one of those bits that he did in 1986. And I mean, at the time, there was nothing like it. Yeah.
*  You know, like in this fucking rabid former preacher genius comedian is punching down as far as you can.
*  Yeah. Except, you know, like he's he obviously doesn't think it's funny that babies starve to death. Right.
*  But this is that literal minded thing that means that that sort of stuff can't work anymore. Yes.
*  Because well, it can work. Actually, it does work. You know, I see comics do that sort of stuff all the time, but they're not going to get very far.
*  Televisa Lee or all that kind of well for now. Yeah, you can if you go on YouTube. Yeah.
*  There's a lot of comics that are bypassing the well Netflix gives you a lot of leeway, but only if you're famous. Yeah.
*  You can get away with a lot of shit if you're famous like Chappelle can basically get away with a lot of shit.
*  They've never told Netflix has never told me what to do. Right. But I know they do. If you're not a name, you know, I know I've had friends that they've they've told to cut bits out like Joey Diaz had a hilarious me to bid about Terry Cruz.
*  Yeah, about you know, Terry Cruz, who's a fucking super athlete, you know, and some guy grabbed his dick and he me to this guy for grabbing his deck some drunken agent. Yeah.
*  Whatever it was, you know, in a joke way. I don't know what happened. I have no idea what happened. Yeah. But Joey had this hilarious bit about it and they wouldn't let him do it. Right.
*  And then like that's you're you're making fun of sexual assault victims like but do you think in any world that Terry Cruz, who is a fucking tank of a man was actually scared of this guy like this is come on.
*  This is not a victim in the sense of like a helpless person. Right. I get the fact that this guy was an agent maybe had some power over his career.
*  But the way Joey said it was a positive it was talking about all the positive attributes of Terry Cruz. He was putting his spin on. Yes. And what was this for?
*  This was for a TV show for Netflix. And they actually stepped in and said they were they didn't want the backlash. They didn't want to deal with the bullshit. So I wondered about that because I like when I was watching the comedy at the store the other day here and I just thought it feels different here.
*  Like it feels like live comedy here. People do go for whatever targets they want. We go for it because we realize this is the last stand. Right. This is like the ghost dance for wild comedy.
*  Because we don't I get the impression in the UK it's not you know the gigs I've been playing there isn't that quality about it. You need Ricky Gervais to be there all the time. Right. There's only one of him. Yeah. But that's the problem. He needs more of those. He's so rich and he doesn't have a boss and he can do whatever he wants. Exactly.
*  You know it's those insulated it's those younger comics right who are coming up and they self censored because they're worried about what they're going to say. You know that's that's basically what it is. I mean I had an argument with a young comic and and she said to me you know you don't understand because I go up to comics.
*  I have to go to comics every night after they're set and explain to them why they shouldn't tell these jokes and why they you know this was a serious conversation. I thought this isn't for you. She was a comic. Yeah. Stand up. Yeah.
*  This was a this was a comic in a group. So I used to run this like workshop for young young standups and I can't do it anymore because one of them complained. This is serious right. So like one of them complained to the boss.
*  The but it's a very famous theater in London and one of them complained and said that the one of the jokes I tweeted as Titania made her feel unsafe and then therefore I was told I couldn't I couldn't do this course anymore because I developed an unsafe environment.
*  Oh you made them feel unsafe. Yeah. By a joke. Dangerous. That wasn't even my it was to tell it was a character must have been a great joke. You really fucking great. Yeah. So good. You made someone feel unsafe. Yeah. They were laughing so hard. Yeah. Like I could die. Yeah.
*  I could die from laughter. But that's that conflation of words and violence isn't this idea that that is a problem. And I think what really scares me about that is I think they believe it. It's disingenuous. Do you think it's disingenuous. It's clearly disingenuous but it's the the orthodoxy right.
*  Like this is this is what they're pushing. So they're pushing that words are violence and that you can be violent with words. So that's interesting because I think you're probably right in a lot of cases you know when they say like if they see a certain image or something it makes them feel like they've been physically attacked or they hear a certain phrase or whatever. And they support each other in this nonsense. But then I see some of them by bawling their eyes out crying and shaking and I think that's an authentic emotion right. So maybe they're just trying to make you feel safe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I think it's disingenuous in some cases but maybe some people have actually and this would scare me more that some people have actually convinced themselves that it is a kind of form of violence.
*  I'm sure that's true as well. I'm sure that's true as well and I think there's this is again parallels really crazy religious people. Right. Right. Yeah. There's people that will cut off fingers for you know slights and against their religion they'll flog themselves.
*  I mean people do horrendous things to themselves as punishment. Right. So then it comes if we are going to go with the religious motive it comes about sort of de radicalizing people from this belief system.
*  It seems like this is a part of being a human that there are pathways that people go down like to just to get away from that. Here's one. Okay. The dictator right. The horrific dictator.
*  When someone gets into a position of power over someone whether it's a CEO of a company before the Me Too movement that's out of control and is trying to fuck all of his employees and treats people like shit and sexually harasses everybody.
*  God damn it. That seems like an archetype. Right. It's like this this archetype seems to almost be unavoidable with certain types of human beings. Sure. Well I think you get that with the woke thing and that the structure of wokeness is just it is just a scaffolding for this.
*  I think that's probably right. Tom Holland wrote is a historian. He wrote a book recently called Dominion. He makes this case that with the absence of Christianity.
*  In comes wokeness that it one sort of just just follows from the other in a kind of because they have the similar need to prescelatize people from the system of behavior.
*  Yes.
*  The similar intolerance of anyone who might not perceive the world in the way that you do, you know, so it has all the same hallmarks. But also that makes sense.
*  Right.
*  It's based on faith it's based on something that's intangible.
*  Yes trusty.
*  to convert, the similar intolerance of anyone who might not perceive the world in the way that you
*  do, you know. So, it has all the same hallmarks, but also that makes me nervous about it because
*  it's not then about persuading someone out of it, because you can't persuade someone their God
*  doesn't exist. It's based on faith, it's based on something that's intangible.
*  Pete Yes.
*  Matthew And particularly when those same people have such power in the major institutions, right?
*  I've always said the woke people are the minority. Most people are sick of it, most people are
*  fucked off with it. But they seem to occupy all these major roles in television, in the arts,
*  in media, in journalism, in the law, you know, and therefore they have disproportionate clout.
*  Pete Yes. Academia is a big one.
*  Matthew Academia is, that's where the problem started.
*  Pete Right. And then you convert children to think that way. You get an impressionable
*  17-year-old who's a freshman in college and they find this and it resonates with them. And also,
*  they can develop social clout by adhering to this religion the same way a radical, you know, fill
*  in the blank with whatever Christian, whatever sect of religion you'd like to compare it to.
*  It's very similar. The more pious you are, the more adherent you are to the dogma, to this rigid
*  ideology, the more clout you get. Matthew And worse than that in universities
*  because you won't pass the course. And what's interesting is it's not a kind of
*  underhand thing on the part of the scholars who are now activists, right? They are open about this.
*  Pete Yes.
*  Matthew They say quite explicitly, you know, we are activists as well as scholars,
*  which means they're pushing a political agenda, which of course, it didn't used to be that. The
*  academia used to be about objectivity and presenting different ideas and getting to the
*  truth, but they already know the truth. And they're going to ensure that you wouldn't even
*  get on the course if you didn't sort of basically subscribe.
*  Pete Again, it's the same sort of pattern that you see in dictators. They're a dictator in terms of
*  intellectual pursuits. They're dictating to these children how you must think and behave.
*  And they're, because of their position of power, because of their education, their grasp of the
*  English language, the fact that they speak so eloquently and passionately about this,
*  they're incredibly convincing and charismatic, a lot of them. And it's effective.
*  Matthew Yes.
*  Pete And that's why so many people come from that and so overwhelmingly left leaning.
*  Matthew Yeah, hugely. Exactly. It's a real problem on the left.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Matthew It's really weird to me that I've suddenly, most of my friends now are right leaning. That's
*  come out of nowhere. I wouldn't have expected that at all.
*  But it's a shift over the last few years and it's the reason why Trump is in office.
*  Matthew Yeah, 100% it is. This is why, when people tell me the culture wars like a sideshow,
*  it doesn't matter. I'm like, it wins and loses elections, this stuff, you know?
*  Pete It's not a sideshow.
*  Matthew It really isn't.
*  Pete No.
*  Matthew What was it the other day? Was Elizabeth Warren saying that she's going to get a trans
*  stud pupil, like a 15-year-old, to veto her, one of her appointees, right?
*  Pete Was it the Secretary of Education?
*  Matthew Yeah, something like that.
*  Pete Something like that. But it was a 9-year-old.
*  Matthew Was it a 9-year-old? I thought it was like 15-year-old.
*  Pete Pull that up.
*  Matthew Either way, that's not good, right?
*  Pete No, either way, it's not good. It's madness.
*  Matthew And most people think that's madness and most people think it's weird. Like,
*  in the UK, Jeremy Corbyn started announcing his pronouns.
*  Pete Yes, I saw!
*  Matthew Let me tell you, I don't know if you know what Jeremy Corbyn looks like. No one's confused
*  about his pronouns. No one has ever been confused about it.
*  Pete He's got a fucking beard.
*  Matthew Women can have beards, what are you saying?
*  Pete Oh, I didn't know. They also can have penises and men can have their periods.
*  Matthew Yeah, but Jeremy Corbyn's never identified as a woman as far as I'm concerned.
*  Pete So dumb.
*  Matthew You know, it doesn't fit with also that old school socialist,
*  because he's proper old school lefty socialist. The woke stuff doesn't fit well with those people.
*  It doesn't work. It feels weird, you know?
*  Pete Well, the old school lefty socialist is more about compassion and income equality.
*  Matthew It's money.
*  Pete Yes.
*  Matthew All about money. This is actually one of the reasons why I wanted to time it to be.
*  Pete Here we go.
*  Matthew Oh, here we go. Oh, no, so this was the round of applause that the 9-year-old transgender
*  child got. So, the child stood up and said, I'm a 9-year-old and Elizabeth Warren sort of
*  instigated this big round of applause for that. There was something else this week though,
*  it was a 15-year-old, it was someone that she decided she'd choose.
*  Pete Yes, she'd choose. I think it was the Secretary of Education, but I might be wrong.
*  What is it?
*  Matthew That's the Secretary of Education, it's a quote from this.
*  Pete Oh, okay.
*  Matthew Yeah, yeah.
*  Pete So, what is it? Do you find the quote?
*  Matthew Here we go.
*  Pete Oh, it's the wrong story though.
*  Matthew Oh, it is the wrong story?
*  Pete This is the one from October.
*  Matthew The Secretary of Education both believes in public education and believes in…
*  Yeah, but no, she was going to veto, she was going to give the transgender student veto power.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Matthew And help, see if you can find that.
*  Pete I mean, for one thing, I wouldn't give a 15-year-old trans or otherwise,
*  any kind of political input.
*  Matthew No, and definitely not a 9-year-old. Any kid,
*  God damn it. When you're 15, you don't know what the fuck is going on. You've only been alive for
*  a few months. You really have no idea what's happening.
*  Matthew I mean, your frontal lobes aren't developed, are they?
*  Pete No, 25.
*  Matthew In fact, let's raise the voting age. Don't let them make it 30.
*  Pete Well, then the real problem would be war.
*  Matthew Bill Marr talked about this story on his most recent episode of his show.
*  Matthew Yeah.
*  Matthew And so, it got up in the news again.
*  Pete No, there was a legitimate news story about Elizabeth Warren talking about…
*  In that quote, it says that Warren indicated she wants Jacob to help her pick her…
*  Matthew Oh, I see.
*  Pete Oh, okay.
*  Matthew So, it's a repeat of the same story.
*  Pete That's it. Okay, okay. So, they just sort of
*  repeated it and got a headline out of it.
*  Matthew I mean, I get why that advertises her commitment to inclusivity and diversity. But 99%
*  of people are thinking, I don't care about that. Why don't you talk about the fact that I can't
*  afford anything? And that's why if you are truly left leaning, and if you truly care about getting
*  a left leaning government in power, you need to make it back class again. Because this is one of
*  the reasons why like Titania, I wanted her to be posh and rich, you know, because they're so rich,
*  these people, predominantly. They've got so much money.
*  Pete Because if you have real problems, this is not what you concentrate on.
*  Matthew Like, you're not worried about man spreading.
*  Who worries about that stuff? Someone on the poverty line doesn't care about this stuff.
*  They don't care about being represented by the skin color of, like, you know, some poor
*  working class mother who can't afford anything, isn't going to care that Hillary Clinton's in the
*  White House. She's not going to think, oh, well, that's okay, then I'm represented. That's great.
*  Pete Well, some of them would. Some of them would like it because it will make them feel like a woman
*  can get by and get through.
*  Matthew That's the aspirational message that it sends. I think that's fine. But you're still
*  stuck on the poverty line with nothing, you know. Poor black Americans didn't do very well under
*  Obama. This stuff is tokenism when what you should be doing is sort of directing at inequality.
*  And it's a big problem both here and in the UK, you know. We've got a left movement. I mean,
*  we saw it with Brexit, you know. The reason why so many working class people voted for Brexit,
*  and indeed voted against labor in the last election, is because they're not being,
*  no one's looking out for their interests anymore. They're worried about other things like,
*  like you say, man spreading, man explaining, like toxic masculinity.
*  Man explaining is hilarious.
*  Matthew Well, it's just explaining.
*  Pete Explaining, if you're a man, if you correct someone and they're incorrect and you're a man,
*  you're mansplaining. Well, then you're still mansplaining.
*  Matthew Well, that's not how we, we can't live like that. I can't, I can't live like that. I can't.
*  Pete Where does it go? Does it become a religious war? Are we in a holy war for wokeness?
*  Matthew I don't know, but I don't have to, I don't want to have to check the contents of
*  someone's underwear every time I have a discussion with them, you know. I don't, like, I don't want
*  to make those judgments on that basis. Pete Well, you need to understand and check
*  yourself because the contents of someone's underwear does not mean that that's the gender
*  in which they identify with you piece of shit. You already fucked it up.
*  Matthew That's it. I don't know. I don't know.
*  Pete You're going to cancel yourself now? You should.
*  Matthew Well, I've already been cancelled probably. I don't know. That might be a good
*  example, that might be a good idea. Maybe Titania gets cancelled. Maybe I should find a way to have
*  her. Pete Yes.
*  Matthew Because she probably messes up sometimes.
*  Pete Well, once we will find out that Titania is actually a man.
*  Matthew Yeah. Well, you know what, I'll do it because I just, it's funny you mentioned the
*  transgender child because I've just written a book as her aimed at children, right? Because of that,
*  have you seen this, you've seen the woke children's books, right?
*  Pete Yes. I made a joke about one, Feminist Baby, she's got a bullhorn.
*  Matthew Feminist Baby.
*  Pete A bullhorn. Does a feminist need a bullhorn? Jesus Christ. She's screaming about issues,
*  she's a baby. Matthew Yeah, but she needs to be heard. Don't silence the truth.
*  Pete Look at that.
*  Matthew Feminist Baby.
*  Pete Finds her voice. Her voice is in a bullhorn?
*  Matthew Right, there we go.
*  Pete Meanwhile, if she's a feminist, why is she wearing fucking makeup when she's a baby?
*  That's just rude. That's rude because that's the goddamn patriarchy.
*  Matthew That's socializing young babies to be sex objects.
*  Pete Oh, that's a boy. He's a feminist too.
*  Matthew Oh, is that a boy?
*  Pete Christ. How does he even know what a boy or a girl is?
*  Matthew How many of these are there?
*  Baby.
*  Matthew These look like they're aimed very much at very young kids as well.
*  Pete Yeah. Well, it's aimed at the mothers and fathers of very young kids who want to let
*  everybody know their work and they probably only pull them out when people come over the house.
*  Matthew Oh, yeah, just put them on the coffee table.
*  Pete So everyone knows.
*  Matthew Yes, exactly.
*  Matthew But this is, you're scraping the surface here. So,
*  one of the big selling books was Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, which is like each
*  chapter is about a major feminist icon. That's aimed at young kids. There's one called
*  See is for Consent. That's aimed at very young kids. There's one called The Little Girl Who Gave Zero
*  Fucks. Right? This sort of, you know what? It's funny. I look at this stuff. I think this is such
*  flagrant indoctrination. You're not even hiding it anymore. It is nothing subtle about this, you know?
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Matthew So, I've written a book as to Tanya and she's trying to,
*  it's called My First Little Book of Intersectional Activism, right? Because she can't get it right.
*  She talks to kids like they're just sociologists or something. She can't get it right, which is
*  fun. And she says to them, you know, your parents hate you. You know, you should ditch them. I think
*  that's the way to do it.
*  Pete Well, that's what every cult does.
*  Matthew Yeah, exactly.
*  Pete One of the things that cults do, one of the hallmarks of cults is they try to separate you from
*  your parents.
*  Matthew Yeah. Or if you get the kids young, then you can get their minds eventually.
*  Pete Yes.
*  Matthew So, maybe that's, is that the solution trying to make sure it doesn't get the young, maybe?
*  Pete I don't know if there is a solution. I think there are patterns that always exist.
*  And religions pop up like, why Christianity? Why Mormonism? Why Islam? Why, you know, what causes
*  these patterns, these ideological patterns? What causes them? What causes them to take hold? What
*  causes them to, their followers to become rabid? I don't know what it is, but they exist and they
*  exist, they have existed throughout history. There's literally hundreds of them.
*  Matthew Is it a need for purpose? Is it a need to feel that you are the one pursuing the truth?
*  Pete It's certainly, there's instincts that we all have to be a part of a group and to be accepted
*  as a part of a group and one of the ways that you show that you're a part of that group is by rigidly
*  adhering to the doctrine.
*  Matthew Well, here's one way that we might legitimately tackle this. I'm going to say
*  something very optimistic now. If more people on the left can turn against wokeness, I think this
*  will really help. I think once they realize that it is undermining all the things they stand for,
*  it's getting Trump into power, it's getting the Tories into power in the UK, you know?
*  It's dividing us up racially in terms of our sexual demographics, it's pushing for further
*  segregation. It actually does all the things that the social justice movement claims that they
*  don't want to do and that they want to fight. And if more people on the left sort of turn,
*  and the other thing, here's the other thing. They all think we live in this world full of Nazis
*  and fascists and these evil crypto-fascists around every corner, right? And by making that claim,
*  you are really helping the genuine neo-Nazis out there because you're saying, look, you're mainstream.
*  It's giving them much more power and attention than they deserve. I think it's a really bad
*  idea. It's almost like you're acting as their PR, you know?
*  Pete Yeah, you're almost making it more acceptable to be a Nazi because you're calling everyone a
*  Nazi and you're also crying wolf. So because you're crying wolf, when someone sees an act,
*  like Charlottesville was a big wake-up call for a lot of people because they're like,
*  holy fuck, those are real Nazis. Nazis are real. They're still Nazi Nazis, like with the swastika
*  tattoos and everything, the tiki torches, those fucking guys. That was a wake-up call for a lot
*  of folks because there's many people that never encounter people like that.
*  Jamie Of course, because there's not many of them.
*  Pete Right, but they hear everybody's a Nazi. They hear this is a Nazi, that's a Nazi.
*  You know, Christina Hoff Sommers gives speeches places and they pull the fire alarm on her. They
*  call her a Nazi. She's a feminist.
*  Pete How is she, like even remotely?
*  Jamie It's insane, but she criticizes other feminists for being preposterous and when she
*  does that, people decide that she has not towed the line. She's not rigidly adhering to the ideology.
*  She's not woken up, so they attack her. She's what you would think of as maybe a centrist feminist.
*  But that's historically illiterate. If you think that that's fascism, then you don't know what
*  fascism is. And also, that's really offensive to the people who have had to live through
*  fascistic regimes to say that Christina Hoff Sommers is a fucking fascist.
*  Pete It is, but I don't think they care what, you know, what the previous definition of fascism is.
*  Jamie I think we've got to stand by that definition. We've got to root it in the actual
*  definition. You know, like if you want to say that Jordan Peterson is a fascist, as some people do,
*  there isn't someone who is more on record, whose opposition to tyranny is more on record.
*  Pete And more studied in it.
*  Jamie Forty years of this stuff and it's all online. Should you wish to check it out. But
*  that involves a degree of research and actually knowing what you're talking about.
*  Pete He gets pointed out as one of the more problematic guests that I have on.
*  Jamie Really?
*  Pete When people point to the fact that I'm some sort of an alt-right gateway.
*  They point to Jordan Peterson. It's so ridiculous.
*  Jamie What is this gateway business as well?
*  Pete Nonsense.
*  Did you see the alternative influence network thing?
*  Jamie Yes.
*  Pete Were you on that?
*  Jamie Yeah, I was on that.
*  Pete You were on that?
*  Jamie For sure. I said to her, I tweeted to her, I said, hey, what did I say? I said,
*  Barbara Walters interviewed Castro. Does that make her a communist?
*  Pete Right.
*  Jamie And she said, and she screenshotted it and said,
*  he's favorably comparing himself to Barbara Walters.
*  Pete Oh, Jesus.
*  Jamie He can't win. It doesn't make any sense.
*  That six degrees of separation stuff, that flow chart nonsense.
*  Pete It's all nonsense.
*  Jamie It's conspiratorial. But that was a mainstream
*  publication, wasn't it? That wasn't some rogue…
*  Pete I mean, sure, but look, the only people that are taking it seriously are the people that
*  are woke. I mean, regular people are not going to take that seriously. It's ridiculous. That
*  six degrees of separation shit is nuts. Guilt by association is nuts. It's crazy, especially when
*  you're talking to people like me that interview literally hundreds and hundreds of people.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jamie It's crazy.
*  Pete But does it bother you when people throw those smears at you or do you just completely
*  ignore it?
*  Jamie It bothers me less every day. It's interesting. I've developed this sort of
*  anti-venom to it because I've experienced it so many times.
*  Pete I used to get really upset when people call me a Nazi because I thought that's like
*  the opposite of what I stand for. I genuinely…
*  Jamie Yeah.
*  Pete But now, it's that thing of you see someone be called a Nazi or a racist even,
*  or a homophobe and you think, I don't, that probably isn't right.
*  Jamie Yes, right.
*  Pete And that means if you do actually ever have to use those words, like those awful people in
*  Charlottesville, where you should reserve that word so that we can identify those people in our
*  midst because they do exist. They are dangerous, but there's not many of them. But if the word has
*  become so, it doesn't mean that anymore. It's this thing called concept creep, you know, where
*  the idea of the word just spreads and spreads so that anyone with the slightest point of
*  political disagreement can suddenly be branded as neo-fascist.
*  Jamie That's what the McCarthyism era is all about.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jamie Find all the demons in your neighborhood.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jamie Everyone's bad. Everyone's evil. Everyone turns on each other. I mean, this is what North
*  Korea does. What North Korea has that's so brilliant is everyone tattles on everyone else.
*  Pete Yeah, of course.
*  Jamie And they're all running around scared.
*  And this is what the woke people are doing. No one can be woke enough. I mean,
*  Martina Navatolova, they went after her. She's a lesbian, but she's not woke enough because
*  she doesn't want trans women to compete in sports and dominate and win world records.
*  Pete So, she shouldn't be part of that community anymore. You see, I've got a real problem with
*  the whole acronym thing, the LGBTQIA+, whatever it is at the moment because it keeps getting longer.
*  Jamie But I love it. I want it to get longer.
*  What is it now? It's lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersexual, asexual.
*  Pete Yeah. And what's the plus?
*  Jamie The plus is whatever fucker we've forgotten, basically.
*  Pete Aliens.
*  Jamie Whatever isn't there, yeah. Who the fuck knows? I mean, I see that as, for a start,
*  there's massive internal contradictions within that. Like, we're seeing this at the moment with
*  sort of lesbians versus trans people and gay rights versus trans rights, women's rights versus,
*  you know, that's not a coherent, it's not like those people are all the same.
*  Pete It's a weird gang.
*  Jamie It's a gang that doesn't get on with itself.
*  Pete Right, exactly.
*  Jamie That's what Dave Chappelle's bit about, that was really good, with the sort of the T's in the
*  back and the L's in the front and stuff. It's, they don't get on with each other and then,
*  and then, if you're not ideologically pure, they'll cast you out. They'll even say you're
*  not gay, like with Peter Thiel. You know, when he said at the Republican convention that he was
*  supporting Trump. And the advocate, the gay magazine, the advocate was saying, well, he may
*  sleep with men, but he's not gay. He doesn't get to be gay anymore.
*  Pete Oh, God!
*  Jamie That's the gay press for you. I mean, the advocate, the Out magazine, there's a really
*  funny article in Out magazine, which was criticizing the new It film, you know, the clown,
*  the killer clown, right? The second chapter starts with a gay bashing at the start,
*  and he eats a gay man's heart in the opening scene of that film.
*  Pete Oh, spoiler alert.
*  Jamie Sorry about that.
*  Pete I was going to watch it.
*  Jamie And Out magazine said, oh, Pennywise the clown isn't the gay ally we thought he was.
*  And this was an authentic, I'm like, well, he's a psychopathic clown, isn't he?
*  He eats kids' arms and drags them into the sewer. He was your ally?
*  Jamie I love the gay press. The gay press made me laugh so much. There's one in the UK called
*  Pink News, right? And if you want to laugh at something, just look at their – they did a
*  thing recently – I'm not making this up, this was like two weeks ago – the Pakistani government
*  have announced that they're going to pay for people to transition. They're going to pay for
*  their surgery, right? You know why? Because they fucking hate gay people. So, they're going to pay
*  for it. And the pink –
*  Pete Because they only will allow men to have sex with men if the men transition to female.
*  Jamie Right. Okay. So, this is not a pro-gay stance. The Pink News did a video saying,
*  yeah, Pakistan said yes to trans rights. This is a really empowering thing. I'm like,
*  they hate you. Like, this is – it's genuinely nuts. So, I wonder whether we should just get rid
*  of the letters, just scrap it. Like –
*  Pete I think they should keep adding more.
*  Jamie Really?
*  Pete Yeah, make up a bunch of different names. Get it so it's so preposterous that even woke
*  people like, Jesus Christ, 30 letters. We have letters that aren't even real symbols.
*  Jamie They'll have to go to different alphabets.
*  Pete Prince's symbol.
*  Jamie Oh, yeah, that could be – yeah, they could do that,
*  couldn't they?
*  Pete Yeah, I mean, look, it's in unknown territory right now.
*  Jamie Yeah.
*  Pete Really is. We're completely off the deep end. And with this incredible ability to communicate
*  that we have today, because of social media, we can spread these ideas. We can, you know,
*  people can hop on board and other mentally ill people can, you know, decide that you are
*  absolutely correct. And we do need to add some Zs and Xs and other shit to that.
*  Jamie The thing is, you say it as a joke, and then one day –
*  Pete It's not a joke.
*  Jamie It'll happen.
*  Pete I think everything's a joke, but it's not a joke. I mean, it can happen.
*  Jamie It does happen. I mean, the number of times I've tweeted something to take the piss,
*  and then it's happened a few months later –
*  Pete Oh, yeah.
*  Jamie I'm not – like, it's pretty much all the time now.
*  Pete Oh, yeah.
*  Jamie The one I often mention, because I just, I still can't get over it,
*  was when Titania tweeted about Mary Poppins. You know, there's a scene in Mary Poppins where she
*  has chimney soot on her face. And so, Titania tweeted saying this is blackface. This is so
*  racist. Blackface. Six months later, the New York Times published an article saying exactly that,
*  saying Mary Poppins is racist because of blackface.
*  Pete Because she had soot on her face?
*  Jamie Yeah.
*  Pete You could find it. It's New York Times and it's Mary Poppins and Nanny's shameful
*  flirting with blackface. That's the headline of that article, right?
*  Pete What?
*  Jamie I'm not making it up. And they used a screenshot of her with chimney soot on.
*  Pretty much similar to the screenshot I'd taken six months before, right? It's not racist.
*  Pete But it's changed so much in six months,
*  like things have shifted so bizarrely. Look at this. Mary Poppins and Nanny's shameful
*  flirting with blackface. That is –
*  Jamie This is a major publication.
*  Pete That is god damned hilarious.
*  Jamie But this isn't even like some blog.
*  Pete Shameful flirting with blackface.
*  Jamie That's the New York Times.
*  Pete Who wrote that? Who's that person?
*  Jamie I don't know who that person is but –
*  Pete I only want to say his name. It's fucking Voldemort. Is that the one you're not supposed
*  to say the name? Or what's the other one? Jamie
*  Yeah, you can't say Voldemort. You just did.
*  Pete Jesus Christ. That is so god damn crazy.
*  Jamie This happens – we had it in the UK. I don't
*  know if this story got broke over here. You know the new musical Cats, the film of Cats,
*  the Andrew Lloyd Webber thing, right? Did you see that?
*  Pete Yes. No, I didn't see it.
*  Jamie One of the mixed race actors plays a white cat
*  and there were articles about how they've whitewashed this black actor,
*  but they've also turned her into a cat. It's not – you know what I mean? It's not a racist –
*  Pete I can't remember her name but it's –
*  Pete Yeah, I know what you're saying. Yeah.
*  Jamie You know, it's like – stop trying to – this is it. If you're going to – why not just – this
*  is why I say get the left on board. Why not just reserve the accusation of racism for actual racists?
*  Pete Well, I think the left thinks of the woke left the same way they think of Antifa,
*  that they are on the fringe but they're doing good work. Like they're not me. I don't think
*  that way but at least they're attacking those right wing pieces of shit that I hate.
*  Jamie I see.
*  Pete So even though they're crazy and ridiculous – not they're crazy and ridiculous but they're
*  not coming after me. They're coming after people that I disagree with so they don't find it
*  a problem.
*  Jamie But it'd be one thing if – I mean, I don't support violence anyway but it'd be one thing if
*  Antifa were going after actual fascists but when they're just pepper spraying someone with a
*  MAGA hat or you know, or going after Andy Ngo, you know, sort of gay Vietnamese person –
*  Pete Or Christina Hoff Sommers.
*  Jamie Or Christina Hoff Sommers. Then it's difficult to take them seriously.
*  Pete And they're wearing masks and hitting people with bike locks and all the craziness and
*  you know, it's…
*  Jamie And they're the compassionate ones, right? So this is the incoherence of that. If you set
*  yourself as this kind of moral arbiter and you're doing everything in virtue but you're hitting
*  someone with a bike lock rather than engaging them in conversation, then how do you even talk to that?
*  How do you even address that, you know?
*  Pete Yeah, you really can't, right? What they're willing to do is they're willing to attack people
*  that they disagree with. They're willing to shut down discussion. They're willing to – like if
*  someone wants to come and speak and that person happens to be right-wing, they feel completely
*  100% justified in shutting down the speech, hitting fire alarms, telling people they don't feel safe,
*  attacking people that are trying to come into the venue, screaming at old people.
*  I mean, we've seen all this stuff that happens with Antifa.
*  Jamie This is a serious problem that I think is going to get worse here very quickly, right?
*  Because up until now, I've always thought you guys are in a really great position. You've got
*  your First Amendment, you know, so people will always be able to say whatever they want in this
*  country, you know? But you're seeing the cracks in that ideal very, very clearly and some people
*  are calling for hate speech laws so that the First Amendment doesn't apply to what they call hate
*  speech. And that would be the – rather than just, I mean, yeah, you've got people setting off fire
*  alarms, literally stopping people from speaking that way. But I think there are people who are
*  moving towards legislating against certain forms of speech.
*  Well, it's very important that this be taught and that people understand that the answer to bad
*  speech is good speech. That's always been the answer to get two people that have opposing ideas
*  and have them talk and have one person who has the better ideas, who's more articulate and
*  understands it and understands the consequences of these evil ideas and lays it out so that
*  everybody watching can go, oh, okay, I see, now I learned. But as soon as you stop it,
*  you know, if they say, we want Ben Shapiro to debate our person and let's all go together,
*  that's great. Do that. Do that. That's how to do it.
*  So why would you want – if you claim to be opposed to all these horrible ideas,
*  why would you want those ideas to be left unchallenged? That doesn't make sense to me.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  What you should – you should be celebrating the idea that these people are going to get a
*  platform and be debated and be repudiated. But they're worried that that person's
*  going to indoctrinate someone and they think that they're absolutely right and that person's
*  absolutely wrong. And this is the argument for deplatforming people from Twitter and YouTube
*  and all these different social media platforms. But people aren't as stupid as that.
*  A lot of them are. But do you think – like, I don't believe
*  that someone's going to hear someone making a fascist speech and they suddenly become fascist by
*  osmosis. Let me pause you there.
*  Okay. How does someone
*  join the Nazi party? Well, I mean, do you mean the historical
*  Nazi party? No, the ones that are around today.
*  I mean, who the hell knows? But I mean, they're –
*  Morons. Okay, fine.
*  Who get indoctrinated. And that's what we're doing. We're protecting morons. We're nerfing
*  the world. But the fact is, there are so few of those people. There are so few people who are that
*  stupid. That's why there aren't many neo-Nazis. I don't think that's true.
*  Really? I have more faith in humanity. I think most people are pretty keyed up.
*  You are a smart man. Yeah.
*  And I understand why you would think that. But I think there are a lot of extremely gullible –
*  you know how many people believe the earth is flat? You aware of that?
*  I wonder whether those people are joking. When I hear that, I really do.
*  No, I've had arguments with them.
*  Really? Yeah, I've had conversations with them in real life.
*  Okay. Well, let's take – okay, so let's take that point that there are an awful lot of stupid
*  people out there. Okay, so what is – Uninformed gullible. Let's call them
*  uninformed gullible and unprepared in terms of they don't have the skills to handle any sort of weird
*  argument. Let's say I'm wrong and my optimism about humanity is wrong-headed. Okay, so – and
*  I'm willing to accept that, right? So let's say I'm wrong about that. What is better? What's the
*  best way to deal with those people? Is it to say we're going to no platform all the people who are
*  going to indoctrinate them so they never get to hear that. But we live in a world with the internet
*  where people can go on their various chat rooms and they can – and there, they can go into those
*  areas and they can hear those ideas unchallenged. They don't hear the opposing view.
*  Right. So surely, if there are all these swathes of
*  gormless people out there, that's the environment which is going to radicalize them. Not a stage at
*  some university where – I agree with you. But they want to de-platform people that would bring
*  those people over to those websites where they would get indoctrinated, right? So they want to
*  de-platform people off of social media so that those people who have these problematic ideas
*  can't drag someone over to Stormfront or whatever radical website or –
*  But we know from the history of censorship that it never works.
*  Right.
*  It never works. It always drives people towards something.
*  True. But that doesn't matter. People are stupid.
*  Just because you say you know it and we do know it, it doesn't mean people are going to think that
*  way and operate that way. That requires restraint. It requires foresight. It requires some sort of
*  an objective understanding of history. Well, I'll give you an example. So in the UK,
*  there was a far-right party called the British National Party, which does technically still
*  exist, but no, there's like 10 people in it. And the leader of that party, there was a moment
*  where they were winning millions of votes, right? Because there were a lot of people who were
*  disenfranchised, particularly in working-class areas, and they were desperate for some kind of –
*  And the head of that party, Nick Griffin, went on to our main political discussion
*  programmes called Question Time, BBC One, Prime Time, and he was humiliated.
*  And as soon as that happened, the BNP were over. Within a matter of months,
*  it exposed to those normal people the ludicrous and absurd nature of his viewpoint. And that,
*  I think, is a really heartening idea that actually if you hear more from these people,
*  they are self-discrediting, right? But if you ban them, you're almost giving them a kind of glamour,
*  a kind of martyrdom status that they don't deserve. And that, I think, attracts a lot of
*  people to their worldview. There's definitely something to be said for that. Yeah. There's
*  definitely something to be said. I mean, I'm not in favour of banning these people.
*  Yeah. But I'm also not in favour of these people being able to espouse hate speech
*  everywhere they go and to be able to indoctrinate people as well. It's like, I don't know what the
*  actual – Well, do you trust – well, I'll put it as my view. I do not trust the state to decide
*  what constitutes hate speech. I don't either. No.
*  I don't believe that – I mean, in the UK, they've proven that they're not capable of doing that.
*  Same as Canada. Right. Exactly. Absolutely, clearly. So,
*  so in that case, I'm for abolishing the idea of hate speech as a practice. We have – I don't know
*  how much you know about the UK with this, right? We have a thing where the police will investigate
*  you for non-crime if it's offensive, right? Non-crime?
*  So there's a website, the government's website on hate crime has a paragraph on non-crime hate
*  incidents, okay? And what they specifically say is if you've heard something, if someone said
*  something and it's offensive to you and you believe that that person said something because
*  of you were one of the protected characteristics because of race, gender, sexuality, disability,
*  whatever, then you report that to the police and it gets logged in the hate crime statistics as a
*  hate crime, even though there's no crime. Okay, I'll give you a very specific example of this.
*  There's a famous case in the UK at the moment, a man called Harry Miller. He was a docker from
*  Humburside and the – he retweeted a poem that was perceived to be transphobic and people were
*  upset about the poem. He didn't even write the poem. He just retweeted the poem. The police
*  investigated his retweet and he said to them, have I broken the law? They said this isn't a crime,
*  this is a non-crime hate incident and the actual phrase the police officer used, I'm not joking,
*  was we have to check your thinking, right? Whoa!
*  Now that's sinister. And then when the police, the Humburside police were challenged on this
*  but in the media, it turns out this is standard practice in the police. It isn't just one rogue
*  police officer going a bit mad. This is standard practice. The commissioning guidelines from the
*  College of Policing actually stipulate that this is what you're meant to do. This has now finally
*  been challenged in the courts but no one stood up to this stuff, you know?
*  Just a phrase, check your thinking.
*  Check your thinking.
*  By a police officer no less. Who's qualified to check your thinking? I mean, you should be –
*  It's crazy.
*  It should be difficult.
*  Well, yeah, quite. I mean, the College of Policing who teach the police what the police officer
*  actually said is he said, well, we've had a workshop and what you don't understand is that
*  babies are sometimes born with a male brain when they've got a female body. I mean, literally,
*  he was trying to lecture him on this stuff.
*  Well, that might be true but that doesn't mean that the police should be able to tell you that
*  you can't retweet something that you agree with.
*  Right. And we have people in our country who have been – do you know how many people are arrested
*  in the UK? I'll just ask, how many people do you think are arrested every year in the UK
*  for offensive comments they've posted online? What would you guess?
*  It's not a trick. I'm just interested to know what you would assume.
*  Arrested for offensive comments online. Let me say 300.
*  3,000 every year, right?
*  Now –
*  Wow.
*  And that's not including all the many thousands of non-crime
*  hate incidents that are logged.
*  Wow.
*  3,000 people arrested and what is it –
*  Some of them will be horrible by the way. I've been clear about it. Some of those comments will
*  be horrible, nasty, racist, awful. A lot of them are between rival football gangs and stuff like
*  that but some of them are jokes. One guy served three months in prison for a joke about Madeleine
*  McCann and it was a joke that he cut and pasted from some website and put it on his own Facebook
*  page. Three months in prison for that.
*  Jesus Christ. What was the joke?
*  I don't know.
*  Hope it was good.
*  I hope he was laughing for three months while he was eating terrible food.
*  Better have been worth it, right?
*  Now he's a felon, right?
*  Yeah.
*  He has a record.
*  The famous one in the UK at the moment is the Count Dankiller case.
*  Yes.
*  I do know that one.
*  Yeah.
*  And because I stood up –
*  Explain it to people that don't know that story.
*  So there's a guy called Count Dankiller, his real name is Marcus Meakin and he's a YouTuber
*  and he created his dog – sorry, his girlfriend's dog is this cute little pug dog, right?
*  And his girlfriend was always going on about how adorable the dog was.
*  So he trained the dog to jump about enthusiastically whenever it heard the phrase
*  gasp the Jews and he trained it to do a little Nazi salute whenever it heard Sieg Heil, right?
*  Now those phrases out of that context are unpleasant.
*  You can see why someone would be offended by that, right?
*  But the joke was that this cute little dog is behaving this vicious – in fact,
*  the joke is predicated on the idea that there's nothing worse than a Nazi.
*  Well, also the joke is predicated on the fact that we all know the dog has no idea what it's doing.
*  Quite exactly. Yeah.
*  So that's him doing the Sieg Heil there. So that's Buddha the dog.
*  That's cutie.
*  Now look, I accept that people can be offended.
*  Like, you know, I might be offended by it. I'm offended by all sorts of things, you know, that's fine.
*  But no, three million people saw that video before YouTube took it down, you know?
*  And three million people, not one complained. No one complained.
*  The police actually went to the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities and said,
*  do you find this offensive?
*  And understandably, they said yes and the police said, great, now we can prosecute this guy.
*  Two-year investigation.
*  Found guilty in a court of law.
*  Ultimately fined £800. That was what happened.
*  But he's got a criminal record now for whatever you think about the joke, right?
*  It is clearly meant to be funny.
*  Not only that, cybercrime intelligence unit investigated all of his tweets, emails,
*  his entire background to find any remote connection to a fascist group or a far-right group.
*  Nothing. They found nothing.
*  So there's no evidence.
*  So basically, in the UK, we now have someone who has been prosecuted because the judge
*  believes that he knows what's secretly going on, what his secret intention is.
*  And the actual phrasing of the law under which he was prosecuted is that it is deemed grossly
*  offensive, which is a very subjective idea, something that is grossly offensive.
*  Well, particularly when the fact that you have three thousand different views,
*  or three million different views and no complaints.
*  No complaints, right?
*  That's crazy.
*  And I know the guy, because I defended him at the time and then, of course,
*  people said that I'm a Nazi apologist, which is utterly, utterly lewd.
*  But I know the guy now. He's a nice guy. He's not at all.
*  I've seen him interviewed. What's up, Jamie?
*  Why you guys are talking about this, I found a story that happened last week.
*  This is a tweet that I've kind of gone through it to verify it a little bit.
*  I don't want to say it's 100% accurate, but this guy got a job interview.
*  And I guess he signed up and they found this on their own.
*  He said he did not give them his information.
*  Wow.
*  He said, I had to get a background check for my job.
*  And it turns out the report is a 300 plus page PDF of every single tweet I've ever liked,
*  liked with the word fuck in it. Enjoy your dystopian BS.
*  It's like there's a bunch of tweets showing it, but I looked at the company that does this.
*  Hold on, go back.
*  Sorry.
*  What does it say? Update.
*  I came home to a package containing a printout of all 351 pages of it.
*  Obviously the dystopia cares about wasting paper.
*  Here's like a, for instance, of what it looks like.
*  And have they used this to justify not giving him the job?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what happened to that.
*  Okay.
*  He liked this tweet. Merry Christmas to the toddler.
*  I saw running across Trader Joe's with a giant bottle of peppermint vodka
*  and mom running after him like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, only.
*  So flag type bad flag reason alcohol.
*  Yeah.
*  Post type liked.
*  Yeah. So they, they changed what he was saying.
*  Right.
*  He's, he's making a joke about a toddler that he saw running across Trader Joe's with a giant
*  bottle of peppermint vodka that it had taken from its mom. And the mom was like, no, no, no, no,
*  give me that, give me that, give me that. So they flagged it because there was alcohol in it.
*  The baby had a bottle of alcohol. There's nothing offensive about that whatsoever.
*  I actually don't understand why that would be an issue.
*  Because they want you to be scared as fuck. They want to be able to control your thinking
*  and they don't want you to ever do anything that could come back to hurt the company in any way
*  and mess with their bottom line. I mean, that is crazy.
*  But even liking a tweet, not just writing the tweet, but liking it.
*  Liking it. Crazy.
*  I like things by mistake sometimes because I have fat thumbs. I just say the wrong thing.
*  Here's another one. To this day, this is still the most, in all caps, big dick energy
*  I've ever seen in a video. I don't know what that is.
*  There's the guy that like called his dad when he was about to win,
*  who wants to be a millionaire to like celebrate that. I know the answer. I'm going to win.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  So he called his dad, tell his dad that he's going to win because he knew he was going to win.
*  Now look at this flag reason, language, bigotry, sexism.
*  What's the bigotry and the sexism there?
*  I don't understand it. I don't see any bigotry.
*  Bigotry in particular, sexism, that he's a man and he's showing big dick energy because he's...
*  Big dick energy is an expression and it's an expression for someone who is super confident
*  and the idea that you say, well, he must have a big dick. That's the joke about that.
*  But that's not sexist.
*  No, it's a joke. It's an internet meme. Big dick energy is an internet meme.
*  And that this is flag type, bad. Language, bigotry, sexism.
*  Here's the best part, post type liked. He just liked it. Like you saw, I was like, ah,
*  because it is a big dick energy move.
*  What, to phone your dad?
*  Call your dad and say, I'm about to win a million, dad.
*  Does that classify as big dick energy?
*  It's not a phrase that we commonly use in the UK. We're too refined for that.
*  That's vulgar.
*  Yeah, it's vulgar. But it's a new American thing over the last, wait, four years or so?
*  Yeah, even like two maybe.
*  Two years.
*  It's having a big dick sexist then. Is that the...
*  I guess that's what they're saying. And bigotry is the hilarious part.
*  You can scour that motherfucker forever and try to find some bigotry there.
*  You know what?
*  The gentleman's name, if you want to read this, folks, you want to read along with his
*  internet name is K-M-L-E-F-R-A-N-C. K-M-L-E-F-R-A-N-C.
*  Say K-M-L-E-F-R-A-N-C on Twitter. Bruce Almighty. Hilarious. So he's a funny guy.
*  By the way, they don't know what bigotry means. I'm really sick of this word being thrown around.
*  Well, that's a real problem right there. I mean, he should be able to sue for that one.
*  There's nothing bigotry about that.
*  Well, bigotry is... The dictionary definition of bigotry is an intolerance to those with
*  different opinions. And more often than not, sorry, I didn't mean to be patronizing, but
*  it's just that whenever I hear the word being used, it's always by bigots who can't tolerate
*  your opinion. It's like you're a bigot. You don't agree with everything I say and therefore
*  you're a bigot. You just undermine your whole fucking point.
*  Yes. It's gross.
*  But liking tweets. I mean, it's bad enough that people sort of trawl through everything
*  you ever wrote.
*  But liking.
*  But liking them.
*  And what's crazy about that is this is a company that's doing this. So there's a company that they
*  hired that's willing to do this and the company labeled it bigotry. So is the company woke? Is
*  this the company? Fama. The smartest way to screen toxic workplace behavior.
*  No, they'll be...
*  Fama is a talent screening software. Okay, so it's software. That's part of the problem.
*  To help identify problematic behavior among potential hires and current employees by
*  analyzing publicly available online information. Boy, would I have a hard time getting a job.
*  This tweet I just looked up said that another company used this company to get that information.
*  So it's like a background check.
*  Yeah, a company that he was...
*  What a creepy company.
*  Insane.
*  Like that's really sinister.
*  Well, it seems like it's just software. It's just like, yeah, it says talent screening software.
*  So it's basically they just scan you to make sure that you pass their purity test,
*  which no one will. No one with any sense of humor. I mean, if that guy, the big dick energy guy,
*  that gets you flagged, you're a bad person because you thought that that guy who knew
*  he was going to win a million dollars, so he called his dad. I mean, that's funny.
*  That's all that is.
*  Is there anyone... There is no way that there's anyone on the planet who couldn't be canceled
*  if you had unlimited access to their private...
*  No way.
*  Texts and tweets and like...
*  But that's part of why people want to cancel people because they know it could come back at them
*  and there's a certain thrill. Like one of the things that you find about people,
*  like here's one, right? Whenever you see a homophobic preacher, almost guarantee that guy's gay.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Almost guarantee. You know, these sinners and their homosexuality getting together and laying
*  with men and you could see the boner just developing in their pants. That's what these people...
*  I love that. And then they always get caught with a rent boy doing crystal meth or something like
*  that. People who just have just a little... Even if you're adhering to this woke ideology
*  and you're part of the cult, if you just have a few fucked up sketchy things in your past,
*  they could get you. And so you just stay on the offensive. Stay on the offensive.
*  But then that's the same with male... Anyone who identifies as male feminist.
*  100%.
*  And the number of times they... They're a wandering hand predator.
*  Anybody who identifies as a male feminist should be flagged.
*  They should flag them and then just go through their stuff. Like why?
*  So you see it as strategic. You see it as like... I've got cover.
*  100%. I know guys who are creepers who identify as male feminists so that they could get women
*  to think that they're woke and they're a part of the good squad and good guys. It's just...
*  It's a transparent ploy by sneaky men to try to fuck. That's all it is. It's the most obvious...
*  It's like the dumbest magic trick ever. Like you could see them stuff the handkerchief into
*  their sleeve. It's so stupid.
*  But feminists used to just mean someone who believes in equality of the sexes,
*  which is pretty much everyone, right? So it's...
*  Yeah, but that's a problem in the word, right? The word has feminine in it. You should be
*  an egalitarian. You should be an overall open-minded person who believes in the individual and you
*  don't want to separate anyone, whether it's by race or gender or sexual orientation or anything
*  into any groups. You love people and you want everyone to have equal opportunity. You want
*  everybody to have equal treatment.
*  So you would get rid of the word feminist. Do you think...
*  No, I would never get rid of it because I think it's empowering for some people that have grown
*  up in suppressive environments and to be able to establish yourself as someone who's resisting
*  something that you fought against. Like if you grew up in a horrible environment, like maybe your
*  dad beat your mom and you were told you're a piece of shit because you're a woman and then you finally
*  get in with this group that tells you, no, as a feminist, you're empowered. You're a powerful
*  woman and I don't want to get rid of any labels.
*  But I would be on board with that totally if I thought that modern-day feminism was anything to
*  do with empowerment. I don't think it is. I think it's to do with women are weak, women are victims,
*  women need special protection. I think it's the opposite of empowerment in a lot of feminist
*  views.
*  In a lot of feminist views. I try not to generalize in that regard, but my issue is with men, they call
*  themselves feminists. I just don't buy it. I've never met one. Every one I've met is a creeper,
*  either a creeper or the most ultimate beta male.
*  Well, most women don't even identify as feminists.
*  Most women don't. But the men that I have met, they're so obviously compromised.
*  Or it's men that have these really powerful women. That's a lot of it. It's men who have this
*  really powerful girlfriend and they're kind of weak. There's a lot of that.
*  I have a joke. Show me a man who claims to be a feminist who can pick up heavy shit and run fast.
*  They don't exist.
*  Right. Okay. I'll try and prove you wrong on that. I'll try and think I can find some.
*  Well, it's probably a guy who really likes to fuck.
*  He can fuck in a regular way, but he's trying to cover all the bases. He says,
*  you know what? I'm going to be a fucking feminist too, bro. Get them all.
*  This all does make sense to me. But again, I try not to imagine what's going on in people's heads.
*  But you're right. So many of them, it just happens all the time. So many of them,
*  like you say with the gay preachers, it's just so common.
*  Gay preachers are classic. Why would you care?
*  Why would you care? Why are you so angry about gay people? Why do you care?
*  Also, some of them are really camp and effeminate. And you just think, okay,
*  I know what's going on.
*  Clearly. I had a bit about it that there's only two types of people that hate gay marriage.
*  Either you're dumb or you're secretly worried that dicks are delicious.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  And that's what you get from those people. You get this weird thing where you're trying to throw
*  people off the trail. But the people are like, huh? It's like if you show up at a hit and run
*  car accident and you're like, wow, who did this? This is crazy. I would never do this.
*  I can't even believe someone would do this. I mean, I'll tell you what,
*  I would never do it. If you're looking for people, it wouldn't be me.
*  It's like the criminal joining the vigilante gang. It's an old trick. Absolutely.
*  Well, cops always say that when someone's an arsonist, they're almost always at the
*  scene of the crime. They always show up to watch their handiwork.
*  Well, I'm going to think about this more then because I mean, you're sort of putting into my
*  mind now this idea that there's a lot of the woke people are doing it in order to cover their own
*  tracks and like a self-preservation kind of thing.
*  There's definitely that. But I think it's also, they don't want any of that smoke. They don't
*  want any of it coming. They see how vicious it is. They see how horrible it is. Like,
*  yes, like I'm friends with a guy who used to be woke and now he's not.
*  His name is Jamie Kilstein and he's still got fucking called out, man. They went after him.
*  That'll do it. Oh my God. And in a small way, you know, in comparison to the way some people
*  have gotten it, but he recognized like how crazy it is. And he also recognized that his own patterns
*  were so problematic. Like he was tweeting mean things to people and calling them a sexist pig
*  and a piece of shit and homophobic. And he was doing it to get that love. And then he would check
*  his Twitter like obsessively. Like couldn't even, he was walking down the street, kept pulling his
*  phone out of his pocket, see how people are responding to his tweet. And it becomes an addiction
*  in this crazy. Oh, it does. People have that thing where they feel the vibration in their pocket and
*  there is no vibration. It's like, it's like, it's not even vibrating. It's like there's a term for
*  this. So it's like, I took all of my social media apps and this was hugely beneficial. And I put
*  them all on the back page of my phone and I put them in a, a folder that says addict. Right. To
*  remind yourself of your sin. So if I want to fuck around, I want to go on Twitter or Facebook or
*  Instagram. I don't really go on Facebook, but if I want to go on one of those, I have to go into the
*  addict folder. Yeah. And remind yourself. Yeah. So I don't go in that. I mean, I'm getting better at
*  it, but it does bring out the worst in people. And it brings out the worst in me. Like I find the same
*  thing as well. We're human beings, you know, and you can't, I wanted the extent to which social
*  media has sort of escalated everything in the real world as well, you know, because, because we
*  haven't got adults discussing stuff anymore. We've got children throwing mud, you know, that's what's
*  basically happening. Well, you and I are discussing things. It's just, it's harder to find someone who
*  could just sit down and talk to you, but there's a bunch of people that are waking up to it. Yeah.
*  There's a lot of people that are getting flip phones too. Yeah. There's a lot of people that
*  are realizing like, this is a, this is a bad addiction. Yeah. No, I can see that. I've
*  considered getting a flip phone or maybe a phone with no apps on it at all. You know, that's not
*  a bad idea too. Well, I deleted Twitter for a week and then I got so much work done. I was so
*  productive. It was really great. You get a lot done, man. You know, but it's just, I get trapped
*  in those cycles of stupid conversations where someone's arguing with a figment of their
*  imagination. They've sort of decided that you believe something that you just don't believe,
*  and they're telling you what you believe. And you're like, well, you have the luxury of a
*  character as well. Yeah. Well, I used to before I was outed. When did you get outed? That was when
*  the book came. That was March last year and I was gutted. I didn't do it right. How did you?
*  It was the Sunday Times in London. Oh, you know what? So the journalist had done this really
*  interesting investigative journalism stuff like Rosamund Erwin, her name was, and she'd read loads
*  of my political articles because I write these articles for Spike magazine. And she'd read an
*  advanced copy of the book and she'd seen that some of the quotations match up. And then she
*  emailed me saying, I think you're Titania McGrath. Can you, can you confirm or deny this? And I fudged
*  it. You know, I emailed back, I didn't lie, but I sort of fudged it. She phoned friends of mine
*  to ask whether it was me. She, and I hadn't told anyone. Did they rat you out? I hadn't told them.
*  In fact, what was great is some of my friends were following Titania and they didn't know it was me.
*  What was a bit bad was there were a couple of times when I slagged them off as a joke and they
*  didn't know it was me. Anyway, it's funny. Oh, that's hilarious. But I preferred that. I loved being
*  in the closet, you know? And well, have you thought about creating a new character? I've got a couple,
*  but I'm not saying who they are. Bro, they're already looking now. I'm not saying who they are.
*  And they haven't got many followers, but hopefully I can build them up. But like, there was a real,
*  it was like, I loved just being a character. And then the thing is, because the outing happened
*  the week of the book, it looked deliberate. It looked like I'd sort of cynically done it. Well,
*  it was a big publicity thing. Right. But it helped book sales. Yeah, I know. But I didn't,
*  I still didn't want to because now, you know what the big difference is now is that everyone who hates
*  it, and by the way, like the social justice activists, their venom for this character is
*  off the fucking scale. I don't expect them to find it funny. I get that they're not going to find it
*  funny, right? But the anger is just unbelievable. So now it goes to me, right? So now whenever she
*  tweets something that they find offensive, they go for me on. Do they call you by name?
*  Yeah. Or they reply with my name, you know, and I get screenshots sent back at me saying this is
*  homophobic or whatever. And I'm like, none of it is none of it is I, the target is never minorities
*  with her. The target is her. There's no, the goal posts have been moved so far away from reality
*  that there's no logic to any of it. No, you know, someone called me homophobic because I said, I had
*  an old tweet, this from 2012, right? They dug up a bunch of tweets about me this week. Okay.
*  And one of them from 2012 said, call me romantic, but I love it when I see gay couples
*  that are so comfortable that they can kiss in public. I saw this. Yes. And then someone said
*  that you were fetishizing gay people by come on. That's hilarious. That was a, that was a legitimate
*  tweet. I was probably high. I saw it because that's when I feel like warm and fuzzy. And I saw a gay
*  couple make out. I think that was what it was. I mean, it was eight fucking years ago. It's hard
*  to remember, but that's quite sweet. So you may as well have written fucking fags. You may as well
*  might as well. But I was legitimately, you know, you know, it's, it's weird, man. It's weird. The
*  whole thing is very weird, but they could just call you homophobic for that. It's just so well,
*  that's the other thing we could do is like, is well, I hate using the phrase call out, but how
*  about we start calling out people who misuse those words, right? If you're homophobic, you hate gay
*  people. Yeah, it's not, you don't like, you think it's nice that they can kiss openly in public.
*  It says there's no logic to it, but that's the thing. It's like you're arguing with someone
*  who's there. It's like the idea that if you leave Islam, if you, you could be killed, right? Right.
*  This is what happens to an apostate. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That is crazy. Yeah. Right. If you leave,
*  it's so terrifying that someone can kill you, but that is the same kind of religious thinking,
*  religious crazed ideology, adherence to the dogma. Yeah. No matter what that would allow someone to
*  think that I could be homophobic by saying that I think it's great when gay guys are so comfortable
*  they kiss in public. It's because they know you are in your mind. They do this incredible mind
*  reading thing. That's what it's all about. They're all psychics. Did you know that? They're all
*  psychics. They don't care about reality. They don't care about what's true. Exactly. There's
*  no need for reality in their world. If they've decided that you're a bigot, then they can use
*  anything and everything against you, including pro gay tweets. Yeah. They can use it. Exactly.
*  Let's think about they can use a pro gay tweet to prove that you're homophobic. It's amazing,
*  but it's kind of good because it's so crazy that logical left-leaning people read that and they
*  go, what the fuck? They do. And they go, come on, man. And it's been positive for me in a lot of
*  ways that they're so over the top that, like if I have gay friends, they go, dude, I know you're
*  homophobic. I'm like, I didn't know either. Amazing. Now I know. But they know. Maybe this is why they
*  always turn most severely on people from the left who question this stuff. They really do because
*  they expect it from the right. I think too, yeah, especially if you look like you should be on the
*  right and you're on the left, which I definitely do. Right. You know, it's like there's, I mean,
*  you could try to figure it out, but I think it all boils down to adherence, adherence, strict
*  adherence and compliance to the dogma. And if you don't, if you're not willing to comply 100% with
*  the ideology, they'll attack you. So just like Martina Navratolova. But that's why I think left
*  and right is no longer helpful. I think, I think it's about, that's why there are all these weird
*  alliances going on now. I mean, I did this event recently with Peter Boghossian, who I know you've
*  spoken to, and James Lindsay. And we were given these talks at this event in London, and we were
*  sitting there at lunch and there was like the head of the atheist society sitting next to this
*  evangelical Christian pastor from America. And there was like, there were people of no faith and
*  all faith and left and right. And it's like, but we all believe in liberty. Like ultimately we all
*  care about freedom and individual freedom. And that's the new fault line. It's not left against
*  right. It's people who believe in liberty for the individual or people who want more authority to
*  control you. And that's, that's the real conflict. Well, if the right really wanted to bring more
*  people over, what they would do is establish like universally across the board, an appreciation for
*  gay people, appreciation for gay marriage, an appreciation for the need to take impoverished
*  communities and bring them up. Yeah. An appreciation for welfare and appreciation for, you know,
*  raising the minimum wage. If they just started a few things like that, good Lord, the amount of
*  people that would jump off that fucking ship, that sinking ship of liberal ideas, because it's just,
*  it's infested with rats. It's infested with rats that are chewing a hole in the very hull of the
*  ship. That happened in the UK. It was the conservative government that pushed through gay marriage.
*  Cause actually, cause actually it's quite conservative idea. Yes. You know, get government
*  out of your life. Yeah. Yeah. It should be. Well, maybe that's what they, maybe that's what they
*  need to do. But I think what definitely, if you, if you support the left, you need to try and dissuade
*  the Democrats and the, and the labor party from going woke because they alienate all of their
*  major. They do. And they don't even realize they're doing it. But the problem is in this country,
*  there's no room for a third party. Right. People don't appreciate it or believe in it.
*  No, you don't have, you don't have that option, do you? Maybe they kind of do like Gary Johnson
*  ran last year and some people voted for him. But what's really happened in this country
*  previously, historically is that when someone charismatic came along, that's an independent,
*  they really just take votes away from the Democrats. Yeah. So you split the vote, right?
*  Yeah. So the Republicans are pretty rigid. Well, actually here's a example against that though,
*  is Ross Perot. He actually took votes away from the Republican and that's why Bill Clinton got
*  in office. Bill Clinton actually won when Herbert Walker Bush was in his first term. So he only did
*  one term and then Bill Clinton won in when Herbert Walker Bush was going for reelection.
*  And the reason why he won is because Ross Perot, who is this eccentric billionaire,
*  do you remember him? No, I remember Ross Perot. Yeah. He was an eccentric billionaire.
*  Independently. Yes. Independent. And he got on TV and bought an entire half hour of prime time
*  television to show people how they're getting fucked by the Federal Reserve and taxes. And he
*  was explaining, I had a pet here, take it over there. So this is what you do. They take it here
*  and they get it. And he was doing all this shit and everybody's like, what the fuck? And I remember
*  everybody was all in the water. I voted for him. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. It's hard to remember.
*  Were you worried about splitting the vote though? Nah, I was fucking 18. I don't know what the fuck
*  was going on. I don't know how old I was. I must have been 21. But am I right in thinking,
*  there isn't that much between the Democrats and the Republicans, is it? I mean, you don't have a
*  real sort of left wing, right wing option. They're pretty similar on a lot of things.
*  It depends on who you're talking to. You know, if there's a giant difference between Ted Cruz
*  and Bernie Sanders, there's a giant difference. There's some, a lot of it is people are concerned
*  with abortion rights. That's a giant one. And people are concerned with a Republican putting
*  someone in the Supreme Court that is going to limit a woman's right to choose. So social issues,
*  that's the way the difference really lies. Those are big ones. And those are also big ones. Those
*  pro-life people, they, you know, they will not vote for someone who's not pro-life. And so if you
*  get to a position where you are a Republican, you pretty much have to be pro-life. Right. If
*  you want, want the group. So those are the sticking points. Yeah. Because they, they, you know,
*  and this is, there's no judgment here, but this is their, their position is that you're killing a
*  baby. Yeah. Right. And they're like, I don't give a fuck about anything else. You can't kill a goddamn
*  baby. Right. And so they're like, okay, okay, okay. And so many Republicans that maybe even have had
*  abortions themselves, they can't be open about that. They can't be open. Okay. I get it. They
*  have to hide it. This is why I think someone like Sanders is a genuine left-wing option and
*  why someone like Elizabeth Warren or someone who's pushing the woke thing will never be,
*  that will be like electoral hemlock. I think it will just absolutely not work. But see,
*  is they don't see that. How do they not see it? Because they're full of shit. But how do they not
*  see it happen? Like Hillary Clinton was targeting all the various demographics and she's like,
*  she was splitting the electorate up and so I'll say, and it didn't work. Well, how can they not
*  see that this never works? Have you ever known someone who's just a real liar, like pathological
*  liar? They make up a past, they make up things. They don't know that other people can't tell
*  or that other people can tell rather that they're not normal. They're not acting normal. They don't
*  seem genuine. Okay. There's certain aspects of people that it's hard to tell, but there's
*  some people just don't seem genuine and political people in particular, like when people are running
*  for political office, that's when that shit really stands out. Yeah. Because over and over and over
*  again, you see them doing these speeches and over and over and over again, you see them talking
*  about things and some people can sense it and some people can't, but they can't tell. When you're a
*  liar, you can't tell other people see you. Right. Because you're lying. Like I know a guy, I'm going
*  to be nice here. Not name names. No, never. He's gay as fuck, but he doesn't think everybody knows it.
*  He's flamboyant, right? He's gay. Everyone that I know knows he's gay. And there's, and we all
*  wish, you know, but he's got a family. He's got like a wife and kids and we're all speculating
*  like, how's this guy get his rocks off? It's crazy. But it's just one of those things. Like the man
*  is a homosexual. I'm pretty sure. I mean, if I had a bet, I'm fucking pushing all my chips. Right.
*  Okay. Yeah. Right. And because of that, he acts in this really strange because he's living this kind
*  of lie of a life. He acts in a strange way. And I don't think he realizes that people know. And
*  you think a lot of these people go into politics, a lot of these sorts, they're kind of sociopathic.
*  Yeah. There's something about them. And so they have this fake earnestness to them. Right. And
*  that fake earnestness will work. It will work if you're talking to 10,000 people, if you're talking
*  to 10,000 people about the way we can come together as a country and we can take America back. Yeah.
*  There's no connection. But I always put that down to them having to follow a party line or
*  they're sloganizing. They're throwing slogans out there. There's a little of that. I expect
*  to kind of, this is why I'd never be a politician. I couldn't bear not to just say what I think.
*  You can't be a politician. No. For sure. Not after that. No. The thing is when someone's trying to be
*  woke, what they're doing is they're just, it has nothing to do with being genuine. If someone's a
*  woke politician, unless that's who they really are. I think a lot of them are though. I mean,
*  like AOC I think she really is. Yeah. AOC, Ellen Omar and Rashida Tlaib. I think they mean what
*  they say. AOC is also, she's not even 30. She's a 29 year old woman. She's idealistic and she's got
*  these thoughts of the future and she's a democratic socialist. There was an article in the Spectator
*  this week about this. There aren't really woke people. They're just sort of acting this out.
*  I wish that were true, but I don't think it is. I don't think it is. And I think Trump's being very
*  smart whenever he sort of brings people like Ellen Omar into the limelight of focuses on AOC
*  and focus on them. Cause it means that you start thinking Democrat is woke. Yes. You know,
*  it sends that sort of message. And we know it just never, it never works. And that's why I
*  despair with the Labour Party and the way the Labour Party went. I want to see a proper opposition.
*  I want to see a proper left wing party that cares about class issues, that cares about money, that
*  cares about the poverty line, social mobility, you know, not, you know, whether you're whatever,
*  yeah, compassion, compassion for people that are trying to get by in this life, not social
*  justice issues. Not nonsense. Yeah, exactly. And that's the way most people feel that really is.
*  But I think it's also, we, this is a symptom of a very simple, not, not simple, excuse me,
*  a society where it's pretty easy to get by. Yeah. There's, it's not, we're not dealing with World
*  War II. Right. Okay. It would be impossible to be woke if we were being invaded by the Nazis. Of
*  course. These, these, these would not be priorities whatsoever. No, exactly. But it would never take
*  hold. It takes hold in this incredibly safe environment. If you know, you know, like Pinker's
*  work, which shows the progression of society becoming safer and safer. Do you know the
*  resistance that he gets to these ideas? Yeah. Where people call him some sort of a piece of
*  shit and an enabler and horrible things they say to him for just talking about science and statistics
*  and showing the trends that we live in, probably one of the greatest times to be alive ever. Yeah.
*  But that's also why people are finding things to complain about, finding things that are issues,
*  finding things to rally for, finding things, these causes. I mean, I think the way that people
*  speak at the moment is that the UK and the US at the moment are the most bigoted, racist,
*  homophobic societies they've ever been. And then they're the opposite of that. They're the most
*  tolerant they've ever been. And what's weird about that is the statistics bear it out. Yes. So all of
*  the, all of the studies show that the UK, Great Britain is the most tolerant major European country.
*  Even the EU's own research into this shows that the tolerance towards immigration, for instance,
*  in the UK has become so much more improved since the Brexit vote. So we are up there, you know,
*  with, and yet, and for some reason, as things get better and better and better, and society gets more
*  progressive and more tolerant, claims of bigotry and racism get more and more escalated. And they,
*  and that's, that's, that is, I think, something we could challenge. Like firstly, let's get the left
*  to be left again and fuck all the woke nonsense, but also remind people that they're not oppressed
*  when they say they are. Like if someone claims to be oppressed, that's a very specific extreme thing.
*  It's not just, well, I sense there's some unconscious bias in the world or, or maybe that
*  actor should have been a different color or something like oppression is something very
*  different. Someone's, someone's asking you for your papers when you're turning every corner.
*  Someone's not letting you, you know, a proper oppression is what dictators do is what tyrants
*  do. It's what they do in North Korea where you fuck up, they'll, they'll arrest your whole family
*  and put your whole family in prison. And ironically, leaning towards wokeness actually starts to create
*  oppression. Like you see that guy who got his fucking Twitter check for liking funny memes.
*  So how is it the case that those sort of tactics, I'm not saying that they,
*  that that's an authoritarian company, but those tactics are straight from the authoritarian paper.
*  100%. 100%.
*  So it, how is it that they can't see the hypocrisy of that, that they can't see that what this is
*  where this is leading? I think they probably had no idea it was going to be that extreme when they
*  first implemented it and they just wanted to keep problematic people out of their office.
*  If you're a person who is like, say if you're hiring someone and you find out, you know,
*  a few weeks after they're on the job that they have, you know, some really horrific posts on
*  Twitter and people have found that before. I remember there was a story, there was a man who
*  got outed and he had a Reddit account and his Reddit account was horrific. Okay. So, but this is,
*  you're talking about genuine sort of nasty kind of neo-Nazi horrible. I don't know if it was neo-Nazi.
*  I think it was like pedophilia. Okay. Talking about pedophilia. It was a lot of it was joking
*  around and stuff, but he was just responsible for awful shit. And so the internet people like,
*  fuck this guy, let's find out who the fuck he is. So they found out who he is and then they let his
*  boss know and they sent copies of all the shit that he had written on Reddit and he got fired for it.
*  Right. That's, but that's different. But these sorts of initiatives that are set up,
*  you can't trust them to make those important distinctions between something that is very
*  serious and something that could obviously end up with all sorts of issues. Yeah. But if you're an
*  employer, the last thing you want is one of those guys slipping through your radar where you don't
*  know that this guy's working for you. That's true. Okay. But I still get really uncomfortable with
*  the idea of trawling through everyone's history. I do as well because also a lot of these people
*  that are saying these things, they do it for sport. Yeah. They don't really mean that. They're not
*  really Nazis. Like there's a lot of people that do that Pepe the frog meme. Yeah. Same thing. They
*  do it because it makes other people feel uncomfortable. So they think it's funny.
*  So it feels bad, man. He's a Nazi. I only realized this properly when I did meet that Count Dankula
*  guy because he showed me the discord serve, you know, the chat room they all go into. And it was,
*  I was like, Oh, I can't deal with this stuff. Like some of the stuff that was in there, I was like,
*  I can't, but what I, what I could clearly see is it's, it's like big kids. It's like big teenagers.
*  They're just one upmanship. They're just trying to outgrow each other. Right. Exactly. And so
*  it's like, do you know the Kekistan flag? Yes. So the Kekistan flag, which is a satire of, of
*  identity policy, a nation of identitarians, you know, and then they modeled it on the Nazi flag
*  to take the piss. Right. But of course, if you don't know that world and you're not from that
*  one, you see that flag, you think, Oh my God, that's a Nazi flag. They're just copying it.
*  Yes. And so if you don't know, if you don't immerse yourself in that world, like I'm from an,
*  I'm an outsider from an outsider's perspective, it took someone to show me for me to sort of get
*  it. Jordan had to show it to me. Oh, did he? Jordan had to explain the whole thing to me.
*  And, you know, and Jordan has taken so much heat because he posed for a photograph with these guys
*  that had him hold up the flag of Kekistan. And he thought it was funny because he thinks that these
*  sort of these memes, that it's, it's, he's, he's interested in the fact that people interpret them
*  so severely. Yes. And so extremely. Well, they jumped to the worst possible interpretation.
*  They assume the worst of everyone. Well, it's because of the small percentage
*  are actually Nazi frogs. That's what I was going to say is that the counter argument to that is,
*  well, couldn't genuine fascists use this as cover? That's the, that's the counter argument
*  that people use. So, so, um, one thing that Dankler told me is that what happens is they'll spot
*  these new actual neo-Nazis coming into the server and they'll get, you know, they'll deal with them.
*  You know, they sort them out themselves. They've got a way of sort of discerning it,
*  but that's the typical argument. Yeah. That, that, that humor and-
*  Well, that's a great way also, if you wanted to break up a group, you infiltrate and act like a
*  Nazi with that Kekistan flag. And then all of a sudden everyone's a Nazi who's associated with
*  that frog. Yeah. I mean, that, that is a, that's a classic government move.
*  I think it's, I think it's incumbent on people to try and understand the culture that they're
*  criticizing, you know? Yes. Like my friend, Steven Knight, who does, he, he, he's an interviewer and
*  he went and interviewed a bunch of people on a march with the Kekistan flag and was asking them
*  about their views and whether they're racist. And when he spoke to them, it was quite clear
*  that they just don't, they're part of this internet culture and they think it's funny
*  and they think it's trolling and all of that sort of stuff. And, and once you realize that,
*  if you have a generous interpretation of that, then, then you understand that this isn't,
*  this isn't this horrible right, but, but, but people use this as evidence of this rising
*  fascism. They use, they use people joking about fascism as evidence of the rise in fascism. Those
*  two things just don't, and why would you, why would you want to live in a world where there are
*  fascists? Why would you want to believe that? I don't understand that. Like the people who
*  proclaim to be anti-racist, I've never seen anyone more excited to find racism. They're the, they love
*  racism. They can't wait to find it under every stone in every corner. Well, that's how they justify
*  their actions, right? So it just goes back to that thing, gives them purpose, gives them something to
*  do. Well, it's also like we were talking about with woke people that they can't, you can't be
*  woke enough because once they found all the other people that aren't following the doctrine,
*  then they turn on each other. They will. Absolutely. No one's gone through my tweets yet. And no one,
*  as far as I'm aware, I'm putting this out there now, but no one's done that to me yet. And so,
*  and I'm like, what did I say? Now I'm getting myself, is there jokes? There must be. Of course. I
*  mean, I've been on Twitter since 2007. I've said so much stupid shit and I used to use it differently
*  too. I used to use Twitter. Like I would post things that I thought people would react to
*  in a silly way and I would just retweet things and not even say anything. Like let's, let's see how
*  these people freak out about this. You should get someone to go back over your own. They can have it.
*  Really? Yeah. That's the best attitude to not care. Good luck. Exactly. Go waste your life going
*  through my tweets. Some people I know, they do this thing where they self-destruct the tweets
*  after seven days, you know, so that, oh really? Yeah. They do that. I did that with Titania for
*  a bit when in the early days she was getting mass reported and I thought like she kept getting banned.
*  Like she'd had four. I like how you talk about her like she's a real person. I do. That's how,
*  that's how I inhabit the role because I have to think of her as something other. Do you think
*  that when you do that, when you inhabit her, do you think that you understand and appreciate the
*  way these people think? And do you think that it's attractive in some way? Yeah. I know about it
*  because I used to study this stuff. So I used to teach and I used to, I did a thesis which was
*  about post-structuralism and post-modalism, a lot about Foucault and all the origins of this stuff.
*  So I'm familiar with it and I'm familiar with the language and I'm familiar with the ideas.
*  And of course all of my friends have always been on the left. So I know this, I know what this is
*  all about. And it's fun to try to think in the way that they think. And because that's how I come up
*  with the jokes is I think is what's the most extreme way I could take this obvious thought?
*  How can I push it as far as using their mindset, not my mindset? Right. And that's, it's kind of a
*  fun thing to do. It's kind of interesting. I would imagine it'd be very fun. I find people that believe
*  what they believe very strongly to be extremely attractive. Yeah. And attractive, I don't mean
*  like I'm sexually attracted to them. I mean attractive like, hmm, like this is weird. Like
*  I watch a lot of fundamentalist religious videos. Yeah. Because I really get fascinated
*  by people that are all in. I totally agree. I love watching those Westbrook Baptist Church
*  music videos. They're hilarious. They're really funny. They're like, it's, I watch that and I
*  think, God, you believe this stuff. I mean, like this is crazy to an extreme extent, but they,
*  again, they're sincere. They are sincere. But I like it with all religions. I've watched it
*  with multiple different religions, with Islam and Christianity and Mormonism. I've watched a lot of
*  videos where people really, really, really believe. And then the other people really believe too. And
*  there's something attractive about that. And I think it's, and I've watched it to try to understand
*  it. Right. Because my parents are, my stepdad and my mom were basically atheists. I was raised by
*  atheists. And before that I was Catholic. So I was Catholic till I was like first grade. And then from
*  then on, you know, when my mom married my stepdad, it was all, no, there was no religion in the
*  household. Right. And so I've always been kind of fascinated by people that have this intense
*  belief in something. Yeah. And particularly something that's really not logical. Like if you
*  laid the tenants out, like, wait a minute, he came back to life? Okay. And turned water into wine?
*  That's the nature of, I mean, I come from a Catholic family as well, you know, and I think
*  my mother was a postulant nun. So it's a very, yeah, Irish as well. So it's pretty heavy. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I recently see all pictures of her in the habit. You know, it's a scary thing to see.
*  But yeah, I mean, the belief that you have, the faith that you have is irrational by its own
*  definition. But that's not a threat if you have that genuine part of the joy of faith, I think,
*  is that you are believing it in spite of rational thought. Right. Yeah. The joy of
*  believing in something that you, and I think there's something about that where you like the fact
*  that other people also aren't questioning it. Right. Like when you see people at church,
*  one of the things they like, I believe this, is that they like the fact that you're not
*  questioning it either. Good Lord is going to look after us, Sam. Yes, he is, Tom. And they like this
*  sort of simple, really in the box kind of thinking from you, because if I know that you think like
*  that, I can kind of predict how you're going to at least behave most of the time. And don't we all
*  it's much more fun, isn't it, to read someone who agrees with you than someone who's challenging
*  you? Because challenging takes its effort, right? Yeah, it's exhausting. But I think what you've
*  identified there applies to all ideologies, whether it's political or religious. You know,
*  I think I've noticed this with ideologues is that when I talk to someone who, say someone says
*  something really woke, say someone says, like, I think the movie Dunkirk should have had more
*  people of colour, which was a common criticism at the time. Once they've said something that's that
*  woke, I then know every other opinion they have on everything else. They never surprise me,
*  because they've got a series of things that they believe. And that's the same with the religious
*  person. Someone says, I'm a Catholic. Well, I know what you believe about transubstantiation or
*  whatever, you know, and that means that you're not thinking for yourself then. Yeah, they have this
*  predetermined pattern of behaviour. Yeah, which is why ideology scares me full stop, which is why I
*  don't mind saying conservatives are right about some things, left-wingers are right about other
*  things and having the discussion and accepting that I'm probably wrong about an awful lot of
*  stuff as well. Like, that to me is better than saying I know all the answers as, like, a Marxist
*  would or a woke person would or a Catholic would or whatever. What we need to do is create an
*  ideology of open-mindedness. But that wouldn't be an ideology, right? Of course it wouldn't be. But
*  they always say that, so the anti-woke thing they'll say is an ideology in and of itself.
*  To be open, that's like saying that atheism is a religion. It's not the same thing.
*  Well, some atheists do act like religious people though.
*  Give me an example of that.
*  Well, they absolutely know for sure that nothing happens to you when you die.
*  And like, well, you don't know that.
*  But the burden of proof is on those who claim that it does, surely? Like,
*  because they're the ones making the claim.
*  Yes. If you want to say that you know for sure that you go to heaven and you
*  ride around the clouds and St. Peter's there with a book and there's a harp and God's there,
*  yes, the burden of proof is on you. But if you want to say that absolutely nothing happens to
*  you when you die, you're sure. I say, okay, have you died? You never died. So how do you know?
*  You don't. Well, you've got to say you don't know. Because as soon as you say you know something that
*  I know you can't know, then I know you're bullshitting. And you might be bullshitting
*  about something that is logical, like atheism, right? It's logical that there probably isn't a
*  guy in the clouds with a harp because it doesn't seem to make much sense. But you don't know what
*  the fuck happens when you die. That is a fair point. And Richard Dawkins addressed that point
*  in his book, The God Delusion, because he says he is actually a de facto atheist. Insofar as there's
*  a room for agnosticism there, like 0.001%, he will acknowledge the possibility that there might be an
*  afterlife or something. He's also never done psychedelic drugs. And I talked to him about that.
*  Has he not? No. He's worried about it. Yeah. And I'm like, come on, bro, you're dying.
*  He's worried about the impact of it. Well, he's worried about the effect on his body.
*  And I'm like, listen, just take a small dose of mushrooms and I guarantee you'll have a very
*  different perspective on reality itself. He'll have visions and he might be sort of lured into
*  the religious. Well, I don't think it'll lure you into religion unless you live in thousands of
*  years ago before science. But it would give you the idea that there is perhaps something available.
*  There's levels of consciousness. There's things available to regular human beings that take in
*  these molecules. And that people have been doing this and this has been the source of religious
*  experiences for thousands and thousands of years. There's books written about it. I'm sure. I mean,
*  I consider myself quite a spiritual person. I think that's fine. That's such a tainted word,
*  though, isn't it? Why? What's wrong with that? Because spiritual is like whenever people say
*  I'm spiritual. That's one of those words that makes me think you're into crystals.
*  No, I'm not into crystals. No, I don't mean it like that.
*  You know what I mean? But in America, spiritual is like, it's sort of tainted by yoga people.
*  Yeah, Wiccan. They say namaste.
*  Okay. You know what I mean?
*  I don't mean that.
*  Nothing wrong with that either. It's people that they go with that.
*  I mean that there's something numinous about humanity and about life and about existence.
*  And I mean that there's something wondrous about it and there's something that
*  is beyond the mere animal.
*  Oh, agreed. Yeah, for sure.
*  That's all I mean by that.
*  Yeah, I think so too. And that's why I'm deeply distrustful of people that are cruel.
*  Yeah, me too. Absolutely. But that's one of the reasons I don't like the woke lot.
*  I think pretty much everything I do is driven by a hatred of bullying. I hate bullying. I hated it
*  when I was a kid. I hated it when I was one. No, I didn't hate it when I was one, but I hated it
*  subsequently when I got bullied. But you know, that thing of like, bullying people is just the
*  most, it's childish. It's the way children behave when they're trying to seek dominance over other
*  people. And anyone who claims that anyone who bullies someone so viciously and claims to be
*  the good guy, I can't bear that. That to me is the most-
*  Yes, I agree. And they feel justified in their bullying, which is fascinating.
*  Well, it's that thing that Steven Weinberg said about, you know, in order for good people to do
*  bad things, it takes a form of religion. And that's, I think, what we see.
*  It's all going back to what we were talking about earlier. These patterns of behavior that we have
*  seen since the beginning of time. So that means we've solved it. I think we can work out. It's
*  about de-radicalizing. It's acknowledging that it's an ideology, but then you're faced with the
*  criticism that you're setting up a new ideology to combat that ideology. So it's about-
*  You probably are.
*  Unless, yeah, okay. Unless you say it's about open-mindedness.
*  I think you have to be very strong to exist without a real, clear ideology. You have to be
*  very strong.
*  Well, you have guiding principles. And there are, I do believe, some universal-
*  But to never submit to dogma, to never submit-
*  That's, you should, well, guard against it. And above all, be willing to listen to people
*  you don't agree with. Above all-
*  You, I think, can do that. The people that would be coerced by the Nazis to join the party,
*  because they got into a chat room. There's a problem there. And I think, you know, I had a
*  joke about people, explaining something to my daughter when she was asking me why people
*  certain, why people believe things. And I say, some people have big ears. Some people have small
*  ears, right? Well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. And that's just how it
*  goes. And there's not much you can do about those folks.
*  So, unless, is that not just a failure of education, you know?
*  It's a little bit of a failure of education. In some instances, it's definitely that. But in some
*  instances, some people are dull. They're just not very bright.
*  But if we had a society where people were socialized well, you know, because I think being
*  an autonomous adult absolutely depends on being socialized effectively as a child.
*  Yeah. But, you know, there's some people- Have you ever been to a comedy hypnotism show?
*  What? I didn't know that existed.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really, there was a big thing back in Massachusetts.
*  When I started doing stand-up in Boston, there was a guy named Frank Santos. And he was a famous
*  hypnotist, great guy. And Frank was the best. He was a genius at it. And he would get people
*  on stage like, who wants to be hypnotized? And he did a show that was weekly at Stitch's Comedy Club
*  in Boston. Comics, like myself, would all go to watch because it was guaranteed hilarious.
*  So we would go to the comedy club and we would sit in the back and watch Frank Santos bring,
*  he would bring like 10 people on stage and he would hypnotize them in front of everybody.
*  And some people he couldn't hypnotize. And I don't mean hypnotize like sit you down,
*  because I've been hypnotized before, where they sit you down. Like my friend Vinny
*  Shorman, who's a hypnotist who works with fighters and like a mental coach. And he basically gets you
*  into a calm state and starts introducing ideas to you. This is not like that. Frank would do
*  this publicly in front of people and he could get a certain percentage of people to just
*  go with suggestion. And he'd be like, you right now are having sex with Madonna. You're on top
*  of Madonna. You can't even believe it. Oh my God, you're so happy you're going to come in your pants.
*  And he would do that and the guy would go, oh, like they would come in their pants.
*  So they would actually ejaculate.
*  Yes, they would ejaculate. And they didn't know what happened. And then he would go,
*  you're going to go to sleep now. And he would tell them go to sleep and they would just
*  just drop their head. And he would know when they were bullshitting and he would know where
*  they were not pushing. And I had long conversations with him about this. I'm like, how do you do this?
*  And he had been hypnotizing people forever to quit smoking. He was a legitimate hypnotist,
*  but he was like, some people are just really susceptible.
*  Is it partly performative though, in those situations? Is it that some of them are thinking
*  there's an audience there, I better do what I'm told or even on a subconscious level?
*  I would think that, but he knew when they were not under.
*  Okay.
*  Dude, it was crazy. It's crazy to what and it's not you and it's not him and it's not me.
*  There's certain people, the people that would join the cult. There's certain people.
*  So you're talking about suggestible people who are instinctively suggestible, right?
*  Like the hail bop comet cult. Remember that? The heaven's gate cult. They cut their balls off
*  and wore purple Nikes and they waited for the kind and they all killed themselves.
*  Right.
*  When the comet was coming. Do you remember that?
*  Actually, this does ring a bell. Yeah.
*  Who the fuck would do that? Who would do that? People with really dull minds. There's certain
*  people. Look, some people are tall. Some people are short. Some people's brains don't work well.
*  All right. But even I think this is something where we don't agree. Is it because I think
*  ultimately what you do, even if you do identify that, even if you say in society, there are these
*  people who are suggestible and just stupid, let's call it what it is, stupid people.
*  Dull minded, low IQ.
*  They still have every right to live in our society and be treated well and all the rest of it.
*  For sure.
*  And I don't think we should just change all our laws and traditions and the way we do things
*  because some people are going to react like idiots and some people are going to,
*  I just don't think that's-
*  Oh, I know. I'm with you 100%. I'm not saying that we should. I'm just saying it's going to be,
*  always going to be a problem.
*  That's a really good way of approaching it is to acknowledge that it's always going to be a problem
*  because this is often the argument used for censorship, isn't it? It's like if you put out
*  a film that is particularly violent, of course most people aren't going to react to it, but some
*  will. Well, fine. Some will, but those same people could be triggered by absolutely anything.
*  It could be an angry word that a relative said. It could be a news item that they saw.
*  We still have to live in the world as it exists and not try and absolutely coddle everyone and
*  try and prevent any possibility of transgression.
*  I 100% agree with you and I'm on your side, but I'm saying even if you do your best,
*  there's going to be a certain amount of people that are just not going to, the education's not
*  going to sink in. The evaluation of things on an objective level is never going to work.
*  But that's because you're dealing with human beings and that's why when the social justice
*  movement think that they can attain this utopia, they think they can wipe out prejudice. They think
*  that, I think that what you can do is you can try and limit it as much as possible and confront it
*  where it exists. But it is delusional to think that you're going to get rid of malevolence and
*  human fallibility. And oftentimes they suffer from their own prejudice.
*  Did you see the thing with Don Lemon on CNN with those two guys where they started mocking Trump
*  supporters and pretending they're stupid and using a Southern accent and I'm like, you guys,
*  that's going to be a deplorable moment. You're being prejudiced.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And you're pretending it's funny, which is even more offensive as a comedian. You know that shit
*  ain't funny. And Don Lemon's like, and then afterwards, even worse, he says he didn't
*  realize that people were being mocked and he didn't hear all of it.
*  Yeah, he said he was laughing over them speaking or something so he didn't hear the whole thing.
*  He didn't realize that they were saying things that were offensive. I'm sorry. I would never
*  mock anyone.
*  Well, because some forms of prejudice are okay and some aren't okay, right?
*  Exactly.
*  The one I really love about the social justice law, maybe this is just a British thing, but they're
*  all really ageist. They've got a real problem with old people, right?
*  Old white people.
*  Old white people, right? Well, there's that form of prejudice. I think it's because of Brexit,
*  because it's disproportionately older people voting for Brexit. So they're like, oh, I don't
*  care about old people. And in fact, you even have the left leaning papers, like the Guardian
*  and the Independent sort of talking like, well, they're all going to die off soon and then we can
*  have another vote. But that's not how it works. It's not like old people die off and then there
*  are no more old people. People get older, people change their minds. But it was also really toxic.
*  It was this thing of like, you know, they've fucked up the future for the young and they're
*  all, you know, it was really ugly. And for some reason, these people who claim that immutable
*  characteristics must be protected, doesn't matter if you're old, they'll go for you if you're old.
*  Or if you're, like you say, straight white male.
*  Straight white males, they'll fuck themselves.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. But I don't know how you can see that as anything as hypocritical.
*  To make that point.
*  You're logical and you're intelligent and you're objective. Of course you can't,
*  but they're woke, you know? I mean, they might as well be in that Heaven's Gate cult. It's the
*  same thing.
*  Well, I think, I wonder if a lot of it is coming from the media, is coming from the press,
*  is coming from the, we've got, I don't know what it's like. I mean, we saw that article from the
*  New York Times. We've got stuff like that. We've got this paper, The Guardian and the Independent.
*  They are pushing this stuff.
*  Hardcore, it sells.
*  Every single day, you know?
*  There's a lot of hate clicks too.
*  Yeah. Oh, so if, actually, shall I give you this example? Do you know that I trolled the
*  Independent, the newspaper?
*  No.
*  Right. So I wanted to test as an experiment, right? Whether they would publish something
*  really stupidly woke just because it's woke, right? So I submitted an article.
*  Like James Lindsay and...
*  Right, yeah.
*  ...Joseph.
*  Like on a smaller scale, you know, but I thought, I wrote an article arguing that comedians ought
*  to be prosecuted for hate speech, right? Mentioning a few comics, mentioning, and it was so obviously
*  a hoax and so obviously stupid. And I made up a name and I sent it in and they got back to me like,
*  this is brilliant. We love this. This is amazing. They were really loving it and they published it.
*  It's still online. And what's even worse...
*  Wait, how can we find it?
*  Right. It's called, the name is Liam, if you search Liam Evans...
*  Is that your name?
*  Yeah. Liam Evans, Independent. And the headline is something like, it's something to do with comedy.
*  If you search that, it will come up.
*  Hate speech.
*  Hate speech or...
*  How many of these online fake names?
*  So here it is.
*  As a comedy aficionado, I'm appalled at disgusting jokes creeping back into the industry.
*  And look at them underneath. Look at the tagline. Comedians crying free speech isn't good enough.
*  Hate crime laws should apply to all of us. Now, the thing about this article,
*  if you take the fourth letter of every sentence, it spells out,
*  Titania McGrath wrote this, you gullible hacks.
*  And they published it. And it's still up there. And this is a mainstream...
*  Oh my God, that's hilarious.
*  It's a mainstream newspaper. It's one of our major...
*  It's amazing that you were able to encode that.
*  Well, it also shows that they did fuck all editing.
*  They just took it because they loved what it was saying. And of course, the point isn't to try and
*  fool people or be mean to people or anything. It's exposing this thing that the media,
*  if the woke media, if it furthers their agenda, they'll publish anything by someone who wasn't
*  even known. He had no online presence, this guy. It's just they agreed with the sentiment.
*  So they published it in their paper. You just be a random, random person sends it in and they're
*  like, brilliant. Yeah, they just agree.
*  And they put it in a national paper. That was the independent.
*  I can't believe they haven't taken it down yet.
*  They will now. Well, I only sort of revealed it a
*  couple of months ago in this speech I gave. It was the one where I was with Peter and James Lindsay.
*  And it went online, but I suppose not many people know about it, but yeah,
*  they'll probably take it down now. But you know, fuck them because I actually think,
*  raise your standards, you know? Stop feeding us this ideological bullshit.
*  I think there's an issue too with online journalism that these people are basically
*  fighting for their own survival. There's not a lot of money in it. It's hard to get clicks.
*  You have to have clickbait titles. You have to attack people for things.
*  In order to get real engagement, you have to kind of give into a certain amount of madness.
*  Isn't that depressing? That's the same reason why the most extreme ideas on Twitter get
*  more retweets. They get rewarded, don't they, with likes and retweets and everything?
*  It's like the whole, but that shouldn't, I have a real old fashioned view of the media. I want to
*  hold them to high standards and I don't want them to be going for clickbait and saying the most
*  extreme things. I think you're right and I think they do it for that reason, but I just wish they
*  wouldn't. I mean, save that for some, like the Huffington Post doing stuff like Women Are Evil.
*  That was one headline, Women Are Evil and you know, stuff like Buzzfeed does it as well.
*  And you just think, but when it comes to sort of reputable publications like the New York Times
*  and like the Washington Post, why are they pushing this?
*  I think they're struggling.
*  So you think it's just about money?
*  I think that's a viable way to generate clicks and clicks is what generates income. And I think
*  there's a real issue. I know guys who are journalists and women as well, who will tell you
*  that if their articles do not get a certain amount of engagement, they're in trouble.
*  They can't just print things. Everything has to be something that is engaging. It has to be
*  it has to be attractive. Look what Facebook's algorithm does, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, one of the things that Facebook's algorithm does is it's sort of in some way
*  encourages people to be upset about things because it shows you a lot of things that you
*  engage with. And a lot of times people tend to engage with things that they're upset by.
*  So whether it's abortion or second amendment or whatever the subject is,
*  if you have an engagement with that and you respond a lot, that's what they're going to show you over
*  and over and over again. And it's really more of a symptom of what human beings are attracted to.
*  A lot of times we're attracted to things that upset us.
*  But that's going to spiral further and further out of control.
*  I mean, what are you logical?
*  The culture war is being motored is engineered by all of this stuff out there.
*  And that's the argument against Facebook, right? The culture war is being engineered by algorithms.
*  Yeah. And although I'm really torn on this actually, because I'm so against censorship
*  in all its, you know, I really am. But I want, if journalists and commentators had high standards
*  and were just being honest first and foremost, and they had integrity and they weren't just after
*  clicks, then half of this stuff would go away, I feel.
*  Some of it would go away. My question is, they weren't doing this 15 years ago.
*  No.
*  So what will they be doing 15 years from now? Will this wear out? Will this dry up?
*  So that's the question, isn't it? Are we going to reach a tipping point?
*  That's the question.
*  Right. Because every time I think we're nearly at the tipping point,
*  they double down and it gets worse, right? So, you know, after Trump's election, for instance,
*  right, almost immediately you had the women's march. And I didn't really know what that was about.
*  Like it was, some people were marching for feminism, some people marching for environmental issues,
*  some people marched. It was really incoherent. A lot of them were dressed in the pink pussy hats
*  and giant vagina costumes and stuff like that. I thought, but what are you protesting here?
*  Are you saying that you know, and a lot of them had banners saying, not my president, right?
*  So they're protesting against democracy then in that case. The same thing in the UK when
*  we just had our general election, it was a big march with loads of people with banners saying,
*  not my prime minister, Boris Johnson, not my, well, he is your prime minister because we had
*  a democratic mandate and that's how this works, right? So I think, what are you, but seriously,
*  what is the point of that protest? Like-
*  I think they're just showing unity. They're showing that they're all together in their anger
*  about this and that in the future, they're going to be a combined force and they're going to make
*  sure that this doesn't happen again. I think there's a better way to do it without generating
*  so much resentment, right? I think there's a more sophisticated approach, which is to say that
*  democracy is sustained on the principle of the loser's consent. Any democracy is going to have
*  a substantial proportion of the population who did not vote for the leader of that.
*  Sure. And you have to have that. And the best way is through cogent persuasion and sensible
*  discussion and of the issues, not dressing up as a vagina. That's just my view on that.
*  Yeah. No, I agree with you in many ways, but I also think for them is also fun to get together
*  with a bunch of other like-minded people. And then there's the men who joined in,
*  hey girls, I'm with you.
*  Okay. The fun thing I can get on board with, but the marches after Boris Johnson's election
*  weren't about fun. That was an explosion of rage.
*  I didn't see that, but it is weird to me that he looks like Trump.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He looks like your version of Trump.
*  I think he's not the same.
*  He's not the same, but he's got wacky hair and you know, it's like-
*  And he's got that reputation of saying what he thinks and all the rest of it. So there's
*  similarities, but I don't think they're comparable. Boris, I don't support Boris,
*  but he's very smart and he's very-
*  Is he?
*  Yeah, he's a smart guy. And he's, you know, I've never voted for his party.
*  We're ignorant to your country over here.
*  What was his platform?
*  Well, so he's in the Conservative Party.
*  We only pay attention to the Queen and the King.
*  Really?
*  The Prince and whatever Prince is in trouble because he was banging chicks on fuck Island.
*  Oh, Prince Andrew.
*  And then there was the other Prince who's leaving. We pay attention to that shit.
*  You're more interested in the family that they have no power at all in our country.
*  We're a ridiculous nation.
*  I mean, you stole Harry from us, didn't you?
*  Yes, we got him now.
*  You got him back. And you turned him woke. You turned him really woke and then you stole him.
*  Is he woke?
*  Oh my God, Prince Harry.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah. So Meghan Markle is completely-
*  She turned him into a wokester?
*  100%. And bear in mind, he used to be the one who used to go to sort of parties and do drugs and all.
*  I don't know if he did drugs, actually. I should qualify that.
*  She made him woke.
*  But yeah, he's super woke now.
*  Well, it's going to move to Canada. It's a good place to be woke.
*  That's why.
*  But they're also saying that he can't move to Canada because if you're a royal from England,
*  you're not supposed to have a primary residence in Canada.
*  Is that because it's part of the Commonwealth or something?
*  Yes. The idea is like you can't come in there and take over because if you did,
*  he's lost his title now.
*  I know.
*  So all of that stuff.
*  Just get it back. Call his grandma.
*  That says a lot. She was pissed off.
*  Oh my God.
*  And she just said, no, you can't have your title. You've got to pay for your cottage,
*  all that money you took from the taxpayers. You've got to pay for that. It's not a cottage,
*  by the way. It's a big estate, but they call it Frogmore Cottage.
*  But it's funny to me that you guys over here are more interested in some sort of outmoded
*  archaic institution like the Royal Family. So there isn't really an awareness of our political
*  situation or-
*  We know Brexit bad. Brexit bad.
*  But Brexit is not bad.
*  That's all we hear.
*  You hear Brexit bad.
*  Racist.
*  Right. Okay.
*  Brexit bad.
*  But can I say this because I know Brexit probably bores people, but
*  the problem with the whole Brexit thing is people thought it was about race. People thought it was
*  like you voted for the EU if you were a good person and voted against if you're a bad person.
*  Correct.
*  It wasn't that.
*  No?
*  No.
*  We've been lied to?
*  You've been lied to. Most people voted because they wanted the idea. In fact, the polls straight
*  after the vote said that the number one reason why people voted Brexit is they wanted the laws
*  to govern their country to be made within their country, which strikes me as a very reasonable
*  proposition. If you're a Democrat, you want to be able to vote out the people in power.
*  You can't vote out those bureaucrats in Brussels. You can't do it. That's the principle. It's not
*  because we want to go back to some pre-war, nostalgic, all-white country. This is a complete
*  lie and it's just experientially unsound. I mean, I don't meet anyone like that,
*  you know? But that's the way it's been spun.
*  You know, and also, by the way, if you're left-wing and you're supporting the EU,
*  which is this neoliberal trading bloc that is really pro-corporate, ruthlessly so,
*  then I don't know how you can even call yourself left-wing, to be honest.
*  So what is the anger in the streets in England?
*  It's because of the... Well, this goes back to what we were saying about the press.
*  So we had six months of debate on the Brexit issue before people voted. So people really knew what
*  they were voting for. They knew what these issues were about. But the media was constantly spinning
*  and saying, if you vote leave, you're a racist, and if you vote to remain in the EU, you're one
*  of the good guys. That was the narrative they were spinning from the start. And you know what it did?
*  It did that thing of generating resentment. Did anybody step out that's logical and objective
*  and say, hey, you can look at this in a different way? But those voices got drowned out by the utter
*  swill that was being spilt out all the time, right? And I'm not denying that there are some
*  racists in the UK, and that some of them might have voted leave. There were probably some racists
*  who voted remain, whatever. But they're such a minority. And when you've got a media class
*  constantly saying to you, all you poor working class people, you're a scum, you're racist,
*  you hate, whatever, then they're going to go in that voting booth and they're going to say,
*  fuck you. And they're going to vote out. And that's what happened. And it was a big backlash
*  against being patronized. People hated it. And I hate that narrative that we live in a racist
*  country and that Brexit is used as evidence. But I see it as comparable. I think it's very different
*  to the Trump election. But I see the one thing that I think is comparable is that the premise,
*  right, if you've got all these sort of woke activists who say that they believe that we
*  live in this fascist country and that they believe a fascist would vote for Trump. And then when Trump
*  wins, they use that as evidence for the premise that they set up, right? And that's why they double
*  down. Because they're saying, well, he won, so therefore we were right all along. We're a country
*  full of fascists. And it's like, yeah, but your premise wasn't right. So that's how we need to
*  break that sort of cycle of doubling down on the same bullshit and guaranteeing Trump another term
*  by doing so, by the way, I'm pretty sure. Probably. It really depends on how many
*  people get behind Bernie and whether or not Bernie actually gets through. The DNC does not want Bernie.
*  Right. So there's... Well, they didn't last time, did they? No, they don't like him. They fudged it.
*  It's really fascinating. I don't know what it is because I'm not that well versed. Is it because
*  he's a socialist? Is it because, you know... I don't... I think they have zero control over him.
*  I think that's part of the issue as well. Well, you know, in the UK, the comparable figure is
*  Jeremy Corbyn. He's full on socialist left wing. But he, by the way, hates the EU. That's the other
*  complicated thing. I think it's also corporate money. He won't take anything. Right. Because...
*  But that's the socialist principle. Yes. Right. Yeah. And I think the resistance is the rest of
*  them want that money. Is the word socialist over here just a proper dirty word? Yes. Like a real...
*  Dirty. Because you've had this history of... I remember all that stuff about the fear of
*  socialized medicine. You always hear that sort of thing. We've got an NHS that works pretty well.
*  We've got a national health service that works. And you also have independent doctors too, right?
*  Yeah. So if you have a lot of money, you could get a good doctor to fix your name. Yeah. That's
*  right. If you're poor though, the difference is... You can get treated. You can get
*  treated. If you're poor here and you haven't got health insurance, don't you just die?
*  If you get sick or... No. I mean, there's Medicaid. Is that my prejudice about it? Yeah. I mean,
*  there are some systems that are in place, but they're not good. They're not ideal. And a lot
*  of people get saddled down with horrible medical debt if they do get injured. Well, I think...
*  I've got an American friend who had a very serious illness in England. And he... The NHS
*  were brilliant. And it was like, these people... This is amazing. I didn't have to pay for anything.
*  I think there's something really beautiful about that. I love our NHS. And I know people criticize
*  it and say, obviously there's going to be mistakes with such a big institution like that. And there's
*  going to be bureaucrats and all the rest of it. But it's a really wonderful thing that anyone
*  can get treated and they're not going to have a big bill at the end of it. I really love that.
*  We're conditioned to think that anything that involves anything socialist or anything free,
*  anything that's paid for by the government, where someone can't make the ultimate amount
*  of profit, it de-incentivizes them from being very good. Oh, I see. When we think about a doctor,
*  we want a doctor that is pushing really hard to be the best doctor so we can get a Ferrari
*  in a big house because that guy's going to kick ass. That's the American mindset. That's the
*  capitalist mindset, isn't it? Yes. Well, particularly the American mindset because
*  it's not just capitalism, it's exceptionalism and it's like wanting to be number one. I want,
*  hey, who'd you get to do your knee? Oh, I got Dr. Gettleman. He's the fucking best. He does
*  the Lakers. That guy does the Patriots. He's the fucking man. He fixes knees. I go to him and say,
*  everybody wants to go. And you recommend him. Do you know a good shoulder doctor? Oh yeah,
*  Dr. Goldberg. He's the man. He does the fucking boxers. He did Floyd Mayweather,
*  like that kind of shit. It's alien to me. A shoulder doctor, you just go to the NHS and
*  they give you the doctor. I think I'm not against the idea of incentives and people
*  striving to make their lives better and everything. I think that's absolutely fine.
*  But like if Anthony Joshua, say if Anthony Joshua needs shoulder surgery,
*  you know he's not going to NHS. If you're rich, you'll go to private. For a good reason, right?
*  Not because- Because he's probably a better doctor.
*  No. No? No, I tell you why.
*  Shoulder specialist? Look at Anthony Joshua. His shoulders are everything, right? He's a puncher.
*  That's his whole thing. It's no punches. If he blows his shoulders out, he's fucked.
*  It isn't the case that the NHS has substandard doctors. It isn't the case. And the reason for
*  that is it's a vocational thing. So most doctors feel obliged, feel an obligation, a moral obligation
*  to work for the NHS. And they do so for many years. Doctors are great people. If you go into
*  that profession, it's because you want to help people, isn't it? Not because you want the Ferrari.
*  I think it's- In America, it's because you want the Ferrari.
*  Is that right? Okay. No, a lot of them want to help people.
*  I think they're good- Well, they're brilliant people.
*  It's a very difficult thing to achieve. Like to be a doctor, a physician, in fact, it's very hard.
*  Yeah, of course. It's a lot of work and you deserve to be paid well.
*  Yes, I think so. Absolutely. But I also think it comes from a moral place. It comes from a place of good.
*  Yes, ideally, you definitely would think that, yeah.
*  Right. But I think our NHS proves that- I mean, doctors aren't reasonable. They're not poor.
*  They can have nice things. I'm speaking out of ignorance here. I don't know how the NHS is
*  portrayed over here, how our health service is portrayed over here. But do you see it as this
*  scary communist thing where- Oh, yeah. They leave fucking forceps in people's
*  abdomens and shit and forget to stitch people up. Well, I'm sure that happens. We're all human,
*  right? We all make mistakes. Look, I have friends that have experienced socialized medicine in
*  Canada in particular and had some really bad results. Okay. So that is one of the things
*  that people- Can't you experience bad results on a private system as well?
*  100%. And have, and I know friends over here that have, but our prejudice is,
*  aha, I told you. I told you it's that socialized medicine. But meanwhile, I also have friends that
*  mock us for having to pay for things. When you got to go to the doctor, pay for things if you get ill
*  or if you get injured. Yeah. You're so stupid. Why do you have to pay for that? That's crazy.
*  Well, there's a great video where a man in the UK is walking around asking people in England,
*  what do you think it costs to do this in America? What do you think it costs to give birth? It's
*  crazy. Yeah, it's a lot. People like, oh, a hundred dollars, like $10,000. 10,000?
*  Yeah. Like people go crazy. But also don't you think, like if there's a cash incentive
*  for doctors and medicine and the pharmaceutical industry, there's something really dangerous
*  about that. And that's why you've got people who, you know, whenever an insurance claim comes in,
*  you've got these lawyers who are hired to try and undermine the claim and to find some pre-existing
*  condition from years ago and leave you to die. Because the incentive is all about money,
*  not about humanity. And that's... The real scary accusations are unnecessary surgeries.
*  Right. And I have been suggested to have unnecessary surgery personally. Right. There we go.
*  I have avoided it and become very healthy without the surgery. You see, I, yeah, it's because people
*  want to make more money out of you. Well, I think it's also because they, if they have a hammer,
*  they want to hit a nail. Right. Yeah. Like this is what I do. You need a surgery on your neck.
*  Well, on a small level, I experienced that when I went to a private dentist to say,
*  what do I need done? And he told me basically that my whole mouth was rotten and was dying and
*  it would cost that... It wasn't true. I went to an NHS dentist and said, no, you've just got a couple
*  of issues there. We'll sort it out. It'll be 20 quid or something. Oh, that's a real problem in
*  America as well. But these other dentists obviously wanted to make as much money out of me as possible.
*  It's so dark. You know, it's so dark that someone will be willing to do that. Some guy got arrested
*  recently because he was pulling teeth that he didn't have to pull. Oh, come on. Yeah. It's so
*  fucked up. So fucked up that someone would do that. So that's the downside of the cash incentive.
*  For bad people. But again, that falls in the face of your narrative that people that get into doctor
*  or get into medicine are good people. Well, they're not always good people. They're not always good
*  people. Okay. I'm willing to concede that point. Especially, but then maybe it's, maybe they are
*  good people. They do it in a national healthcare system, but they're not, if they are compromised
*  and it becomes an issue of making money, then they might compromise. So I think I've worked out a
*  common thread in our discussion, which is that I tend to think that most people are generally good
*  and I don't think you do. Am I right? I think it's great when people are good. I think it's great
*  when people are good. But you see that as an aberration from the norm, right? I don't think
*  it's an aberration, but I take into consideration the fact that some people suck. Right. I'm willing
*  to do that as well, but I think humanity on the whole is underrated. Oh yeah, for sure. There's no
*  way we'd be able to live. Yeah. Think about how often you go to the movie theater or a restaurant
*  or a bar and you're surrounded by people and no one does anything bad. Yeah. Look, I live in
*  the public eye, right? And I do everything. Like I do so many things in front of large groups of
*  people. Yeah. And you trust them. Most people are great. I do comedy and I'm always in front of
*  live groups of people. 99.9999% of people are awesome. Even hecklers, they're good people.
*  They just get a little drunk. Are they? They're not in the UK. They're annoying. They're annoying
*  here too, but they're just drunk. Because you can't live any other way, can you? You can't live any
*  other way but to trust humanity and to trust other people and to trust that people are essentially
*  good. And that's why I think ultimately these things will be subverted and end, you know,
*  like the woke movement, like the socialism movement. We have a problem in America as well
*  with education being so fucking insanely expensive and insurance for doctors being so insanely
*  expensive that you get these doctors in this position where they're really over the barrel.
*  They have so much debt and so they are incentivized to try to do these unnecessary surgeries.
*  That's a very good point. Yeah. I mean, I know absolutely nothing about your education system.
*  I should just put that out there. So expensive. Right. And you don't,
*  it's not that expensive in England. I think not comparable really. Like how much would it cost
*  to do a degree here, say for instance, if you want to be a lawyer or something? That's a good question.
*  Let's, I'm sure we can Google that. Let's say from the first year of your university study to
*  passing the bar, what kind of debt, Jamie, are most lawyers in? Just college, right? Yeah.
*  Just law school, college, law school. Does it matter where?
*  Does it change depending on the universe? Oh yeah. So Ivy League, say.
*  Okay. Let's go with Harvard. Let's go with the big boys. So if you're an Ivy League,
*  it helps you to get a job presumably. That's the whole point. Yes. He graduated from Harvard.
*  He's the cream of the crop, my boy. Okay. Yeah. You're fucked though. You're half a million in
*  the hole before you can get going. In the UK, it's standardized. Oh, 65K a year. That's a hell
*  of a lot. $65,000. So more than most people make a year, you have to spend on your education
*  while you're not making any money. So yeah, 65K a year. Just think that's stacking up one, two,
*  three, four, five, six. I suppose what they're saying is that's an investment for the future,
*  because if you do this, you'll get the great job. Maybe, but you're almost $400,000 in the hole.
*  By the time you graduate, you're not making any money. It's nowhere near like that in the UK.
*  It's horrible. We have a really good student loan system where the interest is minimal and you
*  don't have to pay it back until you're earning a certain amount and all that. And in fact,
*  when I went to university, I was the last year to get a full grant. I didn't pay for anything.
*  The government paid for absolutely everything. That's awesome. Because it was also means tested
*  back then because my family went well off. I got everything got paid for. That's awesome.
*  That's ideal. I would love that. I mean, for sure, some people get scholarships in America as well.
*  I would just like it if people didn't have to start their life once they're out of education.
*  Already hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. It's just such a burden. But also what do you do
*  if you are from a poorer background? How can you possibly? You can get scholarships. You can get
*  definitely can. But you have to have very good grades. Okay. And you know, I think with a lot
*  of people that they get out of school, first of all, a lot of people sign up for this debt
*  when they're 17, 18 years old, they don't even know what the fuck they're doing. Yeah. And you
*  they're going, come on, we got a loan for you. Get in there, go to work. Who the hell knows what they
*  want to do at 17? No one knows. And if you don't, you get shamed. You feel terrible. Yeah. Going
*  straight to school. I heard this recently at Harvard specifically. Right. That's us. I popped
*  it up on the 20% of Harvard families pay nothing for their students to attend. Well, those are
*  probably just 20% kick ass fucking super good students who get great a bar of 65k for your
*  family income. You get in I think it's like a scholarship for long, right? But you have to
*  have obviously stellar grades, right? You have to accept it, obviously, obviously, to just to get
*  into Harvard in the first place. But do you think it's an effective meritocracy than the US?
*  There's aspects of it that are effective, but it's definitely not perfect. And the student loan
*  issue is a gigantic one. I feel like if we spend so much of our tax money on so many different
*  things that people disagree with, and how much would it cost to have I mean, I'm not talking
*  about for people to don't try. I mean, you should definitely have, there should definitely be
*  requirements for you to get a free education, right? But it should be definitely much easier
*  than it is now. Yeah. And how is your what you call in our country, the public school, like in the
*  terrible, like, as in if you've got nothing and you go to the local comprehensive school,
*  the real issue is high schools, high schools, and grade schools, like if you're poor,
*  goddamn it, there's some rough schools in this country, and they don't get paid much, and the
*  teachers don't give a shit. And there's some good ones, you know, there's definitely some good ones,
*  and there's definitely some people, even in some bad neighborhoods, they get some good educations,
*  but that's few and far between. And this is the point is that if you if you are from one of those
*  backgrounds, the odds are stacked against you. They just are. So it's all very well sort of saying
*  that anyone can succeed if they work hard, but not really. No, not really. No, not really. You
*  definitely don't get as good in advance. I mean, if you look at the when they show how well kids do
*  in private school, and for the rest of it versus public school, pretty staggering differences. And
*  you know, and I see I see the argument both ways, that the people that are in the private school,
*  they're there because their parents care more, and they pay more attention, so the kids study
*  harder. But if those same kids are in public school, and they studied just as hard, they would get by.
*  But yeah, but they would they'd be dealing with crime and violence and all kinds of other shit
*  that the kids in the private schools aren't dealing with and you need much more stress and
*  more like even more stress at home and like, so a lot of issues. I find it astonishing that people
*  won't acknowledge that some people are more advantaged in certain ways. This is why I think
*  when it comes to social advantageous, or the way in which people are prioritized or privileged over
*  other people, it's mostly about money. Ultimately, when we talk about privilege all the time, we hear
*  things about white privilege and heterosexual privilege and stuff like that actually ultimately
*  is about cash. It's about who's the richest. That's for sure. That's a big part of it for sure.
*  And I think that stuff is obscured by all the other the other stuff that well anybody who thinks
*  white privilege is universal needs to go to Kentucky and see the coal miners, right? Because
*  there's some families that live in these insane rural communities in West Virginia. They're so
*  poor. They're so fucked. And everyone around them is on pills and no one has any money. And there's
*  just crime and just poverty. Yeah, you can't. I mean, I have a friend who's from there. He's like,
*  man, you've never seen poverty like this. So couldn't they just come up with a different
*  phrase than white privilege? Because I get the point they're trying to make, which is that if
*  you have two people from exactly the same backgrounds, the person of color is going to
*  face more prejudice. Right? I get that point. And that's, that's right. But the problem is not
*  white privilege. The problem is prejudice. Right? Yes, exactly. Prejudice don't combat why people
*  don't experience the prejudice. Right. And for the white people that do have this advantage that they
*  don't experience prejudice. The only reason why that exists is because of racism. Right. The actual
*  problem is racism. Absolutely. That's not white privilege. No, and just rhetorically, it's a
*  really bad thing to, because people just hear the word privilege and they think, I'm not privileged.
*  Why are they white? Especially poor white people. Yeah. There's an activist in the UK
*  called Monroe Bergdorf. And the phrase she used was, you can still be homeless and have white
*  privilege. Oh, good Lord. And I just think, how is that a helpful thing to say? Like, even if you
*  could break it down philosophically and sort of prove your point and just think in terms of how
*  you come across when you say that. You know, that's not. Again, it's woke. Yeah. It's just
*  the religion. It's their part of the religion. And we really should start referring to it as
*  a religion. We should, but then there will be some pushback on that. The Church of Woke. Church of
*  Woke. Hey, they get tax free status. Just show up at the Woke Cathedral and give all your money to
*  transgender people or whatever. They've got their high priests, haven't they? Yes, they do. They've
*  got their saints, they canonize certain people. They've got all of the hallmarks. But I just think,
*  I mean, I have described it in those terms and I have done today, but is that really effective
*  way to challenge it? Isn't that just going to get people's backs up? Isn't that going to get
*  people a bit? You know, everything you say about it will get people's backs up. But I think at
*  least it'll make people understand that there are some fundamental patterns in human behavior that
*  have existed from the beginning of time. People like structure and they like knowing where the
*  rules are because life in itself is too open-ended. There's too much existential angst. There's too
*  many confusing questions that can't be answered. There's so much going on in life itself that if
*  you have a very rigid ideology, whether it is about a holy creator or whether it's about the
*  fundamental aspects of society that are unfair and need to be rallied against, whether it's
*  woke ideology or whether it's, you know, fill in the blank, whatever other ideology.
*  I just wish I could talk to them more, but they refuse to talk to me.
*  Well, they don't want to be, I mean, you could talk to some the same way that Megan Phelps
*  talked to her husband online. You could talk to the ones that are thinking, maybe this is bullshit.
*  And some of them do think it's bullshit. I know some of them that have broken free.
*  Yeah, I know some former woke people that have woken up.
*  But I also get a lot of messages from people saying, I really like the jokes you're telling,
*  but I will never retweet them. That too. Yeah. They can't say it,
*  but they also want to keep their job. You know, they don't want anybody harassing them.
*  Okay. There's a lot of that, right? There's a lot of people that just want to keep their job.
*  Well, maybe then when I was talking about the tipping point, when does it end?
*  Maybe it's when more people are willing to be honest about their skepticism about the whole
*  thing. I think that's coming. I think, I think is even though people are being very rabid,
*  I think more people are going, what in the fuck is happening? They are.
*  And it's the language policing that gets so annoying. Words are not the problem, folks.
*  It's actual prejudice. That's the problem. Of course.
*  You know, I mean, whatever it is, whatever it is, it's, we've got this issue with telling other
*  people what to do. We've got this issue with wanting people to comply with the standards
*  of behavior that we are adhering to. Well, that's what terrifies me about it,
*  is the sheer certainty of it. When you get into a conversation in the rare occasions where someone
*  from the woke movement will talk to me, it's like it's never crossed their mind that they could be
*  wrong. That is just not in their realm of existence that they would even possibly think for a second,
*  maybe I've got this a bit wrong. And that to me is a horrible, I don't know how you challenge that
*  even, you know? But you can't, just like you can't challenge someone who's a believer in the
*  Westboro Baptist Church, but really does want to walk around with those God hates fags.
*  They find their way out, don't they? Eventually they-
*  Some of them do, but not many. Megan can't even talk to her mom.
*  Really? Yeah, her mom won't talk to her anymore.
*  They even turned on the leader, didn't they? They turned on Fred, folks.
*  He died.
*  Oh, okay. Did they turn on him after he died, said he was a sinner as well? I think they-
*  Probably. That's probably why they think he died.
*  Oh, is that right? They're fucking nuts, man.
*  If he was truly pure, he would have-
*  God would have kept him alive and he was probably thinking about homos. You know, who knows?
*  Right, okay, okay. At least they're consistent. I mean, they are-
*  Hateful, hatefully consistent.
*  They are hatefully consistent, you know? But they don't twist,
*  they are literally interpreting the Bible as it's said, like in a really scary way.
*  Yeah, very scary way. And the fact that it justifies some pretty horrific actions. I mean,
*  can you imagine if your son was a soldier and your son got shot down and you're at the funeral,
*  and these guys are standing in front of the building where you're having a service,
*  and they're saying the reason why your son died is because there's a bunch of people out there
*  that are in love with other men, and they're having sex with men. And so this is the reason why,
*  and they're going to hold up these giant placards.
*  It's horrible.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  That's one of the examples that really gets me, that challenges me in so far as my free speech
*  position because I just, it's so appalling and upsetting when you see that sort of thing. But
*  I can't say that I want to live in a society where people aren't allowed to protest, right?
*  It's messy. It's like everything else in human nature, it's messy. And these woke people need
*  to understand that it's messy too. Life is messy. You can't get 100% compliance from people,
*  and if you want that, you're a bully. You're being mean. They're not going to do it. And you're not
*  right. You're not right. You're definitely not right if you're not willing to debate people on
*  these ideas. You don't even know if you're right.
*  That's what Obama was saying, wasn't it? When he said that people aren't perfect. Don't expect
*  everyone to be perfect.
*  Yes, it was brilliant that he said that.
*  And then straight after he said it, there was an article in the New York Times that said basically,
*  what a boomer thing to say. But that was what the response was. What a boon. That's not a serious
*  response to quite a nuanced point, is it?
*  No, I think every generation thinks they're going to be the ones that change the world.
*  I mean, that's an issue as well. I mean, every generation that comes along thinks that they
*  have the answers that their parents didn't have.
*  I see signs though that the younger generation, so Generation Z, or Z, you'd say, are reacting
*  against the millennial generation. And that's probably where the hope lies, isn't it? Because
*  actually, the millennials are getting old now, and those ideas are getting a bit out of fashion.
*  And the millennials are going to have to pay their bills. The bills are coming. And when the
*  bills are coming, they're like, fuck, I gotta get my shit together.
*  They've got to earn some...
*  Yeah. And then they realize other people aren't working as hard. And like, hey,
*  socialism is great, but I'd like you to work, Mike.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  So ultimately, they'll be destroyed by the realities of a capitalist society, right?
*  Yeah. I mean, ultimately, the realities of life are, show me a young man who is not
*  a liberal, and I'll show you a man with no heart. Show me an old man who's not conservative,
*  and I'll show you a man with no brain.
*  Or Bernie Sanders.
*  He just gets stuck to his guns. A lot of people develop bills, and they see that there's a lot
*  of people that don't want to work hard, and they make excuses for things when the reality
*  is their own behavior that's been holding them back. And there's so many realities that are
*  uncomfortable that we have to address as we get older in life, and we realize how many people
*  have fallen into these classical pitfalls that maybe our parents had told us about,
*  but we thought we knew better.
*  When you talk about liberal, you mean left-wing here. That's what the word is used.
*  When we use it, we don't mean that.
*  What does liberal mean over there?
*  It means sort of like the tradition of liberalism is a belief in freedom, ultimately. It's a belief
*  in the freedom of the press, freedom of speech, individual autonomy. It's those kinds of principles
*  which aren't necessarily left and right in that way. So I actually think the liberal standpoint
*  is the solution to everything, and I mean that in the classical liberal tradition.
*  Okay, yeah.
*  So let me give an example. So if you take the trans issue, right,
*  which I know is something that just by talking about is a bit of a risky thing,
*  although I think the fact that we're not having discussions and debates about that is part of the
*  problem. But if you take the liberal position on that, what you say is anyone has the right to
*  identify however they want, call themselves whatever they want, have surgery on their own body,
*  do whatever they want to do, but then other people have the right to choose the language that they
*  use in terms of addressing them. Everyone has their own individual rights, and that's the liberal
*  position. And that strikes me as the sensible way to do it, you know?
*  Yeah, I think that's the sensible way to do it. I think we should be nice, right?
*  Yeah, be nice.
*  I don't think you could legislate that, right? You can't legislate nice behavior. I think if
*  someone doesn't want to call a trans woman a woman, I don't think you should have to go to jail.
*  That's what I mean. Because that would be an illiberal position.
*  Yes.
*  The woke movement is a fundamentally illiberal movement because it believes in compelled speech.
*  Yes.
*  It believes in not just compelling forms of speech, but also censoring you and saying
*  what you can, absolutely what you cannot say.
*  Demanding compliance.
*  So I'm just sick of them calling themselves liberals. It really annoys me.
*  You guys definitely have a different definition of liberal.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, liberal in America is essentially mostly left-wing. When we hear people call themselves
*  a classical liberal over here, we're like, oh, you're just like a sneaky Republican.
*  Oh, well, that's not what it means where we are. I think we need to restore that idea of
*  liberalism as in what it actually means.
*  Yeah, are classical liberals, well, maybe Jordan. Jordan Peterson is a classical liberal,
*  but he's not American. He's from Toronto.
*  Although everyone says he's conservative, don't they?
*  He's not. I mean, he is in certain things, but he's just a believer in responsibility
*  and hard work. He's a sweetheart of a guy. He really is. He's very open-minded and
*  very intelligent. And I don't disagree with him, rather, on everything, but I definitely
*  respect him. And I'm definitely...
*  And he's onto something with the liberal. If you come from a liberal background as well,
*  you'll be willing to be challenged and you'll be willing to listen to other people. And I think
*  he is.
*  Well, you've over your country, that Kathy Newman interview became huge. So what you're
*  trying to say is, and he's like, I'll tell you what I'm saying.
*  That's incredible.
*  Yeah. I mean, that was...
*  You're trying to put words in my mouth. You're trying to distort my position.
*  I think 98% of all the arguments that go on on Twitter would disappear overnight
*  if people just actually faithfully represented what their opponents were saying.
*  Well, if they saw each other in person and faithfully represented, that's a big part.
*  Although the Kathy Newman thing shows that even that doesn't necessarily help. I mean, she...
*  It did help eventually.
*  But she was literally ignoring what he actually said and substituting it for something. So she
*  wasn't even talking to Jordan Peterson. She was talking to a figment of her imagination called
*  Jordan Peterson. That's not the same thing.
*  Yes, you're dead right. That's not an interview.
*  You're right. You're dead right. That's exactly what it is. And I think she severely underestimated
*  who he is as a human being.
*  I also think she hadn't read the book.
*  No. How could she? She's so busy.
*  Yeah, she's a busy woman. She's very talented, actually. I think that was just a...
*  It was a misstep.
*  Yes, I think that's the best way to describe it. A misstep. And she's been tortured online since then.
*  Which I think is horrible as well.
*  It is. But it's easy. It's easy for people to pick on her.
*  But it's good now that we've got that lesson because that came like a meme then, didn't it?
*  So what you're saying is... That's a really good example of this mischaracterization stuff,
*  which is just so the norm now. And now that we've got that example, it's a way to point...
*  I used to teach critical thinking in school at an A level, which is sort of like 16, 17 year old kids.
*  And one of the first things I teach them is about, firstly, ad hominem attacks. If you throw an
*  insult, you've lost the argument. That's it. It's over. You've lost it. If you don't faithfully
*  represent what the other person's saying, you've lost the argument. That's called a straw man.
*  So you've got all these things. And yet, not just people on Twitter, but people in the mainstream
*  media and politicians are failing on these basic principles of critical thinking and argumentation.
*  So if we can just restore it back in the educational system so people understand,
*  once you throw the insult, you've lost it. I couldn't agree more. But again, this is not
*  in compliance with woke ideology. It's not... That's what frustrates me. So you'd have to
*  adjust woke ideology. Right. And I don't think they're willing to do that because I think they
*  think that they're right. Well, yes, they do. Yeah. And they have a religion. And if you think that
*  you shouldn't take the Lord's name in vain and someone's doing that, that person's a sinner.
*  But if you can go back to the universities and you can reinstate critical thinking there,
*  that will be the solution, I think. Good luck because you've got a lot of woke people teaching.
*  I know. I'm trying to come up with a solution here. I really am.
*  The solution is Generation Z. Yeah, it is. That's the solution. The hope lies with the children.
*  Yeah. But they're getting all these books like Feminist Baby.
*  So... I don't think that shit's gonna work. I think that Feminist Baby stuff is hilarious.
*  And that's also millennials having kids, right? Generation Zs are not having kids yet.
*  And I think they're probably... I think the younger people will laugh at that.
*  I think they should. Yeah. Yeah. I hope they laugh at it.
*  I haven't read Feminist Baby, actually. I don't think anybody has. How about that?
*  No. I think they just buy it. They just buy it and hope the fucking kid comes out good.
*  Listen, man, it's been a pleasure having you on. I really appreciate it.
*  Yeah, it's been great. And everybody, there is a book. It's called
*  Woke, A Guide to Social Justice by Titania McGrath. You can get it. It's hilarious.
*  My friend Bridget Phetasy was the first person to tell me about it.
*  She's great. She's great.
*  Yeah. And she's another person who has
*  become hilarious and famous on Twitter just from being logical and funny.
*  Well, being honest. And being herself.
*  But I tell you, it's so liberating when you just realize, I can say what I want.
*  Yeah, you can. It's such a wonderful thing.
*  You can. And many, many, many people gravitate towards it. And that's the beautiful thing.
*  I don't think it's a war, so I wouldn't say we're winning a battle,
*  but I think there's a lot of people that get it.
*  I think there's every reason to be optimistic.
*  There's a lot of fucking people out there, man. That's part of the problem.
*  And a lot of them have a voice.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  The noise.
*  I think we'll win.
*  The noise.
*  Thank you, brother. I appreciate you being here, man.
*  Thanks a lot.
*  Let's do it again next time you're around.
*  That'd be great. Thank you.
*  Bye, everybody.
