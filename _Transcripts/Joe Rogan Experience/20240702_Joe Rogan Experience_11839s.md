*  You guys are class of one. Class of zero one. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=22.0s)]
*  We were OGs, yeah. The real OGs. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=24.0s)]
*  Yeah. Isn't it wild to see what it's become now? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=26.0s)]
*  I mean, it's literally like the number one live comedy show ever. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=29.0s)]
*  It's insane. It's insane. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=33.0s)]
*  We started so long ago. That's where we met, her and I. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=35.0s)]
*  Yeah, we met. And we've been working together ever since. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=38.0s)]
*  Besties. Yeah, so. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=40.0s)]
*  I've said it before, but I'll say it again. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=41.0s)]
*  Tony's the greatest host of any comedy show ever. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=43.0s)]
*  I know. He's the best. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=45.0s)]
*  He does really good. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=46.0s)]
*  Nobody's better off the cuff. Off the cuff? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=47.0s)]
*  Yeah, amazing. He's so fast. He's so quick. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=49.0s)]
*  And, you know, we owe a lot to him, I feel like, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=52.0s)]
*  because he really helped us get our start. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=55.0s)]
*  We learned a lot from being on that show. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=58.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, being on Kill Tony when we started, we were like. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=60.0s)]
*  Babies. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=62.0s)]
*  That's where we met you. That's where we met. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=63.0s)]
*  I opened for Alfie May because of that. I think Bobby Lee. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=65.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, you opened up for me too in Florida. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=69.0s)]
*  Yeah, you? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=72.0s)]
*  When that started, I remember thinking, what a fun thing he's doing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=73.0s)]
*  You know, it's kind of fun. Yeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=76.0s)]
*  You just go do a minute of stand up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=78.0s)]
*  And it's a nice way for comics to get a chance to like sort of think about comedy too. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=80.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=85.0s)]
*  Because you're like, why is this guy funny? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=86.0s)]
*  Like, what is this? Like, sometimes people are just funny and it's like weird. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=88.0s)]
*  Like weird manner. Like Theo Vaughn, right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=91.0s)]
*  Try putting that down. Put that down on paper. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=94.0s)]
*  You can't. Imagine. You could never. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=96.0s)]
*  My cousin got bit by a gay guy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=98.0s)]
*  So, we'll see. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=100.0s)]
*  Write that down. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=102.0s)]
*  It's true. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=104.0s)]
*  Like if somebody wrote jokes for you, you hired them. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=106.0s)]
*  Like, I'm a really good performer, but I suck at writing jokes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=108.0s)]
*  You write some jokes for me. Like, bro, I got you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=110.0s)]
*  Theo Vaughn is like how Trader Joe's makes snacks. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=112.0s)]
*  I just created jokes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=115.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=117.0s)]
*  It's just like popcorn, but it's also like a chicken salad. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=119.0s)]
*  You're like, what? But it works. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=123.0s)]
*  And you're like, I love this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=125.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. I didn't know about Trader Joe's snacks. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=127.0s)]
*  Oh, Trader Joe's, they say that the food at Trader Joe's seems like it's... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=129.0s)]
*  Trader Joe's was made by an alien who didn't really fully understand grocery stores. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=133.0s)]
*  All the food is like really weird. It's just like weird combinations. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=138.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, they have like this sauce. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=142.0s)]
*  It's like sweet, sour, salty, something popcorn. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=144.0s)]
*  It's four different experiences. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=147.0s)]
*  They got to get it streamlined. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=149.0s)]
*  It's made by Chap GPT for sure. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=151.0s)]
*  Either savory or sweet. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=153.0s)]
*  Don't mix it all up like that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=155.0s)]
*  Yeah, what are you trying to do to people? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=157.0s)]
*  TJ's. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=158.0s)]
*  I try to eat healthy for the most part, but when we were in New York this past weekend, we went to the Bronx. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=160.0s)]
*  I saw that sandwich. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=164.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=166.0s)]
*  We ate this place, G&R Deli. Holy shit. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=168.0s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=170.0s)]
*  I saw that sandwich. I sent that sandwich to my mom, and she called me. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=171.0s)]
*  She said, the sandwich that Joe Rogan just ate looked amazing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=174.0s)]
*  We got to go. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=179.0s)]
*  We drove to the Bronx just to go to that place. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=181.0s)]
*  We went like an hour out of our way because we were staying in Manhattan, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=184.0s)]
*  and then we had to drive to the Bronx and then go from the Bronx to the fights that were in Newark. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=188.0s)]
*  So we went like just to go to that sandwich shop just because I saw it on Instagram. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=193.0s)]
*  Yeah, the picture was one of the best I've ever seen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=199.0s)]
*  It was pretty amazing. I got a spill here, young Jamie. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=202.0s)]
*  I got it. I got it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=205.0s)]
*  He's quick. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=207.0s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=209.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love to take a ... I'll take a detour for food. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=210.0s)]
*  I did something really fat the other day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=213.0s)]
*  Tell us. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=215.0s)]
*  You did something fat? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=216.0s)]
*  Can we say fat? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=218.0s)]
*  She means pH fat. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=219.0s)]
*  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Sounds like we're in trouble. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=221.0s)]
*  Did you see that guy got in trouble for just saying something be Lizzo sized? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=224.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=229.0s)]
*  Yeah. Didn't that happen, Jamie? Did some sportscaster get in trouble? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=230.0s)]
*  Oh my God, terrible basketball. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=234.0s)]
*  We've had trouble for a few things recently. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=236.0s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=238.0s)]
*  I've never made one of those, so to be honest. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=240.0s)]
*  I'm going to shoot you every now and then. You look like a hero. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=242.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=244.0s)]
*  It's funny when you miss. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=246.0s)]
*  Well, it's different because you can't say Kobe now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=248.0s)]
*  It just makes everyone sad, and that changes the shot. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=250.0s)]
*  Right. Well, when I grew up in Boston, everybody would say, Larry Bird. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=252.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=256.0s)]
*  That's a longer name to say. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=257.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it was like Larry Bird was the fucking man in 1980. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=259.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=262.0s)]
*  Look at that. Get the fuck out of here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=263.0s)]
*  That's sickening. It's so good. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=266.0s)]
*  Totally not good for you. Let's just get that out of the way. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=267.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=270.0s)]
*  I'll do it again once a week for the rest of my life. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=271.0s)]
*  I think it's just one of those things. You really shouldn't eat like that every day because you won't be able to stop. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=273.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=277.0s)]
*  First of all, you'll be a full-on addict, and you'll be consuming 40 or 50 times more calories than you actually need. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=278.0s)]
*  So do you always give yourself a break or do you ever go super strict and go like, no snacks, nothing good? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=283.0s)]
*  Yeah, tell us your regimen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=291.0s)]
*  No, no, no. There's no super strict. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=292.0s)]
*  Everything in moderation. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=295.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did one month. I did the carnivore diet, like very strict for one month to see what it was like. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=296.0s)]
*  I lost a lot of fat, but it was boring. I like food. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=301.0s)]
*  And a lot of meat like that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=305.0s)]
*  I like these people. I like their food, their culture. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=306.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's an experience. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=310.0s)]
*  I like food. Yeah, I like Vietnamese food. I like Thai food. I like food. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=311.0s)]
*  Food's the best. It's almost the best reason to travel is to try the different foods. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=316.0s)]
*  It's a great reason to travel. Like, it makes travel, like travel is awesome, but travel and then eating people's food, like eating Thai food in Thailand was fucking amazing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=321.0s)]
*  We gotta go. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=331.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, Thailand's awesome. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=332.0s)]
*  We wanna go. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=334.0s)]
*  You guys should go and do some fucking Muay Thai. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=335.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=337.0s)]
*  Come on, Kim Kongs. I know you can get into that. You're a mean girl. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=338.0s)]
*  Oh, no, I stop. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=341.0s)]
*  You can fucking check out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=342.0s)]
*  I got a concussion and I stopped. I got scared. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=343.0s)]
*  She's in her soft girl era. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=345.0s)]
*  Don't do concussions. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=347.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=348.0s)]
*  She's a soft girl now, Joe. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=349.0s)]
*  Did you see Mark Zuckerberg won a gold medal in a Brazilian jujitsu competition? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=350.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=354.0s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg is a fucking savage. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=355.0s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=357.0s)]
*  This dude has been training jujitsu. This is what he did. He wore a COVID mask and he fucking put a hat on and he hid. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=358.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=364.0s)]
*  And he used an alien. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=365.0s)]
*  Imagine you're right about to compete and maybe your first competition. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=367.0s)]
*  Well, just give it a try. I mean, what's the worst thing that could happen? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=371.0s)]
*  Worst thing that could happen is he gets strangled by a super nerd. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=373.0s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=376.0s)]
*  He's awesome. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=378.0s)]
*  I'm very proud of him. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=379.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=381.0s)]
*  I think it's amazing. It's amazing that he did that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=382.0s)]
*  A few people have done that. Mario Lopez did that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=384.0s)]
*  What's his name? Tom Bain. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=387.0s)]
*  Tom Hardy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=391.0s)]
*  Tom Hardy. Tom Hardy did that a couple times. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=392.0s)]
*  Hot. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=395.0s)]
*  Undeniable. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=396.0s)]
*  You see him in Warrior? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=397.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=399.0s)]
*  Hot as fuck. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=400.0s)]
*  He could be listening to this. I just realized that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=401.0s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=404.0s)]
*  Tom Hardy. I'm not going to do that, but you know what I mean. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=405.0s)]
*  Tom Hardy, you could DM me. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=408.0s)]
*  You have the green light. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=410.0s)]
*  I said yes. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=412.0s)]
*  DM me, mommy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=413.0s)]
*  He was awesome in Warrior. I bought it at Hook, Line, and Sinker. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=415.0s)]
*  There are certain dudes that can just become different people. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=420.0s)]
*  He was a different person in that Venom movie. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=423.0s)]
*  You believed he was that clumsy character in the Venom movie. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=425.0s)]
*  He's incredible. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=429.0s)]
*  He's infected by an alien. Just to pull that off. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=430.0s)]
*  You know how hard it is to pull off? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=433.0s)]
*  You're doing a movie with CGI. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=435.0s)]
*  There's a CGI alien that comes out of you, a giant spider creature. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=437.0s)]
*  It's a different place you have to go in your mind at that point. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=441.0s)]
*  But he actually pulled it off. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=443.0s)]
*  And he does it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=444.0s)]
*  It was good. See, he's got gold medal. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=445.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=448.0s)]
*  Dude's fucking jacked. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=449.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=451.0s)]
*  He's a blue belt. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=452.0s)]
*  We're both just saying wow. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=453.0s)]
*  I'm going to tell you something about blue belts, too. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=455.0s)]
*  By the time you get to blue belt, you're dealing with people that know how to submit people. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=457.0s)]
*  It's just whether or not they can keep it together smoothly. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=461.0s)]
*  There's various levels of that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=463.0s)]
*  When you get to tournaments, you get a lot of the levels are like the guys that really should be a purple belt. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=465.0s)]
*  They're really purple belt level. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=470.0s)]
*  Some instructors are stingy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=472.0s)]
*  So for him to win blue belt, it's very possible. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=474.0s)]
*  He had like real skilled opposition, you know, not like black belt opposition, but they know how to do shit. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=478.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=483.0s)]
*  Look at Zuckerberg strangling bitches. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=484.0s)]
*  Actually, that's pretty hot. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=486.0s)]
*  Zuckerberg, if you're listening, my DMs are open. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=488.0s)]
*  He knows your DMs are open. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=493.0s)]
*  You can just fucking read them. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=495.0s)]
*  He's in them. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=496.0s)]
*  He doesn't even need the FBI. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=497.0s)]
*  He already heard us. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=499.0s)]
*  And it's not in there. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=501.0s)]
*  Your fucking phone is lighting up every time his name gets mentioned. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=504.0s)]
*  It goes into a file. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=507.0s)]
*  I'm super. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=509.0s)]
*  I think that's amazing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=511.0s)]
*  I love when people like just he doesn't have to do anything. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=513.0s)]
*  He's one of the richest people on earth. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=516.0s)]
*  He just takes a chance and tries to get good at this thing and then goes and competes in this thing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=518.0s)]
*  We should all celebrate that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=523.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=524.0s)]
*  But that's probably why he's one of the richest guys on earth, because he just goes for it, commits. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=525.0s)]
*  He's focused. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=530.0s)]
*  You should be like an Instagram motivational speaker. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=531.0s)]
*  I feel like what you just said right there was sternations. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=533.0s)]
*  He just goes for it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=537.0s)]
*  He commits. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=540.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=542.0s)]
*  You just got to be that kind of person. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=544.0s)]
*  Some people just that's their big problem. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=545.0s)]
*  They don't know what to go for. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=547.0s)]
*  So they kind of get stalled in the parking lot. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=549.0s)]
*  Like which direction? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=552.0s)]
*  Where do I go? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=553.0s)]
*  Because they don't have me giving them motivational speeches. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=554.0s)]
*  You need a little shanky in your ear. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=557.0s)]
*  Shanky in your ear. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=559.0s)]
*  I like something besides shanky in your ear though. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=561.0s)]
*  I like shanky in your ear. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=565.0s)]
*  Ashley, that's a great name for a podcast. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=567.0s)]
*  Shanky in your ear. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=570.0s)]
*  It's good, right? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=572.0s)]
*  It does make me laugh. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=574.0s)]
*  It's got a catchy ring to it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=576.0s)]
*  Shanky in your ear. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=577.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you ever want to do a fucking solo spinoff and then we got to do the Kim Conn. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=578.0s)]
*  You remember when Kiss did a spinoff? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=582.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=584.0s)]
*  Kiss had like, I don't know if you remember this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=585.0s)]
*  Do you remember this? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=587.0s)]
*  Did they did a show? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=588.0s)]
*  No, Kiss. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=589.0s)]
*  Kiss the band. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=590.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought they did a reality show. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=591.0s)]
*  I'm sure they did that too. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=592.0s)]
*  They did. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=593.0s)]
*  But they all released their own albums. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=594.0s)]
*  Peter Chris had his solo album. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=596.0s)]
*  Paul Stanley had his solo album. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=598.0s)]
*  Gene Simmons had his solo album. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=600.0s)]
*  Ace Freely had his solo album. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=602.0s)]
*  And they all just sort of competed with each other. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=604.0s)]
*  Do you want us to break up? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=606.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=607.0s)]
*  Think about it though. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=608.0s)]
*  I'm saying if we have shanky in your ear. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=609.0s)]
*  He's saying shanky in your ear is beyond saying I'm Michelle. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=611.0s)]
*  You have to put the podcast together and then you get another one on the side. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=615.0s)]
*  I have shank. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=618.0s)]
*  Yeah, she has a podcast, shank. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=619.0s)]
*  It's called shank. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=621.0s)]
*  Why not shanky in your ear? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=622.0s)]
*  I guess I could rebrand. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=624.0s)]
*  Actually, Rogan and I had a conversation. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=628.0s)]
*  The podcast is shanky in your ear now. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=630.0s)]
*  People who like it now are mad. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=633.0s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=635.0s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=636.0s)]
*  That's terrible advice. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=637.0s)]
*  It is terrible advice. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=638.0s)]
*  Don't listen to me. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=639.0s)]
*  It's funny for now. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=640.0s)]
*  I need to start my own podcast. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=641.0s)]
*  Your mom's house, names like that, they just stick. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=642.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=645.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=646.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=647.0s)]
*  There's certain good names like Call Her Daddy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=648.0s)]
*  It's a great name. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=650.0s)]
*  We love our name, but it took us a second. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=651.0s)]
*  We had an issue. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=654.0s)]
*  We had an issue. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=655.0s)]
*  We had a bad podcast name and we kept having to say it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=656.0s)]
*  And we would get embarrassed. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=659.0s)]
*  Bad. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=660.0s)]
*  It was bad. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=662.0s)]
*  What was it? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=663.0s)]
*  You say it, Kim. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=664.0s)]
*  Don't look at me. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=668.0s)]
*  I'll say it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=669.0s)]
*  I'll say it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=670.0s)]
*  Wait, I want to take my ears off. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=671.0s)]
*  Sticky Kimmy and shank. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=673.0s)]
*  Okay, can we move on? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=677.0s)]
*  That's not that bad. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=678.0s)]
*  That's horrible. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=679.0s)]
*  That's gonna be horrible. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=680.0s)]
*  Okay, and then... [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=681.0s)]
*  Jamie, it's not the worst. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=682.0s)]
*  Jamie, how bad is it? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=683.0s)]
*  You're definitely listening. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=684.0s)]
*  But now it's this bitch. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=685.0s)]
*  You've done a much better job. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=686.0s)]
*  But now it's this bitch and that's so much better. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=688.0s)]
*  This bitch is perfect. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=690.0s)]
*  Well, that's what we say to each other all the time. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=691.0s)]
*  This bitch. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=693.0s)]
*  I love saying that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=694.0s)]
*  I love saying this bitch. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=695.0s)]
*  This bitch is one of the most fun things to say like this bitch. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=696.0s)]
*  Say it to your friends when they say something nuts. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=699.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=701.0s)]
*  You know how many times I said that to Tony Hinchcliffe? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=702.0s)]
*  We gotta get Joe our tote bag. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=704.0s)]
*  We got a this bitch tote bag. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=706.0s)]
*  Oh, please get me one of those. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=708.0s)]
*  And a sweatshirt. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=709.0s)]
*  We gotta get you a this bitch sweatshirt. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=710.0s)]
*  I'll wear that shit. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=711.0s)]
*  This bitch. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=712.0s)]
*  I will 100% wear that shit. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=713.0s)]
*  We say it all the time. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=715.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great thing to say. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=716.0s)]
*  It's a great thing to say. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=718.0s)]
*  Yeah, when we get it on each other's nerves, we'll be like, this bitch. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=719.0s)]
*  It's kind of amazing actually that nobody else had a podcast called This Bitch. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=722.0s)]
*  Wow, you guys caught that. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=726.0s)]
*  That's a good one to catch. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=728.0s)]
*  Well, after we had to say Thicky Kimmy and Shank four times, it started haunting us like Bloody Mary. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=730.0s)]
*  We're like talking to people. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=735.0s)]
*  We were like, we're not doing one more ounce of work till we rename this podcast. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=737.0s)]
*  And then, and it was bad. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=741.0s)]
*  We were like talking to sponsors and they're like, okay, so what's the name? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=743.0s)]
*  I'm like, um. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=745.0s)]
*  We didn't know exactly what we did here. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=746.0s)]
*  We were like, you tell them. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=749.0s)]
*  There's been so many embarrassing things that we've done throughout the years. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=751.0s)]
*  Of course, but that's the beautiful thing is that you can learn on the air. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=755.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=758.0s)]
*  It gives people a chance to get good at something that wouldn't have gotten the chance. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=759.0s)]
*  So if you're going to host a show on CBS or NBC, they'll give you a little bit of time. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=762.0s)]
*  Like, you know, Sarah's the next big thing. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=766.0s)]
*  We're going to give her the Sarah show. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=769.0s)]
*  Hi, everybody. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=770.0s)]
*  Like Ellen, you'd be like Sarah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=771.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, whoa. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=772.0s)]
*  They'll give you a chance. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=773.0s)]
*  They might give an upcoming challenge. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=775.0s)]
*  But if it doesn't go well at first and they lose sponsors or the ratings dip, cut. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=777.0s)]
*  Quick. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=782.0s)]
*  What else we got? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=783.0s)]
*  Dancing for dollars, whatever the fuck they could put on there that's going to make money. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=784.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=787.0s)]
*  But with the Internet, you can sort of fuck around and find your thing, find your voice. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=788.0s)]
*  And it's amazing because the barrier to entry is pretty fucking small. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=793.0s)]
*  Like in comparison, like they have fucked studios, camera trucks and fucking lighting and trust in this and grips and everything. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=797.0s)]
*  It's like every show that gets made by Hollywood, so much money just to put it on. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=806.0s)]
*  We just do it and get better at it. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=811.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=813.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=814.0s)]
*  It really is. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=815.0s)]
*  Even like during the pandemic, I would just be talking by myself in the room. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=816.0s)]
*  I'm like, if I was going to have a threesome by myself because I was because we didn't know if we could hang out with people. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=820.0s)]
*  Well, the good news is Alexa was listening and your boyfriend, Mark. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=825.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, my boyfriend, Mark. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=829.0s)]
*  Here's everything. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=831.0s)]
*  So you're talking to yourself with the same place. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=832.0s)]
*  I was talking to myself like just trying to buy up time on a 45 minute solo pod. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=836.0s)]
*  Oh, I started talking about cartoon threesomes because I'm straight out of content. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=842.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, Betty Boop would feel like the cat. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=848.0s)]
*  I think that's a particularly unique muscle that like Bill Burr has and Tim Dillon has. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=852.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=859.0s)]
*  And Yannis Pappas has. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=860.0s)]
*  There's people that can just rant about a subject and find themselves solo. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=861.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's hard to do. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=867.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=868.0s)]
*  No. And you know what? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=869.0s)]
*  It makes your stand up so much better and it makes your podcasting better. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=870.0s)]
*  If you could just talk by yourself, it makes you feel mentally ill. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=873.0s)]
*  When you're done, you don't even recognize yourself. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=877.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=881.0s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=882.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=884.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=885.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=886.0s)]
*  The pandemic was a moment. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=887.0s)]
*  Yeah. Kim lived another life. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=890.0s)]
*  The Zoom shows. I left. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=892.0s)]
*  I went to Florida and partied. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=893.0s)]
*  Zoom shows were wild. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=894.0s)]
*  They were like, why didn't anybody tell you not to do that? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=896.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=900.0s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=901.0s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=902.0s)]
*  No, I didn't do one Zoom show. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=903.0s)]
*  I did one Zoom show and I think about it every now and then it haunts me. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=904.0s)]
*  It was like, I was just like, why are we doing this? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=909.0s)]
*  This is it's too much. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=911.0s)]
*  It's too weird. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=913.0s)]
*  If we're all stuck, let's not do stand up then for a little bit. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=914.0s)]
*  How about that? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=916.0s)]
*  I thought it was such junkies though. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=917.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=919.0s)]
*  You know what the weirdest thing was? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=920.0s)]
*  Late night talk shows where they're doing it from their webcam. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=921.0s)]
*  Oh, and nobody was laughing? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=924.0s)]
*  No one was laughing. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=925.0s)]
*  It's so nuts. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=926.0s)]
*  I was like, why are we watching this? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=927.0s)]
*  It's like someone practicing new jokes. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=929.0s)]
*  It's like if you had a friend who wanted to say, hey, want to run some ideas by you? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=931.0s)]
*  No. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=934.0s)]
*  I would let them. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=935.0s)]
*  You wouldn't do that for your friend? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=936.0s)]
*  If it was my friend. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=937.0s)]
*  Yeah, a comic friend. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=938.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=939.0s)]
*  They go, listen, does this just have an exercise I'm trying to do? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=940.0s)]
*  I wrote these premises down and I'm going to say, that was what it was like. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=942.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=945.0s)]
*  I was like, what happens if Walmart closes all their stores in San Francisco? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=946.0s)]
*  Is that fucking bull? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=950.0s)]
*  And you'd be like, that one sucks. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=954.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=955.0s)]
*  We could just go over them. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=956.0s)]
*  My apples taste like Clorox. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=957.0s)]
*  It's like stop wiping your groceries with bleach. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=959.0s)]
*  This is so sad. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=963.0s)]
*  It was a sad time. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=964.0s)]
*  It was a weird time, right? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=965.0s)]
*  Well, but you know what? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=966.0s)]
*  I actually really enjoyed staying home and just me and my sister started baking and we [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=967.0s)]
*  bought a bow and arrow and then she almost killed a bird and we never did it again. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=975.0s)]
*  She just pulled out. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=980.0s)]
*  She's like a prodigy. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=982.0s)]
*  She just pulled it out. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=984.0s)]
*  We just put it together. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=985.0s)]
*  We're figuring it out. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=986.0s)]
*  It's going in the ground for me. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=987.0s)]
*  She shoots it once, almost gets it right in the middle. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=989.0s)]
*  She's like, oh, okay. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=992.0s)]
*  She pulls it out. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=993.0s)]
*  We see a bird. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=994.0s)]
*  As a joke, I go, kill it. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=995.0s)]
*  And she goes and clips its wing and a feather flies off and it keeps going. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=996.0s)]
*  And we both were like, and then we just pulled it out. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1001.0s)]
*  And then we just put it down and we were like, we're going to go inside. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1004.0s)]
*  Maybe you're like a natural born archer. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1007.0s)]
*  Maybe this is like a movie. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1009.0s)]
*  Not my first. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1011.0s)]
*  You just give her the bow and they're like, oh my God, how long have you done this for? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1012.0s)]
*  That's actually the third time I ever did it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1015.0s)]
*  That's what it looked like. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1017.0s)]
*  And then they just go, oh my God, she's a natural. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1019.0s)]
*  It's like Paul Newman in that movie about baseball. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1022.0s)]
*  She's the Rain Man of archery. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1024.0s)]
*  Yes, imagine. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1026.0s)]
*  It's just like you just have a natural gift. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1027.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, I don't know if I can fucking do this. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1029.0s)]
*  Like in another life, you were an archer. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1031.0s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1032.0s)]
*  I during the pandemic, I got a mini trampoline. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1033.0s)]
*  I was just bouncing at my parents' house in their backyard. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1036.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1040.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to live stream on the trampoline. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1041.0s)]
*  I'm going to live stream and hula hoop. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1044.0s)]
*  I'm going to just trying to keep myself busy. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1046.0s)]
*  It was very mentally ill to be live streaming and hula hooping. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1048.0s)]
*  It was tough on everyone. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1052.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1054.0s)]
*  It was a tough time. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1055.0s)]
*  It was tough. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1057.0s)]
*  I was in the live watching. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1058.0s)]
*  Tough as a country. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1059.0s)]
*  It was some moments where I didn't know if I was ever going to do stand up again. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1061.0s)]
*  Me too. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1064.0s)]
*  In the beginning, in the early days when we hadn't done it for months, I was like, maybe this is it. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1065.0s)]
*  Maybe this is the new world. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1069.0s)]
*  Maybe stand up is gone. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1071.0s)]
*  Because back then, you didn't really know how deadly is this going to be. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1072.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1076.0s)]
*  Everybody was really worried that it was going to get worse. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1077.0s)]
*  There was a lot of weirdness going on. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1079.0s)]
*  There was people that had it and nothing happened to them. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1081.0s)]
*  People that had it and got fucked up. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1084.0s)]
*  You're like, what is this? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1086.0s)]
*  Stand up is not worth it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1088.0s)]
*  Let's not do stand up. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1089.0s)]
*  I remember I canceled one of the last shows. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1090.0s)]
*  I think it was the improv. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1093.0s)]
*  We were supposed to do a show with the improv. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1095.0s)]
*  The day the comic store was shutting down, the day everything was shutting down. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1097.0s)]
*  I was like, maybe we shouldn't do this. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1100.0s)]
*  If we're going to shut down tomorrow, why are we open tonight? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1102.0s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1105.0s)]
*  Are we in danger? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1107.0s)]
*  If we go out, is this fucking stupid? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1108.0s)]
*  There's something about comedy and comics where they fucking need it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1110.0s)]
*  They're like, just one last one before we go. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1115.0s)]
*  One last one before we die. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1118.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1120.0s)]
*  I don't really feel that way. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1122.0s)]
*  I love stand up. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1125.0s)]
*  It's my favorite thing in the world to do, but I didn't feel like I was. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1126.0s)]
*  I did window sets at the comedy store in the window. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1129.0s)]
*  Like a little sad dog in a pet shop. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1133.0s)]
*  I look like a whore in the window before throwing money at the window. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1135.0s)]
*  It took me a good solid two and a half years to not freak out when someone sneezes. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1138.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1143.0s)]
*  I'm still sensitive about it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1144.0s)]
*  Now if someone coughs and sneezes, you're like, eh. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1146.0s)]
*  Now people still look. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1148.0s)]
*  If someone coughs, the whole room looks up. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1150.0s)]
*  But now it used to not happen. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1152.0s)]
*  But it's not the same look up. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1153.0s)]
*  Like we're all in danger. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1156.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1157.0s)]
*  I was in an elevator where a guy was coughing in Vegas in the heart of it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1158.0s)]
*  This old dude was coughing. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1162.0s)]
*  I was like, Jesus Christ. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1164.0s)]
*  I'm holding my breath on the elevator as an exercise. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1165.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm holding my breath. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1168.0s)]
*  That's how I used to do school when I was younger. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1170.0s)]
*  You just hold your breath and watch it. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1173.0s)]
*  Instead of paying attention, I would just watch the clock and try to beat my last record. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1175.0s)]
*  During the pandemic, did you see Jamar? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1180.0s)]
*  Jamar had on like big goggles. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1183.0s)]
*  He went to the CVS and he got kicked out of the CVS because he had on like snorkeling gear. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1185.0s)]
*  How come you can't do that? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1192.0s)]
*  I think you can do that. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1194.0s)]
*  You know what someone told me? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1195.0s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1196.0s)]
*  Someone told me that you can catch respiratory viruses from your eyeballs. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1198.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1202.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1204.0s)]
*  But you know what someone told me? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1205.0s)]
*  They got that their grandpa got stung in the eye by a bee and it cured his diabetes. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1207.0s)]
*  What? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1213.0s)]
*  That sounds like some folklore. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1214.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1216.0s)]
*  Beekeepers live longer than like the average person because they get stung. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1218.0s)]
*  Where did you learn this? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1223.0s)]
*  And if you have Lyme disease, there's people that take bees and they put it into their backs and it helps all their symptoms. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1224.0s)]
*  There's something about bee stings. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1230.0s)]
*  I have heard people getting a positive benefit from bee stings, but I think it was arthritis. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1232.0s)]
*  Don't come for me, big pharma. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1237.0s)]
*  They cut my throat because they talked about the bees. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1239.0s)]
*  I keep forgetting that there's a... [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1241.0s)]
*  I'm watching this new Netflix thing called, what is it? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1243.0s)]
*  Chimp Empire? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1248.0s)]
*  Is that what it's called? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1249.0s)]
*  Yeah, just before you get too far at the viral infection of lungs through the eye. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1250.0s)]
*  Can you? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1253.0s)]
*  You can. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1254.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1255.0s)]
*  Pathogens that are known agents of ocular infections such as HSV. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1256.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1260.0s)]
*  They often cause severely impaired vision and blindness. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1261.0s)]
*  But viral infection of the lungs through the eye. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1264.0s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1268.0s)]
*  I'm going to start wearing goggles. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1270.0s)]
*  So in that case, they should have left Jamar alone because he was doing a smart thing. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1275.0s)]
*  He was wearing goggles to avoid fucking evil shit. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1276.0s)]
*  And you can keep your eyes covered. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1279.0s)]
*  I bet there's some sort of paperwork that says that the people with glasses get less viral infections than other people. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1280.0s)]
*  My favorite was the people with the shield. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1289.0s)]
*  But then you could reach under the shield and say, hey buddy, it's like a cat hiding under the bed with its tails out there. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1291.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1298.0s)]
*  My favorite video was just someone going outside with a mask on in the winter and blowing. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1299.0s)]
*  And it was just all the air you could see with the mask on still going. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1304.0s)]
*  You could see exactly where a breath would go. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1308.0s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1310.0s)]
*  And it was just everywhere and muffled. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1311.0s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1314.0s)]
*  It's so weird that we went through that for that long. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1316.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1318.0s)]
*  But we learned along the way. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1319.0s)]
*  See, nobody knew why doesn't a mask work? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1320.0s)]
*  In the beginning, it seems like a smart thing to do. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1324.0s)]
*  And plus, it makes people feel better. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1326.0s)]
*  You're doing the right thing. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1328.0s)]
*  We're all just trying to be safe. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1329.0s)]
*  But at a certain point in time, most people should have figured out that doesn't really work. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1331.0s)]
*  You can't have a bandana on and stop a fucking deadly virus. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1338.0s)]
*  You can't have a face shield on. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1341.0s)]
*  We've had face shields. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1342.0s)]
*  Where's that air coming from, bitch? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1344.0s)]
*  You don't even have a filter on your face. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1346.0s)]
*  The face shield was rough. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1348.0s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1350.0s)]
*  And when I saw someone with a face shield, I didn't know what to make of them. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1351.0s)]
*  The first face shield I saw in the wild, I was like, oh shit. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1355.0s)]
*  Reggie Watts had this hilarious getup that we ordered a couple of them. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1358.0s)]
*  These fucking things. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1363.0s)]
*  It was a space helmet. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1364.0s)]
*  And you put a space helmet on and you cinch it up to your neck. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1365.0s)]
*  And it's got like filters inside and everything. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1368.0s)]
*  And it cools you off too. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1370.0s)]
*  What? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1372.0s)]
*  Like a fan? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1373.0s)]
*  So there's a little fan in there? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1374.0s)]
*  I like that. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1375.0s)]
*  Pretty sure there's a fan. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1376.0s)]
*  You know, I don't. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1377.0s)]
*  I will say. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1378.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a fan in there. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1379.0s)]
*  Yeah, here's Reggie. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1380.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1381.0s)]
*  Masks, you know, like. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1382.0s)]
*  Reggie was traveling on airplanes with this. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1383.0s)]
*  No. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1384.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1385.0s)]
*  Well, I would like that because I do feel like airplanes make you really sick. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1386.0s)]
*  Well, if there really was an issue, like a real serious issue, here's a question. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1388.0s)]
*  Like if there's some fucking evil alien virus, there's no known cure. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1393.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1397.0s)]
*  Are you going to, are you going to have to go to the hospital? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1398.0s)]
*  I'm going outside. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1401.0s)]
*  I'm going. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1402.0s)]
*  I'm just going to take it in. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1403.0s)]
*  I'm going. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1404.0s)]
*  I'm actually going to rhinestone mine. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1405.0s)]
*  I get that and I glitter it up. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1406.0s)]
*  Like a, like a hot girl on a motorcycle. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1407.0s)]
*  I make it my own. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1408.0s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1409.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1410.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1411.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1412.0s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1413.0s)]
*  It's just like, who knows? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1414.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1415.0s)]
*  I was nervous when it happened. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1416.0s)]
*  But now if something happens again, I won't take it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1417.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1420.0s)]
*  I'm going to take it and I'm going to take it. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1421.0s)]
*  I'm going to take it. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1424.0s)]
*  I'm going to take it. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1425.0s)]
*  It's going to be. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1426.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1427.0s)]
*  when it happened, but now if something happens again, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1428.0s)]
*  I won't take it seriously. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1430.5s)]
*  I wonder what's gonna happen. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1431.64s)]
*  Yeah, did they try wolf? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1432.56s)]
*  They cried wolf on my ass. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1434.16s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1435.6s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1436.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1437.84s)]
*  But nobody knew in the beginning, right? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1438.84s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1439.84s)]
*  Like, everybody always wants to point [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1440.84s)]
*  to, like, this person's got it wrong, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1442.58s)]
*  but nobody fucking knew in the beginning. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1445.34s)]
*  The thing is... [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1447.28s)]
*  In the beginning, there was so much, like, guesswork. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1448.28s)]
*  There's always a threat. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1450.08s)]
*  If it's not that, it's climate change. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1451.08s)]
*  If it's not climate change, it's homicides. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1453.36s)]
*  If it's not homicides, it's something else. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1456.94s)]
*  There's always a worry. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1458.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1459.98s)]
*  It's never gonna be perfect. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1460.98s)]
*  I saw the nicest sticker the other day [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1461.98s)]
*  on a gas station, the grossest gas station ever. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1463.88s)]
*  I was terrified. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1466.28s)]
*  And when I got out, it was just a sticker that said, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1467.52s)]
*  think of something beautiful. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1469.66s)]
*  And I was like, that's kind of the nicest sticker [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1470.8200000000002s)]
*  I've ever seen. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1472.7s)]
*  It's not corny, and it is really nice. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1473.7s)]
*  And it kind of helps. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1476.2s)]
*  Isn't that sweet? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1477.2s)]
*  She's in her soft girl area. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1478.5s)]
*  I told you. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1479.7s)]
*  I think the mushrooms are kicking in. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1480.7s)]
*  You know what I hate? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1481.7s)]
*  I hate when Kim takes mushrooms, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1483.3400000000001s)]
*  because then she won't let me talk shit about guys. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1485.06s)]
*  She'll be like, he's just a man. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1487.94s)]
*  Yeah, she'll call me, and I'll be like, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1490.54s)]
*  well, maybe he went through something. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1492.28s)]
*  And I'll be like, oh, you're on mushrooms. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1494.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1497.04s)]
*  It stops the gossip from me. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1498.04s)]
*  We're all just people. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1499.04s)]
*  And I go, OK, yeah, that's true. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1500.38s)]
*  It is true. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1502.26s)]
*  Imagine if everybody was on mushrooms, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1503.76s)]
*  and that was just like the prevalent attitude. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1505.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1507.76s)]
*  You wouldn't care if you've been wronged, because you- [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1508.76s)]
*  Isn't it crazy that if that, like, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1511.56s)]
*  as a mass experiment, like, if everybody just took a dose, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1513.42s)]
*  a minor dose, what do you want? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1516.72s)]
*  That stuff? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1519.8600000000001s)]
*  Don't say what that is on the air. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1520.8600000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1522.26s)]
*  Without a way. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1523.26s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1524.26s)]
*  It's going to get us all in trouble. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1525.26s)]
*  No, it's nothing. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1526.26s)]
*  If there was like legal psilocybin, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1527.26s)]
*  and it was regulated so you knew what it was, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1529.26s)]
*  and where it's tested, safe doses, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1531.26s)]
*  and everybody decided to take it all at once, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1534.88s)]
*  everybody, the whole country. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1538.44s)]
*  That would be beautiful. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1539.98s)]
*  You know what happened? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1540.98s)]
*  A bunch of dudes who are criminals [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1542.06s)]
*  would say they were going to take it, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1543.56s)]
*  and then wait and rob everybody whether they're on mushrooms. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1545.56s)]
*  It'd be the worst case of love doesn't find a way. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1548.56s)]
*  It's a great movie. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1551.34s)]
*  They convince everyone about world peace, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1552.84s)]
*  but it's actually just a trick. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1554.58s)]
*  And they just rob everybody blind. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1556.02s)]
*  They break into the stock exchange [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1557.34s)]
*  and fucking clean out all the bitcoins. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1559.18s)]
*  And it's just like the worst trip ever. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1561.78s)]
*  It sounds like a Guy Ritchie movie. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1564.42s)]
*  It's great. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1566.26s)]
*  I'm watching. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1568.22s)]
*  Cut that out. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1568.72s)]
*  Keep it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1569.42s)]
*  Maybe not all at once. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1570.14s)]
*  But if it was available to everybody [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1571.18s)]
*  and they realized the benefits, especially of microdoses, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1573.18s)]
*  just perspective enhancing benefits. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1576.26s)]
*  It helps so many fucking soldiers, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1580.66s)]
*  so many guys who get back and experience combat. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1582.3400000000001s)]
*  They're all fucking wracked by all sorts of emotions [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1585.5800000000002s)]
*  and thoughts and lost friends. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1589.5800000000002s)]
*  And that in MDMA seems to really help. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1591.74s)]
*  I was just going to say, I had a roommate in LA who did MDMA. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1593.94s)]
*  She did a weekend camp therapy with only [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1597.5s)]
*  children of childhood trauma. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1601.02s)]
*  And she came back like a different person. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1602.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1605.7s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1606.62s)]
*  She said it literally changed her life. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1607.42s)]
*  Well, they know that whatever it does, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1609.62s)]
*  that experience of letting go of all your inhibitions. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1612.62s)]
*  And for some people, it can sort of just reset [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1617.08s)]
*  the way you see the world. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1622.86s)]
*  So for soldiers, for so many people that have experienced [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1624.84s)]
*  violence, that is so important for them. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1627.9s)]
*  Why don't we make that available? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1631.6999999999998s)]
*  That could literally help the world. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1632.9399999999998s)]
*  And through MAPS, MAPS is doing those studies with soldiers. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1635.54s)]
*  And they're all very promising. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1640.26s)]
*  It's very interesting stuff. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1641.6599999999999s)]
*  But they're doing it the right way. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1643.34s)]
*  And they're doing it through politics. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1644.6599999999999s)]
*  Because, Joe, then we can't gossip. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1647.2199999999998s)]
*  They need us to gossip. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1651.4599999999998s)]
*  That's how they control us. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1654.3s)]
*  When I did MDMA, I fell in love with a PE teacher [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1657.4599999999998s)]
*  for 24 hours. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1660.54s)]
*  Wow, 24 hours. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1661.74s)]
*  24 hours. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1663.06s)]
*  I got this PE teacher. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1663.78s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1664.74s)]
*  That's the best for me. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1665.22s)]
*  That's how long you fall in love with a PE teacher. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1665.46s)]
*  Yeah, when you sober up, maybe it wasn't love. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1667.3799999999999s)]
*  What would the world be like if you know, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1670.58s)]
*  I mean, think about how many people that [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1673.26s)]
*  are on various medications. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1674.8999999999999s)]
*  What would the world be like if they just came up with something [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1676.06s)]
*  and called it like calm? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1679.46s)]
*  And it was a microdose MDMA that everybody took all day long. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1681.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1686.7s)]
*  So everybody is almost like they're tripping, almost [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1687.5s)]
*  like they're rolling all day long. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1692.3s)]
*  Microdosing. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1693.98s)]
*  Everyone's nice to everyone. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1694.5s)]
*  Everyone's lovely. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1696.1s)]
*  Everyone's friendly. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1697.22s)]
*  People are giving you hugs at CVS. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1698.1s)]
*  They want everyone to do well. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1700.34s)]
*  I want you to be happy. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1701.9s)]
*  Everybody wants you to do well. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1703.14s)]
*  Imagine. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1704.78s)]
*  Imagine. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1705.38s)]
*  Those two things. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1706.5s)]
*  We talked about psilocybin and MDMA. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1707.62s)]
*  They're real. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1709.26s)]
*  We're not making this up. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1710.3s)]
*  They're not like fake things that some people have talked [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1711.46s)]
*  about on internet forums, but they're not real. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1714.62s)]
*  They're fucking real. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1716.58s)]
*  And they're illegal. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1718.22s)]
*  It's like that alone should make us go, what the fuck? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1720.06s)]
*  When is that going to change? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1722.54s)]
*  How are they illegal? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1723.78s)]
*  But like delta, that weird. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1725.1799999999998s)]
*  Delta 9. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1727.6599999999999s)]
*  Is legal. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1728.4199999999998s)]
*  Like how is that a thing? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1729.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1730.98s)]
*  That's a weird high. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1731.46s)]
*  I haven't smoked it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1732.6999999999998s)]
*  It's like a neighbor of weed. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1733.6599999999999s)]
*  It's like I'm weed's neighbor. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1735.74s)]
*  I'm going to tell you what. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1736.98s)]
*  Come on in. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1739.4199999999998s)]
*  Weed will be here soon. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1739.98s)]
*  Will it? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1741.26s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it has any of the ideas that weed has. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1742.54s)]
*  It just repeats weed's ideas. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1745.74s)]
*  It doesn't do such a good job of telling them, well, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1747.86s)]
*  one time when he was 13, his stepdaddy [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1749.86s)]
*  was a real piece of shit. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1752.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh, weed makes you uncomfortable. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1755.1799999999998s)]
*  You don't want to stay for delta. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1757.4599999999998s)]
*  It makes you uncomfortable. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1759.26s)]
*  It's just an odd thing. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1761.74s)]
*  It's weird that they can do that, though. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1764.26s)]
*  It's weird that that's legal. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1766.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1767.78s)]
*  I bought weed one time in Harlem from this guy. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1768.4599999999998s)]
*  Can I say that? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1772.6999999999998s)]
*  Back then, it was probably illegal. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1775.5s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1778.6599999999999s)]
*  This was probably three years ago. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1779.5s)]
*  When did it get legal in New York? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1781.3799999999999s)]
*  Recently. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1783.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1783.9399999999998s)]
*  So it was probably illegal then still. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1784.3s)]
*  You're a criminal. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1785.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1786.86s)]
*  I was doing bad things. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1787.6999999999998s)]
*  A bad bitch. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1788.74s)]
*  But I had always bought from this guy. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1789.6599999999999s)]
*  And right before I recorded my podcast, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1791.6999999999998s)]
*  this was when I was living in New York. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1793.5s)]
*  And I rolled a joint of it. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1795.08s)]
*  And I smoked it with me, my co-host, our guest, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1796.6999999999998s)]
*  all the producers. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1801.78s)]
*  And then while we were smoking it, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1803.3799999999999s)]
*  before the joint was even done, I was like, I'm done. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1806.26s)]
*  And then I was like, we should do a new segment. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1808.9399999999998s)]
*  And we should rap. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1810.9399999999998s)]
*  And everybody was like, what? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1813.1399999999999s)]
*  And I was like, we should start rap. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1814.34s)]
*  I think it would be a good idea if we became a rap thing. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1815.6599999999999s)]
*  And then I just started going off about rap. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1819.3s)]
*  And I was going crazy. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1821.4599999999998s)]
*  And then when we got on, I was like, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1822.4599999999998s)]
*  we have to start the show now, because we [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1823.74s)]
*  have to do this thing before the idea goes. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  And I started getting crazy. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1826.58s)]
*  And then I'm breathing all heavy, and my heart's racing. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1828.86s)]
*  And one of the producers who does a lot of drugs, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1831.78s)]
*  literally said into the mic, I'm the highest I've ever been. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1836.5s)]
*  And then that's when it hit me that I was like, the weed. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1839.9s)]
*  This is not me. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1843.5s)]
*  I realized something happened. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1844.78s)]
*  And we were on air already. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1846.76s)]
*  I was pulling up rap lyrics and dancing to them. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1848.14s)]
*  Those joints that they sprinkled the THC crystals on. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1852.86s)]
*  I know exactly what it was. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1856.82s)]
*  What was it? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1858.5s)]
*  OK. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1859.46s)]
*  After I came down and had them almost call an ambulance on, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1861.54s)]
*  because then I freaked out on the podcast. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1865.42s)]
*  I cried. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1867.02s)]
*  We were looking up the symptoms of fentanyl on the podcast. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1868.3799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1871.78s)]
*  Yes, because I was like, it could be fentanyl. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1872.5s)]
*  I've never felt like this on weed. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1874.8999999999999s)]
*  And then I looked at the bag, and there [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1876.3799999999999s)]
*  was a little bit of cocaine in the bag [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1878.0s)]
*  that he sold me the weed in. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1880.1399999999999s)]
*  So I had smoked crack, basically. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1881.62s)]
*  Crack. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1884.06s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1884.56s)]
*  And did a podcast, a full podcast trying to be a rapper. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1886.06s)]
*  So you would have been a rapper if you had done crack. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1890.46s)]
*  100%. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1893.94s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1895.26s)]
*  100%. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1895.76s)]
*  100%. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1896.26s)]
*  I think I would also be a rapper if I did crack. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1898.14s)]
*  Rhyme shank. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1900.22s)]
*  That was my nickname for a while. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1900.98s)]
*  I like it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1902.5s)]
*  I was rhyming. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1903.02s)]
*  I was like, no one could be around me. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=1903.82s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2020.94s)]
*  He's a famous marijuana activist and researcher, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2021.42s)]
*  and he wrote this book. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2026.3400000000001s)]
*  This guy was like a Goldwater Republican [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2027.7s)]
*  and then met this lady. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2031.82s)]
*  And they were smoking a little marijuana together, hanging out, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2033.74s)]
*  and like all of a sudden he gets it. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2036.42s)]
*  And he goes, oh my god, this is good for you. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2039.26s)]
*  Like this is. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2041.22s)]
*  Like he has all these revelations about it. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2043.18s)]
*  Then he goes into the history. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2044.94s)]
*  Because he's a very smart guy. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2046.62s)]
*  He says, like, how did this happen? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2049.2599999999998s)]
*  And he starts delving into the history of Harry [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2050.82s)]
*  Enslinger and William Randolph Hearst. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2053.54s)]
*  And they conspired to make it look [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2055.86s)]
*  like there was this new drug that was causing [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2057.86s)]
*  all these Mexican guys. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2060.14s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2063.22s)]
*  I got this. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2064.14s)]
*  I thought that was the. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2064.94s)]
*  I thought that was that the drugs were doing. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2066.2599999999998s)]
*  I was like. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2068.2999999999997s)]
*  No, I wish. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2068.8199999999997s)]
*  They were saying that it was causing Mexicans and black men [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2069.9s)]
*  to rape white women. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2073.18s)]
*  They were writing stories about this. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2074.7799999999997s)]
*  And then they came up with the Reefer Madness propaganda films [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2076.46s)]
*  and all this calling it marijuana. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2079.3799999999997s)]
*  They tried to Emmett Till weed. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2080.8199999999997s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2082.22s)]
*  Marijuana was like a slang for Mexican wild tobacco. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2083.02s)]
*  It had nothing to do with. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2087.54s)]
*  Sorry to cut you off. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2089.74s)]
*  But that's why I have like one of my black friends [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2090.5s)]
*  told me that black community likes to call it cannabis, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2093.38s)]
*  not marijuana, because marijuana is associated [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2095.86s)]
*  with that negativity. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2099.54s)]
*  Really? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2102.46s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2103.14s)]
*  with the word marijuana. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2104.38s)]
*  I think it's a cute name. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2105.38s)]
*  Marijuana sounds good. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2107.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2108.66s)]
*  It's my daughter. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2109.14s)]
*  I like to smoke some marijuana. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2110.18s)]
*  But I also like cannabis, too. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2112.5s)]
*  The names aren't important. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2114.54s)]
*  What's important is that people like this Jack Harra guy, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2116.14s)]
*  see if you can pull up that book, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2119.58s)]
*  because it's a very good book, where he talks about, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2120.9s)]
*  he actually had this video that they [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2124.54s)]
*  had made in World War I or World War II. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2126.3799999999997s)]
*  It was Hemp for Victory. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2131.06s)]
*  And it was telling farmers to grow marijuana. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2132.7s)]
*  Like marijuana, the plant marijuana is also hemp. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2136.3399999999997s)]
*  So what marijuana is is a psychoactive female version [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2141.62s)]
*  of a very similar plant. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2145.94s)]
*  So now they've kind of engineered hemp, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2147.1s)]
*  so it doesn't have any THC in it. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2149.3s)]
*  So you can't smoke the hemp. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2151.54s)]
*  But that hemp is what they were fighting. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2153.02s)]
*  They weren't really fighting marijuana. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2156.7400000000002s)]
*  They were fighting hemp, because it's a superior textile. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2158.82s)]
*  It makes the best, most durable clothes. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2161.7400000000002s)]
*  It makes a far superior paper. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2163.98s)]
*  You could use it to build houses with. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2165.98s)]
*  Why doesn't everybody use hemp, then? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2167.62s)]
*  It should be. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2169.54s)]
*  It should be one. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2170.26s)]
*  It also. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2171.02s)]
*  Why not the switch over? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2171.82s)]
*  Because there's a lot of moving pieces [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2173.02s)]
*  when it comes to things like this. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2175.78s)]
*  There's a lot of moving pieces that are in gear. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2177.5800000000004s)]
*  They're moving. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2180.02s)]
*  So hemp is now legal in the United States. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2180.78s)]
*  So then the industry has to kind of build up, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2183.1800000000003s)]
*  and you have to have manufacturing. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2185.1800000000003s)]
*  If you really want to do it, if you really [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2186.7000000000003s)]
*  want a higher skilled labor to make hemp clothes that you [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2188.5s)]
*  built here in America, now it's possible. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2191.38s)]
*  But on it, we used to have to buy our hemp from Canada, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2193.5800000000004s)]
*  because you couldn't grow it in the United States, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2196.3s)]
*  even though it was legal, because it wasn't psychoactive. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2198.3s)]
*  So we had hemp protein powder. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2200.6400000000003s)]
*  And we used to have to get it grown in Canada. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2202.1800000000003s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2204.82s)]
*  We could even hire an American farmer to grow it. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2205.9s)]
*  Yeah, I know that hemp is also like the clothes are anti. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2208.26s)]
*  It's like antibacterial, antifungal. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2212.54s)]
*  What? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2214.7000000000003s)]
*  I didn't know any of this. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2215.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2216.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they make hemp geese. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2216.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2218.2200000000003s)]
*  What? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2218.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I have a hemp ghee. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2219.34s)]
*  Yeah, Datsura. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2221.46s)]
*  Does it smell less? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2222.82s)]
*  You can find them online. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2223.86s)]
*  They're just real durable, like real fucking durable. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2225.94s)]
*  The only thing that's going to break is the threads, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2229.7000000000003s)]
*  and they just restitch it. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2231.86s)]
*  That cloth is not ripping. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2233.1400000000003s)]
*  It's really fucking strong. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2235.42s)]
*  Hemp is a weird thing. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2237.5s)]
*  My friend Todd McCormick had a stalk of hemp on his desk. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2239.2999999999997s)]
*  He's like, pick this up. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2242.7s)]
*  I took it out, and I was like, what the fuck, man? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2243.94s)]
*  It weighs nothing. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2246.34s)]
*  It was hard. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2248.14s)]
*  It was hard like oak, but it weighed nothing. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2249.18s)]
*  It weighed nothing. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2252.62s)]
*  It was like balsa wood. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2253.86s)]
*  I feel like we need to get up on hemp. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2255.54s)]
*  See, we can see a fat hemp stalk. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2257.54s)]
*  So that's the stuff that they turn into clothing. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2260.9s)]
*  So they strip it away. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2263.22s)]
*  It's a very difficult process. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2264.8999999999996s)]
*  And for the longest time, they were [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2267.22s)]
*  doing it with slave labor. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2269.1s)]
*  And then when the cotton gin came along, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2271.02s)]
*  the cotton gin made it easier to process cotton. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2273.2599999999998s)]
*  And so it wasn't until the decorticator was invented. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2276.7799999999997s)]
*  And the decorticator was a new method [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2279.8999999999996s)]
*  to effectively process hemp fiber with a machine. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2282.94s)]
*  So they had this machine that's going to strip it down. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2285.74s)]
*  Because otherwise, they were using it like people [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2287.98s)]
*  were pounding on it and shit. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2289.2599999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2290.4199999999996s)]
*  So this was invented. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2291.06s)]
*  And then all the reaper madness shit came out. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2292.94s)]
*  Because there was a thing. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2295.46s)]
*  I think it was Popular Science Magazine. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2296.7799999999997s)]
*  See if that hemp, the new billion dollar crop. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2298.7799999999997s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2301.14s)]
*  Then they had the two, and they just chose the cotton [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2302.02s)]
*  because there was no drama behind there. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2304.18s)]
*  It wasn't just that it was no. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2306.62s)]
*  It was the people that, William Randolph Hearst [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2307.82s)]
*  was one of them. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2309.94s)]
*  So William Randolph Hearst owned Hearst publications. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2310.66s)]
*  Look, billion dollar crop. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2313.42s)]
*  It was on the cover of the magazine. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2315.5s)]
*  See if you can find the cover, because it's kind of hilarious. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2317.38s)]
*  To see that, that they have this story about this new billion [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2320.46s)]
*  dollar crop, hemp. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2325.58s)]
*  I mean, it's really wild shit. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2328.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2330.54s)]
*  Well, so now can anyone grow hemp? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2333.14s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2335.34s)]
*  Maybe it wasn't on the cover. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2336.02s)]
*  But that's the story right there. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2337.34s)]
*  Hemp, the billion dollar crop. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2338.7s)]
*  God, I swear it was on the cover. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2340.1s)]
*  But I have a fucked up memory sometimes. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2341.5s)]
*  Hemp fiber being delivered from machines ready for baling. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2343.58s)]
*  Piles of pulverized herds beside machine is 77% cellulose. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2346.38s)]
*  So they strip it down with that machine. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2352.9s)]
*  So they immediately were like, OK, now we're [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2354.94s)]
*  going to have this stuff that's lighter, it's better, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2357.98s)]
*  it's stronger. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2361.3s)]
*  It's really like a fucking alien plant. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2362.1800000000003s)]
*  It's real weird. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2364.34s)]
*  When you pick it up, it feels weird. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2365.7400000000002s)]
*  You ever been in a grow room? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2368.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2369.78s)]
*  How weird do those feel? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2370.58s)]
*  So weird. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2371.7000000000003s)]
*  Weird. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2372.5s)]
*  Why do they feel weird? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2373.06s)]
*  There's something else in there with you. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2374.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2376.0600000000004s)]
*  Like Hal is in there with you. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2377.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2379.0600000000004s)]
*  Well, can I tell you? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2379.86s)]
*  Hello, Kim. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2380.82s)]
*  I have a lot of plants, and I feel like that about my plants [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2381.5400000000004s)]
*  in general. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2383.9s)]
*  She calls one of them her dog. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2384.46s)]
*  I have this huge monstera plant, and I swear to God, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2386.2200000000003s)]
*  it just feels alive. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2389.1000000000004s)]
*  And it creeps me out sometimes. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2390.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2392.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of house plants. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2393.5800000000004s)]
*  You're not? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2395.2200000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2395.82s)]
*  Because I think it's like little prisoners. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2396.38s)]
*  I think they're supposed to be not [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2398.26s)]
*  in this little trapped ecosystem relying on you [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2400.6200000000003s)]
*  to play classical music for them. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2402.98s)]
*  I think they want to be out there. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2404.7400000000002s)]
*  Now I'm sad for my plants. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2405.9s)]
*  They don't even get classical music. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2406.86s)]
*  Free them. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2409.26s)]
*  I'm not a fan of corralling up wild things. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2410.1s)]
*  Don't make me feel bad that I have prisoner plants. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2415.7s)]
*  I have to look those babies in the eye every day. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2418.62s)]
*  Well, the thing is that- [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2422.66s)]
*  Now I feel like they hate me. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2423.7400000000002s)]
*  They're so happy. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2425.18s)]
*  They look so good, and they grow so fast. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2425.98s)]
*  Yeah, but you're feeding them. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2428.62s)]
*  I have big windows. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2430.06s)]
*  I bet they like it. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2431.1s)]
*  Maybe they love it. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2431.94s)]
*  Maybe they're like a house cat. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2432.66s)]
*  They fucking love it. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2433.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and I heard that they have eyes. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2434.7s)]
*  Did you hear that? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2436.5s)]
*  Plants have eyes now. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2437.06s)]
*  They can see you. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2438.14s)]
*  That's too far. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2438.98s)]
*  They had receptors. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2439.8199999999997s)]
*  They found out that- [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2441.2599999999998s)]
*  I saw that on TikTok probably. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2442.3399999999997s)]
*  The thing is about plants is that they're communicating [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2444.58s)]
*  with each other through the ground. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2447.2999999999997s)]
*  That's what's fascinating. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2448.66s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2449.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2450.5s)]
*  They're just starting to figure this stuff out. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2450.98s)]
*  They just- I don't know when they realized this, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2453.18s)]
*  but this is like the mycologists have figured it out. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2455.14s)]
*  And all these scientists are realizing [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2457.7s)]

*  You could try it again. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2720.7s)]
*  I trust my gut. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2721.7s)]
*  Maybe that person was having a rough day. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2722.7s)]
*  It's true. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2723.7s)]
*  I trust my gut. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2724.7s)]
*  You should trust your gut. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2725.7s)]
*  But you could run into someone that just got in a car accident. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2726.7s)]
*  Yikes. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2729.7s)]
*  When things happen like that, people get ramped up. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2730.7s)]
*  Yikes. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2732.7s)]
*  No, no, people get ramped up. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2733.7s)]
*  It's like that's why road rage exists, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2734.7s)]
*  because everyone's ramped up, right? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2736.7s)]
*  You're in the car, you have to think fast, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2737.7s)]
*  because you're going fast. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2739.7s)]
*  And then someone's cutting you like, you motherfucker! [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2740.7s)]
*  Because you're already ramped up. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2742.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2744.7s)]
*  So sometimes you could run into someone, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2745.7s)]
*  and some guy just fucking T-boned him, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2746.7s)]
*  ran a red light, and screamed at him, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2748.7s)]
*  and there's a lot of shit going on, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2750.7s)]
*  and the cops didn't help, and then you meet that person. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2751.7s)]
*  And they could be too ramped up. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2754.7s)]
*  And you're like, I think that guy fucking hates me. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2756.7s)]
*  That guy hates everyone right now. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2758.7s)]
*  He's just pissed. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2760.7s)]
*  He almost died in a car accident, and no one cares. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2761.7s)]
*  I got into the most frustrating road rage recently. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2764.7s)]
*  I did. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2767.7s)]
*  And it was just fucking annoying. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2768.7s)]
*  It was like, I do notice that a lot. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2771.7s)]
*  I'm not shitting on LA. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2773.7s)]
*  I'm just saying that I notice in LA, the drivers... [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2774.7s)]
*  Sounds like you're shitting on LA, bitch. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2777.7s)]
*  If I was LA, I'd be like, what, bitch? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2779.7s)]
*  I'll say it right now. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2781.7s)]
*  The traffic is bad, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2783.7s)]
*  because it has the worst drivers in the country. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2784.7s)]
*  LA has the worst drivers in the country, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2786.7s)]
*  because they try to follow the rules too much, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2788.7s)]
*  and they're causing traffic jams. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2791.7s)]
*  No one uses a right lane. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2793.7s)]
*  They're all scared to merge. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2795.7s)]
*  I'm telling you, there's a trick. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2796.7s)]
*  I shouldn't even say it. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2798.7s)]
*  But if you're in LA, you can cut the Google Maps time [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2799.7s)]
*  by four or five minutes just by driving in the right lane. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2802.7s)]
*  Everyone's terrified, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2805.7s)]
*  because they don't want to be rude and merge in [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2806.7s)]
*  a mile up the road. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2808.7s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2809.7s)]
*  Anyways... [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2810.7s)]
*  Boy, you're real specific. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2811.7s)]
*  No, she... [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2813.7s)]
*  She's got like a specific beef with LA drivers. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2814.7s)]
*  That's so specific. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2816.7s)]
*  Don't get her fucking started. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2817.7s)]
*  Listen, here's the problem. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2818.7s)]
*  What do I call them? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2819.7s)]
*  White night cucks. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2820.7s)]
*  If you think LA sucks, New York is like, hold my beer, bitch. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2821.7s)]
*  No. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2826.7s)]
*  Because I was just in New York. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2827.7s)]
*  And they're mad people. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2828.7s)]
*  They just fucking cut in front of everybody. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2829.7s)]
*  They drive like crazy. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2831.7s)]
*  New York is crazier. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2832.7s)]
*  I'll take the LA morons over the New York psychos. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2833.7s)]
*  See, I think the LA morons are also like looking at themselves. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2837.7s)]
*  A little bit of that. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2840.7s)]
*  A little bit of... [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2841.7s)]
*  Does my eyeliner look good? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2842.7s)]
*  No, they're like... [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2843.7s)]
*  There's a camera on them always. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2844.7s)]
*  They're trying to do too much activism too. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2846.7s)]
*  Get your mogul running. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2848.7s)]
*  They stuck. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2849.7s)]
*  They STO. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2850.7s)]
*  Get on that highway. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2851.7s)]
*  With his glasses on. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2853.7s)]
*  I went down a rabbit hole yesterday [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2854.7s)]
*  looking for Jim Morrison's GT500. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2856.7s)]
*  Apparently, there's a lost car out there. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2860.7s)]
*  No one knows where it is. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2863.7s)]
*  No one knows how it went away. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2864.7s)]
*  Jim Morrison had one of the only... [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2866.7s)]
*  There was only a certain number of Shelby GT500s that were made during this year. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2868.7s)]
*  I think it was 1967. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2874.7s)]
*  And this car, he filmed this video of him. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2876.7s)]
*  They made like a movie with it. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2879.7s)]
*  They did some filming with it on the highway. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2882.7s)]
*  There's like photographs of it and there's footage from it. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2884.7s)]
*  And he had this car and then no one knows where it went. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2887.7s)]
*  And you want it. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2892.7s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2893.7s)]
*  But not just me. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2894.7s)]
*  See, the problem with me is I'm the wrong guy for that. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2896.7s)]
*  Because I think old cars are stupid. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2899.7s)]
*  I like to take old cars and turn them into cars that drive like new cars. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2900.7s)]
*  It's like you want brakes, guys. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2904.7s)]
*  Like you want real brakes. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2906.7s)]
*  You don't... [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2908.7s)]
*  Like that nostalgia of bad brakes, you can kiss my ass with that. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2909.7s)]
*  I like... [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2912.7s)]
*  There's a company called Roadster Shop that did a 1969 Camaro for me. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2913.7s)]
*  They take old cars and they give it like a real suspension. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2917.7s)]
*  Independent suspension. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2920.7s)]
*  Full fucking giant six piston brakes. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2922.7s)]
*  Handles, drives, normal starts when you want it to. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2926.7s)]
*  Vroom, vroom, vroom. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2929.7s)]
*  That's stupid. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2930.7s)]
*  So I wouldn't really want it other than to say I had it. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2931.7s)]
*  No, you need to get it. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2933.7s)]
*  You got to get Jim Morrison's car, Joe. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2934.7s)]
*  There's probably some like... [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2937.7s)]
*  You should send out a hunt for it. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2938.7s)]
*  Send out a hunt? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2939.7s)]
*  You should make it a whole thing. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2940.7s)]
*  Like if you find Jim Morrison's car, you get this prize. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2942.7s)]
*  No, no. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2945.7s)]
*  I think it would be like if a comic wanted to get Sam Kenison's car. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2946.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2952.7s)]
*  And a musician bought it instead. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2953.7s)]
*  You'd be like, bitch, give it to us. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2954.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2957.7s)]
*  You know? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2958.7s)]
*  So Jim Morrison's car? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2959.7s)]
*  I feel like a musician has to take that. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2960.7s)]
*  I feel like... [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2962.7s)]
*  You know who should drive Jim Morrison's car? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2963.7s)]
*  Who? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2965.7s)]
*  Gary Clark Jr. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2966.7s)]

*  Austin resident, one of the greatest guitarists of all time. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2974.7s)]
*  Oh, he lives in Austin? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2977.7s)]

*  He's the fucking man. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2981.7s)]
*  There's a cover of one of his albums where he was standing in front of this vintage Cadillac, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2983.7s)]
*  this fucking cool Cadillac. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2990.7s)]
*  I was like, dude, please tell me that's your car. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2992.7s)]
*  He's like, nope. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2995.7s)]
*  I want him to know Gary Clark Jr. to know that my DMs are open. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=2996.7s)]
*  He's quite married. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3000.7s)]
*  Oh. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3002.7s)]
*  Lovely lady. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3003.7s)]
*  I guess it's Zuckerberg then. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3004.7s)]
*  Back to the Zuck. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3006.7s)]
*  Not him hearing that. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3009.7s)]
*  Now he knows he's the second choice. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3010.7s)]
*  No, Zuck. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3012.7s)]
*  Number one. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3013.7s)]
*  Yeah, you can't do that to the Zuck. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3014.7s)]
*  Sorry, Zucky. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3016.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3017.7s)]
*  Zucky, baby. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3018.7s)]
*  The guy's a billionaire. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3019.7s)]
*  He's entering the jujitsu tournaments. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3020.7s)]
*  He's competitive. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3021.7s)]
*  You can't do that to him. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3022.7s)]
*  I'm sorry, Zucky. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3023.7s)]
*  What's he going to put you in, Shanky? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3024.7s)]
*  What? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3025.7s)]
*  What jujitsu move? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3026.7s)]
*  An umplata. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3027.7s)]
*  Maybe a triangle. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3028.7s)]
*  I know the jargon. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3031.7s)]
*  I hang out with fighters. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3034.7s)]
*  Anybody want any coffee? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3036.7s)]
*  I would love coffee, please. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3037.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3038.7s)]
*  Thank you, thank you, thank you. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3039.7s)]
*  That's good. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3040.7s)]
*  But you passed me a cup. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3041.7s)]
*  Hand that to the princess. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3042.7s)]
*  The princess. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3043.7s)]
*  This article says it probably wrecked. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3044.7s)]
*  Is that not what people think? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3046.7s)]
*  Yeah, they don't know, man. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3047.7s)]
*  They think it went missing. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3048.7s)]
*  I went down a rabbit hole and this guy did a video of it. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3049.7s)]
*  And the guy was saying that there's a bunch of different stories. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3053.7s)]
*  One story that he crashed it and left it there and it got towed. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3056.7s)]
*  That I believe. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3060.7s)]
*  Another story. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3061.7s)]
*  Whitney did that. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3062.7s)]
*  So that he parked. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3063.7s)]
*  At Avril Lavigne's house. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3064.7s)]
*  I think her car's still there. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3065.7s)]
*  That sounds like a Whitney move. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3067.7s)]
*  That's like a Mike Tyson move. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3069.7s)]
*  He crashed one of his Bentley's and gave it to the cop. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3071.7s)]
*  You could have this off of them. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3073.7s)]
*  The cop was like, okay. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3075.7s)]
*  The cop had a fucking Bentley for like two days and then they made him give it back to [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3076.7s)]
*  the police force. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3081.7s)]
*  The Mike Tyson interview of him telling the woman journalist to stop speaking out of that [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3082.7s)]
*  shit was kind of funny. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3087.7s)]
*  I don't talk to women unless I fornicate with them. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3089.7s)]
*  And then she was just silent. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3091.7s)]
*  She was like, okay. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3093.7s)]
*  She didn't make another sound. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3094.7s)]
*  When I saw him at the comedy store, it was one of the only times I've been really star [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3096.7s)]
*  struck. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3101.7s)]
*  I saw him at the comedy store. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3102.7s)]
*  He was very nice. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3103.7s)]
*  He talked to me and didn't try to fornicate with me. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3104.7s)]
*  He's the nicest guy ever. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3106.7s)]
*  He was so nice. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3108.7s)]
*  He's very, very nice. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3109.7s)]
*  Believe it or not. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3110.7s)]
*  And he's a very kind person. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3111.7s)]
*  It is a very funny thing to say there. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3112.7s)]
*  Well, back in the day, he was a different person. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3114.7s)]
*  And that's the thing that he was like most afraid of about even working out. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3116.7s)]
*  He said it. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3120.7s)]
*  He said he doesn't want to rekindle his ego. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3121.7s)]
*  And that's what he said when he fought Roy Jones. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3123.7s)]
*  It was a crazy quote. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3125.7s)]
*  It sounded like the gods of war rekindled my ego. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3126.7s)]
*  The gods of war have rekindled my ego? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3129.7s)]
*  I understand that though. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3132.7s)]
*  You know what that guy must have been like from when he won the world title at 20 years [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3133.7s)]
*  old to when Buster Douglas beat him. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3139.7s)]
*  It was just a series of executions. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3142.7s)]
*  It was one of the craziest things that anybody had ever seen in boxing. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3145.7s)]
*  Everybody was so terrified by the time they got in the ring with them. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3148.7s)]
*  They were losing before they got anywhere close to the ring. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3152.7s)]
*  They were terrified of this fucking guy. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3154.7s)]
*  He was like nobody we had ever seen in the heavyweight division. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3156.7s)]
*  So you have to be extreme in every possible part of your life to be riding those RPM. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3159.7s)]
*  Of all the men, super athletes that are great at punching people in the face. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3167.7s)]
*  You excel beyond and above all of them. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3173.7s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3176.7s)]
*  Imagine how sick you are as his opponent. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3177.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3180.7s)]
*  Like right before the fight. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3181.7s)]
*  Terrified. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3182.7s)]
*  Like the feeling that you feel. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3183.7s)]
*  It's like that nausea. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3184.7s)]
*  You're trying to be confident but you know. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3185.7s)]
*  Oh it's sickening. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3189.7s)]
*  You've watched the videos. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3190.7s)]
*  You watched the Marvis Frazier fight. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3191.7s)]
*  The Marvis Frazier fight was one of the most terrifying boxing fights I ever watched. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3193.7s)]
*  The most terrifying boxing fights I ever saw in my life. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3196.7s)]
*  Because it was Marvis Frazier who was the son of the great Joe Frazier. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3198.7s)]
*  Former world heavyweight champion. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3203.7s)]
*  And Marvis Frazier was his son and his son was fighting Mike Tyson in his prime. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3205.7s)]
*  And it was on ABC Wide World of Sports I think. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3210.7s)]
*  What year was this? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3213.7s)]
*  This had to be like 86 or something like that. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3214.7s)]
*  87? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3218.7s)]
*  What year was that young Jamie? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3220.7s)]
*  So it had to be somewhere in the 80s. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3223.7s)]
*  Tyson Frazier. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3227.7s)]
*  July 26th 1986. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3229.7s)]
*  1986. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3231.7s)]
*  Want to see it? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3232.7s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3233.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3234.7s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3235.7s)]
*  Because it's one of the most. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3236.7s)]
*  I feel like I've seen highlights but he probably has a bunch of fights out there. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3237.7s)]
*  Yeah but this is the one that you should see because this was a huge fight. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3240.7s)]
*  Because he was the number two ranked heavyweight contender and he was the man. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3243.7s)]
*  He was on the cover of Sports Illustrated. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3246.7s)]
*  I actually have it framed in my office. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3248.7s)]
*  Sports Illustrated sent it to me. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3250.7s)]
*  It was Mike Tyson. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3251.7s)]
*  It said Kid Dynamite. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3252.7s)]
*  And at the time he was 19 years old. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3255.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3257.7s)]
*  Look how young Jim Lampley looks. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3258.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3260.7s)]
*  So let's scoot ahead to the actual fight itself. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3261.7s)]
*  The fight itself was. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3265.7s)]
*  This is like highlights of other fights that Mike's had. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3266.7s)]
*  So they're basically like setting up the whole Mike Tyson story that he's the most terrifying contender that we've seen since you know Joe Frazier. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3269.7s)]
*  Joe Frazier like kind of dismissed him in some sort of way. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3277.7s)]
*  There's some sort of a verbal back and forth with him and Joe Frazier. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3281.7s)]
*  And so this is Joe's son Marvis. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3284.7s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3287.7s)]
*  Who is fighting Mike Tyson. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3288.7s)]
*  It is fucking. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3291.7s)]
*  Mike Tyson and his prime is hot. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3292.7s)]
*  And look at. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3294.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3295.7s)]
*  He was 20 years old. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3296.7s)]
*  So this is before he fought for the title. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3297.7s)]
*  You got to watch how terrifying this is. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3299.7s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3303.7s)]
*  He's a machine. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3308.7s)]
*  Just right away. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3309.7s)]
*  Bobbin and weaving. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3310.7s)]
*  Jab. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3311.7s)]
*  Big shot. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3312.7s)]
*  Big shots. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3313.7s)]

*  I would like to see that version against any heavyweight that ever lived. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3363.7s)]
*  There was like a period of time where you're like Jesus who's going to beat that guy. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3365.7s)]
*  No thank you. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3369.7s)]

*  I hated that. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3374.7s)]

*  I'm in overalls like off a tab of acid. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3388.7s)]
*  For two days straight. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3391.7s)]
*  Like no sleep. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3394.7s)]
*  And I had a concussion three weeks ago and then he's like you want to fight? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3395.7s)]
*  How'd you get a concussion? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3399.7s)]
*  I got a, doing Muay Thai. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3400.7s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3402.7s)]
*  Just the first time holding pads with this huge guy. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3403.7s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3405.7s)]
*  And I didn't know I got a concussion. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3406.7s)]
*  And then a few days later we were sparring and someone hit me in the back of the head [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3408.7s)]
*  by accident. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3411.7s)]
*  And then when I was driving home I lost my vision. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3412.7s)]
*  And then when I went to the hospital like I said I had post-concussive syndrome. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3414.7s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3418.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3419.7s)]
*  So then I had a concussion. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3420.7s)]
*  You were holding pads for a big guy? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3421.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3422.7s)]
*  And it just the jolt of it gave you a concussion? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3423.7s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3426.7s)]
*  The pads hitting the pad into my head. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3427.7s)]
*  And I could feel it because I'd get migraines after. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3430.7s)]
*  Why are you holding the pads for a big man? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3432.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3435.7s)]
*  That is a good question Joe. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3437.7s)]
*  I shouldn't have been. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3438.7s)]
*  Yeah I wouldn't let you hold the pads for me. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3439.7s)]
*  I would be like don't do that. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3442.7s)]
*  You could hold the pads for me though bitch. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3444.7s)]
*  But you could if you were just, if the guy was just touching them. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3445.7s)]
*  Yeah no he was hitting them hard. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3448.7s)]
*  Yeah that's not, you can't really do that. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3450.7s)]
*  Someone needs to tell him. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3452.7s)]

*  They're like these small dudes but they're so fucking strong at that. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3460.7s)]
*  Just that motion. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3464.7s)]
*  They have so much power. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3467.7s)]
*  They stop these fucking horrendous kicks. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3468.7s)]
*  Yeah I have a friend who just went to Thailand for Muay Thai to train and he said just being in Muay Thai, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3471.7s)]
*  being in Thailand as Muay Thai got so much better in such a short amount of time. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3477.7s)]
*  I would imagine. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3481.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3482.7s)]
*  We were just talking about that in the UFC this past weekend because there's a story, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3483.7s)]
*  this guy Khalil Rountree who was a very good fighter but he lost one fight to this guy Johnny Walker [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3486.7s)]
*  and then decided to go to Thailand and really immerse himself in Muay Thai. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3492.7s)]
*  And he came back and he was a totally different fighter. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3497.7s)]
*  We were like whoa. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3500.7s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3501.7s)]

*  Like what did you do? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3506.7s)]
*  He just like realized he had to be fucking 100% all in and serious and he went to Thailand, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3507.7s)]
*  learned Muay Thai, realized he had some holes in his striking game and patched them all up. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3513.7s)]
*  I feel like I would go to Thailand to do Muay Thai and then I'd spend one day at the beach [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3518.7s)]
*  and be like I'll be there tomorrow. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3522.7s)]
*  And like keep winking at them. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3524.7s)]
*  You'd have to do some sort of like a camp. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3526.7s)]
*  No I really liked it. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3528.7s)]
*  I'll probably go back and do it again. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3529.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3531.7s)]
*  You gotta be careful about concussions though. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3532.7s)]
*  They're not fun. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3533.7s)]
*  I'm just gonna do it for fun and not so. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3534.7s)]
*  I was like training to do a fight at one point and like try to compete and now I'm like I [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3536.7s)]
*  just want to do it and kind of work out. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3540.7s)]
*  That's what's good about jujitsu is that there's much less of that. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3542.7s)]
*  You occasionally bang heads and get a knee in the face accidentally. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3546.7s)]
*  Selfishly I was like please don't get a concussion bitch the podcast will be shit if you can't think. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3550.7s)]
*  Maybe be better. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3554.7s)]
*  Maybe she'll be more reckless. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3555.7s)]
*  She comes in speaking in a different accent like someone after a stroke. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3557.7s)]
*  Lindsay Lohan in Dubai. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3563.7s)]
*  She comes and she can count in Chinese. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3564.7s)]
*  Like all of a sudden out of nowhere. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3566.7s)]

*  Baby geniuses? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3578.7s)]
*  Phenomenon? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3579.7s)]

*  Yeah something happened. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3586.7s)]
*  It became like an angel or some shit. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3587.7s)]
*  There's two movies. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3588.7s)]
*  There's Michael where he's the angel. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3589.7s)]
*  I can't get my hands on it. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3591.7s)]
*  I can't buy it. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3593.7s)]
*  I can't buy these two silly movies. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3594.7s)]
*  That's what people should do movie hybrids. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3598.7s)]
*  Yeah that's like Alien vs Predator. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3601.7s)]
*  So the one where he got electrocuted what kind of powers did he... [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3604.7s)]
*  Oh he became super smart right? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3609.7s)]
*  I think he was like a regular dude and then he got electrocuted. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3611.7s)]
*  And then he was in a bubble. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3613.7s)]
*  Remember the bubble boy? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3614.7s)]
*  If it came out the same year that's probably why. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3616.7s)]
*  Phenomenon and Michael? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3618.7s)]
*  In 96 they both came out. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3620.7s)]
*  96. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3621.7s)]
*  So what was the story of Phenomenon? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3622.7s)]
*  He became super smart right? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3624.7s)]
*  I think he had powers of some kind. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3625.7s)]

*  He doesn't say it. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3633.7s)]
*  He becomes a genius. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3634.7s)]

*  He becomes a genius. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3637.7s)]
*  This is what everybody wants. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3638.7s)]
*  Nobody wants to like work really hard to be a genius. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3639.7s)]
*  Everybody wants to just get hit by lightning. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3641.7s)]
*  This was my mom's favorite movie when I was a kid. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3643.7s)]

*  At his peak. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3658.7s)]
*  Nothing's really good happening to him. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3659.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3661.7s)]

*  Not the dog. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3680.7s)]
*  The dog's picking up on it. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3681.7s)]
*  Oh it's the best movie of all time. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3682.7s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3689.7s)]
*  And we break down this movie phenomenon. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3690.7s)]
*  So I think they're saying like the aliens gave him a blast. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3693.7s)]
*  Is that what it looked like? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3697.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3698.7s)]
*  Because I feel like the same time too. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3699.7s)]
*  The thing in the sky. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3700.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3701.7s)]
*  Fire in the sky came around this time too. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3702.7s)]
*  Oh they were trying to do aliens. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3703.7s)]
*  But Fire in the Sky is about this guy. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3704.7s)]
*  This is Travis Walton. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3707.7s)]
*  Do you know the story of Fire in the Sky? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3708.7s)]
*  No. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3710.7s)]
*  Wait. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3711.7s)]
*  No but I didn't expect the bubble when I turned that. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3712.7s)]
*  I didn't either. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3713.7s)]
*  He gave it to me. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3714.7s)]
*  He gave it to me. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3715.7s)]
*  He gave it to me. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3716.7s)]
*  It was a gift. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3717.7s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3718.7s)]
*  It was a gift. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3719.7s)]
*  Thank you Travis. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3720.7s)]
*  Sit right here. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3721.7s)]
*  Fire in the Sky was amazing. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3722.7s)]
*  What the hell is happening? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3723.7s)]
*  Well it's this man's story. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3724.7s)]
*  The real Travis Walton came in the podcast and told us his story. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3725.7s)]
*  When he was in his early 20s he was a logger. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3728.7s)]
*  And they were going down this road and they saw this thing. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3732.7s)]
*  They don't know what it is. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3737.7s)]
*  It's this bright light that came and landed near where the road was. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3738.7s)]
*  And so they got out of the car. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3743.7s)]
*  They stopped the car. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3745.7s)]
*  And Travis, I guess he was kind of a wild man, he ran towards the thing. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3746.7s)]
*  What? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3750.7s)]
*  He got towards the thing and they all said there was some burst of light. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3751.7s)]
*  He fell to the ground. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3756.7s)]
*  And then they panicked. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3758.7s)]
*  No. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3759.7s)]
*  So hold on. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3760.7s)]
*  They panicked. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3761.7s)]
*  They took off. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3762.7s)]
*  They drive off. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3763.7s)]
*  And then they start screaming in the car. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3764.7s)]
*  We can't fucking leave. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3765.7s)]
*  We can't go. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3766.7s)]
*  We've got to go back. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3767.7s)]
*  We've got to go back and get him. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3768.7s)]
*  Let's go back and get him. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3769.7s)]
*  They turned around. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3770.7s)]
*  They go back. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3771.7s)]
*  He's gone. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3772.7s)]
*  He's missing for five days. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3773.7s)]
*  Five days later he makes a phone call to the police. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3774.7s)]
*  He says, I don't know what happened. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3778.7s)]
*  He tries to explain. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3781.7s)]
*  He gets abducted by a fucking UFO and they fix him. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3783.7s)]
*  Whatever happened to him when he got hit by this blast of energy, he says that they realized he was going to die. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3787.7s)]
*  So they took him aboard and they repaired him. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3794.7s)]
*  I like that. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3797.7s)]
*  And then they brought him back. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3798.7s)]
*  It is a fucking wild story if it's true. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3799.7s)]
*  And this movie was kind of fun. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3803.7s)]
*  Whoa, I want to see this movie. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3805.7s)]
*  But the movie's got a lot of shit in it. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3807.7s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3808.7s)]
*  He's kind of explaining. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3809.7s)]
*  But for the most part they kind of got the story right. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3811.7s)]
*  Which was, and by the way, there was multiple sightings of UFOs in this area. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3814.7s)]
*  What area was it? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3819.7s)]
*  Where was it exactly? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3820.7s)]
*  The whole story is so fun. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3824.7s)]
*  I want to believe it's so bad. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3826.7s)]
*  I mean, the guy has had the same story forever. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3828.7s)]
*  He hasn't changed it. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3830.7s)]
*  And that's always interesting to me that this person would tell this story their whole life. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3831.7s)]
*  I mean, here he was now. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3835.7s)]
*  He's in this white mountain, northeastern Arizona. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3836.7s)]
*  Arizona, that makes sense because that's all those like portals, the energy portals and shit there. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3840.7s)]
*  Yeah, those. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3845.7s)]
*  Right? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3846.7s)]
*  Do people know about those? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3847.7s)]
*  In Sedona there's more Texas. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3849.7s)]
*  We ran into some fucking weird shit in Arizona. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3851.7s)]
*  We ran into this place. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3854.7s)]
*  We drove by it. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3857.7s)]
*  You girls are doing acid. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3858.7s)]
*  Four out of five days. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3859.7s)]
*  No. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3860.7s)]
*  You can run into weird shit at Wendy's. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3861.7s)]
*  No. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3863.7s)]
*  We did actually run into. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3864.7s)]
*  Wendy's Drive Through the Portal. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3866.7s)]
*  We did think we ran into Bono at In-N-Out once. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3867.7s)]
*  Stop bringing it up. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3870.7s)]
*  Remember what I did? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3871.7s)]
*  Yeah, you asked for a picture. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3873.7s)]
*  No. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3874.7s)]
*  Okay, first of all I thought it was Bono for sure. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3875.7s)]
*  And I was trying to fuck this fake Bono. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3877.7s)]
*  It was the Bono impersonator at In-N-Out really got me. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3880.7s)]
*  I go, Kim, sit down. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3884.7s)]
*  Bono's coming. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3886.7s)]
*  She's yelling at me to behave. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3887.7s)]
*  How close was it? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3888.7s)]
*  Like eight out of ten? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3889.7s)]
*  It was close. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3890.7s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3891.7s)]
*  We had a picture of him. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3892.7s)]
*  I hope not. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3893.7s)]
*  Have you ever seen Chinese Elon Musk? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3894.7s)]
*  No, but I want to. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3896.7s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3897.7s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3898.7s)]
*  Chi-Long Musk. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3899.7s)]
*  It's like they really cloned him and they added some sort of dominant Chinese DNA. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3900.7s)]
*  Is it a real person? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3906.7s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3907.7s)]
*  No. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3908.7s)]
*  Jamie, how did you do that? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3909.7s)]
*  With the fake Bono at In-N-Out. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3910.7s)]
*  That guy, you thought that guy was a bono? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3913.7s)]
*  Fucking idiots. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3915.7s)]
*  I was very high. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3916.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3917.7s)]
*  Look at Sarah. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3918.7s)]
*  He's trying to look like him a little bit. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3919.7s)]
*  He's trying. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3920.7s)]
*  Is he really? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3921.7s)]
*  Sarah has love in her eyes too. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3922.7s)]
*  Is he a musician as well? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3923.7s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be hilarious. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3924.7s)]
*  What we're saying is embarrassing. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3925.7s)]
*  Look at the people behind us laughing at us. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3926.7s)]
*  Yeah, let's kill it. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3927.7s)]
*  Kill it. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3928.7s)]
*  This is embarrassing. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3929.7s)]
*  I'm embarrassed for them. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3930.7s)]
*  You think that's bad. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3931.7s)]
*  Fake Bono. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3932.7s)]
*  That's the tip of the iceberg. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3933.7s)]
*  Fake Bono. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3934.7s)]
*  Sometimes people think that's bad. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3935.7s)]
*  That's the tip of the iceberg, ladies. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3936.7s)]
*  Fake Bono. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3937.7s)]
*  Sometimes you get got by a fake Bono. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3938.7s)]
*  And sometimes you start telling fake Bono about your projects. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3940.7s)]
*  Do not bring up the audio. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3943.7s)]
*  I'll cut it. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3946.7s)]
*  Your projects. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3947.7s)]
*  Well, we're working on now. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3948.7s)]
*  Listen, we just did this thing called Stone Science where we got high and we do science [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3949.7s)]
*  experiments. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3955.7s)]
*  We're high right now. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3956.7s)]
*  That is a uniquely LA experience. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3957.7s)]
*  When you talk to someone and then they immediately tell you their projects. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3958.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3963.7s)]
*  We wanted Bono to do a science experiment with us. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3965.7s)]
*  We weren't bragging. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3968.7s)]
*  We wanted to bring him on. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3969.7s)]
*  We had a genius idea while we were having a wild style fry. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3971.7s)]
*  What do they call them? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3975.7s)]
*  Animal style. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3977.7s)]
*  Animal style. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3978.7s)]
*  Not wild style. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3979.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3981.7s)]
*  When you meet somebody though, how many times do you meet somebody and they tell you all [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3982.7s)]
*  the stuff they're doing? [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3986.7s)]
*  So much that I don't even kill it there. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3987.7s)]
*  It's like wasted time before we get to talk. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3990.7s)]
*  It'll make you not friendly. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3993.7s)]
*  Hi, I have an agent. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3995.7s)]
*  It's like what? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3996.7s)]
*  We just met. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3997.7s)]
*  People literally say the words, what are you working on to me every week? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=3998.7s)]
*  And I'm like, what do you mean? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4002.7s)]
*  Because they're all obsessed. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4003.7s)]
*  But imagine, it's like, I want to go through the things I'm working on, a checklist of [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4004.7s)]
*  the things I'm working on with you. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4008.7s)]
*  It's a weird thing to say. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4010.7s)]
*  It is. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4012.7s)]
*  And I'm embarrassed. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4013.7s)]
*  I brought it up to fake Bono actually. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4014.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4016.7s)]
*  Well, you didn't know what to do. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4017.7s)]
*  You panicked. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4018.7s)]
*  I panicked. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4019.7s)]
*  And let me tell you. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4020.7s)]
*  Did you know it was fake Bono at that point? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4021.7s)]
*  No. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4022.7s)]
*  We were high off our minds. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4023.7s)]
*  You're right. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4024.7s)]
*  I thought that was real Bono. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4025.7s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4026.7s)]
*  After talking to him. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4027.7s)]
*  Is that real Bono? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4028.7s)]
*  It kind of looks like. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4029.7s)]
*  That's real Bono. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4030.7s)]
*  That looks like fake Bono. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4031.7s)]
*  Yep. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4032.7s)]
*  Can we bring up a side to side? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4033.7s)]
*  Fake Bono looks better. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4034.7s)]
*  That's what my mom said. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4035.7s)]
*  Imagine. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4036.7s)]
*  My mom looks at fake Bono and goes, fake Bono's nose is nicer than real Bono's nose. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4037.7s)]
*  This looks like the guy it ended up to me. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4042.7s)]
*  Real Bono's way older than that guy. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4044.7s)]
*  Yeah, real Bono. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4046.7s)]
*  Looks rough. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4047.7s)]
*  I'll just bring this up. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4048.7s)]
*  This is their tour in that new sphere in Vegas. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4049.7s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4051.7s)]
*  That's fucking sick. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4052.7s)]
*  I love watching their shows from the 90s. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4053.7s)]
*  Do you know what this sphere in Vegas is? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4056.7s)]
*  Do you guys know what this is? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4057.7s)]
*  No. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4058.7s)]
*  They're going to be able to do the whole thing in LEDs. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4059.7s)]
*  So the entire sphere, the inside of it, there's all these visuals and maps and everything. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4063.7s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4069.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4071.7s)]
*  That's what they're going to be able to do in there. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4072.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4074.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4075.7s)]
*  This is one of the biggest entertainment projects that any company's ever taken on. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4077.7s)]
*  This is nuts. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4084.7s)]
*  This thing is really nuts. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4085.7s)]
*  So when is it opening? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4087.7s)]
*  Later this year, in the fall. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4088.7s)]
*  I think they've already announced some of the dates for their show. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4090.7s)]
*  That's where they're starting to sort of show stuff. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4092.7s)]
*  I want to go see you two in Vegas. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4094.7s)]
*  What does it cost to run a fucking show? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4095.7s)]
*  The lights for the whole building like that? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4098.7s)]
*  The walls, that has to be insane overhead. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4101.7s)]
*  Insane overhead. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4105.7s)]
*  Insane. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4106.7s)]
*  Insane, just to turn everything on. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4107.7s)]
*  Yeah, if I leave the lights on for two days, it's insane. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4109.7s)]
*  So I can't even imagine at the sphere. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4112.7s)]
*  So they're going to have up to four shows a day, too. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4114.7s)]
*  And how good is the software? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4116.7s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4118.7s)]
*  What if it's like fucking Windows 98? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4120.7s)]
*  What if it's crashing and shit? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4123.7s)]
*  What if it overheats? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4125.7s)]
*  Look at it. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4127.7s)]
*  The outside is also LEDs. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4128.7s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4130.7s)]
*  No, that's so cool. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4131.7s)]
*  Wait, so the- [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4132.7s)]
*  The outside is LEDs. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4133.7s)]
*  That is amazing. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4134.7s)]
*  Four shows a night? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4135.7s)]
*  Look at it. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4137.7s)]
*  It's going to look like the fucking Earth. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4138.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4140.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4141.7s)]
*  I think this is definitely rendering, but they should be able to make it look like that. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4142.7s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4144.7s)]
*  If they can make it look like the Earth, I'm going to move to Vegas. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4145.7s)]
*  I want to go to this- [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4148.7s)]
*  I just want to stare at it. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4149.7s)]
*  Yeah, same. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4150.7s)]
*  Same. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4151.7s)]
*  I want to have the experience. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4152.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4154.7s)]
*  Did you watch that Elvis movie? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4156.7s)]
*  I did. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4157.7s)]
*  That was sad. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4158.7s)]
*  It made me sad. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4159.7s)]
*  It made me feel bad for Elvis. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4160.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4162.7s)]
*  Well, it was sad. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4163.7s)]
*  They're shooting him up with drugs so he could keep going. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4164.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4167.7s)]
*  The real Elvis was sad in a lot of ways. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4168.7s)]
*  But it's also, he was traveling down a road where there was no map. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4170.7s)]
*  That's true. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4174.7s)]
*  There was no people that were that famous back then. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4175.7s)]
*  No. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4177.7s)]
*  There was him and then there was the Beatles. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4178.7s)]
*  There was a few before the Buddy Hollies. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4179.7s)]
*  There's some people that got pretty famous, but they didn't get that famous. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4183.7s)]
*  That was crazy famous, weirdly famous. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4189.7s)]
*  Yeah, he got to that- when he did that comeback special and he's on stage and there's the [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4192.7s)]
*  intimate audience with people and people got to see the real Elvis and then America fell [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4199.7s)]
*  in love with him again. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4204.7s)]
*  Like that guy. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4205.7s)]
*  That guy was living in a very strange frequency that very few human beings ever get to exist [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4206.7s)]
*  in. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4215.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4216.7s)]
*  No one had done it before. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4217.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4218.7s)]
*  People were like, this man's gyrating. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4219.7s)]
*  This is XXX stuff. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4221.7s)]
*  And it's so funny. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4223.7s)]
*  Well, you got to realize that television didn't even get invented until like, what was it? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4224.7s)]
*  1930? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4230.7s)]
*  What was it? [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4231.7s)]
*  What was the first television? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4232.7s)]
*  We're going to find out. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4233.7s)]
*  That sounds right, but everyone didn't have them at home. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4234.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4237.7s)]
*  What was the first one that they invented? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4238.7s)]
*  First commercial. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4239.7s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people didn't have them for a long ass time. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4240.7s)]
*  1941. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4243.7s)]
*  1941. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4244.7s)]
*  Well, that was the first commercial television. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4245.7s)]
*  Oh, that's not correct. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4246.7s)]
*  The first commercial television? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4247.7s)]
*  Like you could buy? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4248.7s)]
*  That's the first television commercial. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4249.7s)]
*  Oh, television commercial. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4252.7s)]
*  Oh, they figured out how to make money. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4253.7s)]
*  At the beginning, they were just like broadcasting shit. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4255.7s)]
*  We're going to do a play with puppets. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4257.7s)]
*  Can't do anything back then. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4259.7s)]
*  No one knew what was good or bad. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4261.7s)]
*  It was all new. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4263.7s)]
*  Like radio shows. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4264.7s)]
*  People would watch some of the dumbest things just because they were just like, I can't [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4265.7s)]
*  believe this moving thing's in front of me. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4268.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4270.7s)]
*  People watched some really dumb stuff. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4272.7s)]
*  And then they figured out that it looked kind of dumb. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4274.7s)]
*  And then they started getting better at that. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4276.7s)]
*  But all that stuff is so recent. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4278.7s)]
*  So if they did that in the 1930s and 40s, like the first TV's from 41, by the time that [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4280.7s)]
*  was it. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4286.7s)]
*  It was in the 30s. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4287.7s)]
*  It sounded like I'm looking at there. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4288.7s)]
*  It's telling me that in the Wikipedia, they had stuff going back into the 1800s. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4289.7s)]
*  I'm like, well, what? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4292.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4293.7s)]
*  When would you talk? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4294.7s)]
*  You mean commercials in general? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4295.7s)]
*  No, I mean television. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4296.7s)]
*  So the thing that happened with Elvis is this is the first guy ever that is. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4298.7s)]
*  You're wearing Elvis. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4305.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4306.7s)]
*  I didn't even notice it until right now. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4307.7s)]
*  Roots of Fight. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4310.7s)]
*  Get it before they sell it out. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4311.7s)]
*  But that thing about Elvis is that there was no media before him. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4313.7s)]
*  So when you're dealing with 10 years before that, 20 years before that, you don't have [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4318.7s)]
*  it. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4322.7s)]
*  There's no TV. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4323.7s)]
*  There's no Ed Sullivan show. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4324.7s)]
*  There's no nothing. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4325.7s)]
*  So now all of a sudden there is. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4326.7s)]
*  And now all of a sudden this guy is on TV singing these songs. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4327.7s)]
*  And he's got this fucking perfect hair. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4330.7s)]
*  And he's wiggling his hips. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4332.7s)]
*  Everybody goes fucking crazy. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4333.7s)]
*  Because this is so new. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4334.7s)]
*  This is so new. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4335.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4336.7s)]
*  They're like, this is sexual. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4337.7s)]
*  It's so new to everybody except black people. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4338.7s)]
*  Because you're like hanging out with them. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4339.7s)]
*  That's where you learned everything. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4340.7s)]
*  That was part of the problem too. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4341.7s)]
*  He's like, that's my cousin's dance. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4342.7s)]
*  Hey, my cousin taught him that. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4343.7s)]
*  He didn't know what to do. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4344.7s)]
*  And then the pills probably helped him alleviate his anxiety. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4345.7s)]
*  And they probably kept feeding him the pills because he'll keep performing. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4346.7s)]
*  If you're not a fan of the pills, you're not going to be able to do it. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4347.7s)]
*  And then he's like, I'm going to do it. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4348.7s)]
*  And then he's like, I'm going to do it. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4349.7s)]
*  And then he's like, I'm going to do it. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4350.7s)]
*  And then the pills probably helped him alleviate his anxiety. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4351.7s)]
*  And they probably kept feeding him the pills because he'll keep performing. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4360.0199999999995s)]
*  If you keep feeding him the pills, he's caught. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4363.7s)]
*  And then when people, how would they even clean someone up back then? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4368.22s)]
*  How do you clean up Elvis? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4372.0599999999995s)]
*  You got to tell him? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4373.0599999999995s)]
*  You got to clean up? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4374.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, remember, they couldn't because he had that residency and his manager didn't want [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4375.0599999999995s)]
*  him to stop performing either. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4378.58s)]
*  So that guy was working against him too, which I did not like. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4381.179999999999s)]
*  Well, that guy was a gambling junkie, right? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4383.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4386.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that was. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4387.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know how much of the story is embellished in the movie, but the story they tell in the [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4388.0199999999995s)]
*  movie is like, wow. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4392.9s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4393.9s)]
*  And I can't even look at Tom Hanks the same way ever since he played. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4394.9s)]
*  He's amazing. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4397.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he played amazing. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4398.099999999999s)]
*  He's amazing at being that creepy old dude. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4399.099999999999s)]
*  He killed it. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4400.82s)]
*  Tom Hanks is one of those actors that can be anybody. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4401.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4403.54s)]
*  There's a few of those guys out there and gals. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4404.54s)]
*  When you watch that movie, though, you got to think like Michael Jackson is kind of a [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4407.42s)]
*  similar story, but even weirder because Michael Jackson cracks when he's like six or seven. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4410.9s)]
*  Like how old was he when they were singing ABC? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4417.54s)]
*  How old was that? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4421.82s)]
*  He was a baby. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4422.82s)]
*  He was under 10, right? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4423.82s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4425.82s)]
*  See, pull that up. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4426.82s)]
*  Pull the Jackson 5 ABC. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4428.26s)]
*  1970. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4431.54s)]
*  1970. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4432.54s)]
*  OK. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4433.54s)]
*  So Elvis had already existed, right? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4434.54s)]
*  And you already have big bands. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4437.82s)]
*  There's Led Zeppelin. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4438.82s)]

*  He was an amazing talent. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4566.46s)]
*  And then he became like Elvis, like too unmanageable, unmanageable fame. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4568.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4578.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4579.46s)]

*  air together. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4590.58s)]
*  That might have been a setup. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4591.58s)]
*  I don't think the security is going to allow some guy to just grab him. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4592.58s)]
*  It seems like people slip through. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4597.7s)]

*  And it goes back up. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4612.94s)]

*  I mean, it looks like they're in a relationship. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4628.46s)]
*  He's probably in a basement right now working for Samsung, chained to the wall. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4633.46s)]
*  No, no. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4638.46s)]

*  He's super happy. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4643.46s)]
*  This is the best moment of his life. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4644.46s)]
*  The security who's about to get fired. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4647.26s)]
*  They knew they'd fucked up. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4649.26s)]
*  So look, they just grab the guy and maul him now. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4651.360000000001s)]

*  They obviously want to maul him. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=4657.74s)]

*  And we just spread them all over the country. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5384.6s)]
*  All over the world. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5387.32s)]
*  Shitting out kids. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5388.32s)]
*  Every patch of land, everywhere. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5389.679999999999s)]
*  Just sneezing out babies. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5390.679999999999s)]
*  More kids in Missouri. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5391.679999999999s)]
*  More kids in Orlando. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5392.679999999999s)]
*  We realized that once we're connected to the global hive mind that the more people they [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5395.08s)]
*  are the smarter we get. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5398.44s)]
*  So if we could just get more people, the more people we get we can achieve God status, but [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5400.0s)]
*  we have to have like an extra hundred billion people. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5403.599999999999s)]
*  But this is my question. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5406.04s)]
*  Isn't the sperm getting less potent? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5407.88s)]
*  Is that what you say? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5409.679999999999s)]
*  Are you a connoisseur? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5411.48s)]
*  Are you a sommelier of sea mains? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5412.48s)]
*  I said sperm sommelier. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5415.48s)]
*  I'll let you know. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5416.48s)]
*  It's a lot less tangy. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5419.24s)]
*  A lot less dense, do you say? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5420.24s)]
*  Sperm's changed, you know? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5422.24s)]
*  Tastes a lot less potent these days. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5424.24s)]
*  I used to date a lot of guys who were into kimchi. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5426.24s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5429.24s)]
*  Those days of fermentation. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5431.24s)]
*  I don't know why the sperm tastes like skim milk now. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5432.24s)]
*  Skim milk. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5435.24s)]
*  It's giving skim milk. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5438.24s)]
*  It's not a good time for morale. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5440.24s)]
*  It's a bad time for sperm. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5442.24s)]
*  A lot of guys need to join a CrossFit gym. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5443.24s)]
*  Pineapple juice. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5446.24s)]
*  We need to get going. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5448.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5449.2s)]
*  Yeah, supposedly sperm's dropping. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5450.2s)]
*  But that's supposedly, at least by Dr. Shanna Swan. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5453.2s)]
*  She wrote a book about it called Countdown. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5458.2s)]
*  And it's about plastics, microplastics. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5461.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5465.2s)]
*  BPA's taking away the sperm, okay? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5466.2s)]
*  Not just that. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5469.2s)]
*  It's like fucking with people's reproductive systems. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5470.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5472.2s)]
*  Great. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5473.2s)]
*  They say there's some real evidence that points to that's [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5474.2s)]
*  what happens with mammals. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5476.2s)]
*  You know, it's interesting that the tank gets smaller. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5477.2s)]
*  That's how they find out that there's some sort of [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5480.2s)]
*  feminizing going on. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5482.2s)]
*  Is that in mammals, that's one of the best ways to tell. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5483.2s)]
*  Like when you're looking at a gerbil, it's, what is that? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5487.2s)]
*  A gerbil's taint? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5490.2s)]
*  Is that a vagina or a penis? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5491.2s)]
*  It's so small. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5493.2s)]
*  Well, the size of the taint. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5494.2s)]
*  Because the male taint is 50 to 100% larger than the [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5495.2s)]
*  female's taint. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5498.2s)]
*  The gap is wider. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5499.2s)]
*  You guys have a lot of land over there. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5500.2s)]
*  A lot of useless land. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5503.2s)]
*  A lot of free space. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5504.2s)]
*  A guy's dick and his asshole is like America. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5505.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5508.2s)]
*  It's a lot of stuff that you could do a lot of things with. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5509.2s)]
*  You're like, what's this overpopulation when you fly over [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5512.2s)]
*  the barricade? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5514.2s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a location problem. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5515.2s)]
*  I'm just talking to everybody here. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5516.2s)]
*  This is a lot of space. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5517.2s)]
*  It's not a space issue. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5518.2s)]
*  You bitches need to make new cities. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5520.2s)]
*  But anyway, it shrinks. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5522.2s)]
*  The introduction of these things called phthalates, they [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5525.2s)]
*  somehow or another fuck with the reproductive systems of [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5529.2s)]
*  mammals. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5532.2s)]
*  And one of the things that happens is that their taints [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5533.2s)]
*  become smaller. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5535.2s)]
*  The BPA is taking the taint. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5536.2s)]
*  The penises become smaller. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5537.2s)]
*  Testicles, sperms count, drops. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5538.2s)]
*  Let me tell you, I've had some guys with some BPA issues. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5540.2s)]
*  I have a problem. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5543.2s)]
*  Yeah, but it's also with women, there's more miscarriages. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5544.2s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5546.2s)]
*  Yeah, with women, it seems like it's harder statistically [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5547.2s)]
*  since your introduction of these things. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5552.2s)]
*  It just got real when you said miscarriage. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5554.2s)]
*  Yeah, because if you go back to when they first started [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5556.2s)]
*  having these petrochemical products and people started [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5560.2s)]
*  having plastic in their world most of the time. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5563.2s)]
*  There's a correlating, not necessarily causing, but [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5566.2s)]
*  there's a correlating drop in sperm count that goes like [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5570.2s)]
*  this. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5573.2s)]
*  It's also like culture. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5574.2s)]
*  It's also hard times, big hard men. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5576.2s)]
*  These are fucking soft times. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5579.2s)]
*  They make soft men. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5581.2s)]
*  Soft men make hard times. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5582.2s)]
*  And we're in that spot. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5584.2s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5586.2s)]
*  We're in that spot. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5587.2s)]
*  We're making these hard times, Joe. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5588.2s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5590.2s)]
*  Can we switch it and reverse it for a moment? [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5591.2s)]
*  Hard men, soft times. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5593.2s)]
*  The problem is there's hard men in other parts of the world. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5594.2s)]
*  That's part of the problem. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5597.2s)]
*  And they see some of the nonsense that goes on in this country [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5598.2s)]
*  and they're like, these people are right for the picking. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5601.2s)]
*  Let's invent TikTok and captivate the younger audience. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5605.2s)]
*  But TikTok in China, the youth is getting smarter. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5611.2s)]
*  Their TikTok algorithms are better and ours are just dancing. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5615.2s)]
*  Yeah, they're celebrating science achievements and martial arts. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5619.2s)]
*  They have a different algorithm. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5623.2s)]
*  I'm like, here's my daily routine. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5624.2s)]
*  I think kids are not allowed to use it at night, too. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5626.2s)]
*  I think it shuts off from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. for kids. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5628.2s)]
*  They try to add a STEM channel to TikTok now to make it seem like [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5631.2s)]
*  anyone's going over there. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5635.2s)]
*  Listen, you know what you did. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5637.2s)]
*  You're going to have to take away the funny video first because I'm not [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5639.2s)]
*  choosing between the two. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5643.2s)]
*  I am fascinated by people's quest for attention, that they'll find all [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5644.2s)]
*  sorts of different ways to read naughty books with their glasses on [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5647.2s)]
*  and with their boobs hanging out. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5651.2s)]
*  Everybody's got their hook. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5653.2s)]
*  I'm the hot fisherwoman and I'm the this and that and I'm the guy who [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5656.2s)]
*  lives on the farm. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5660.2s)]
*  Everybody's got this hook. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5661.2s)]
*  The ASMR thing people whisper into the... [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5664.2s)]
*  Love that. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5667.2s)]
*  You know what I love? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5668.2s)]
*  I love watching people fix things. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5669.2s)]
*  Like take an old lighter and refurbish it and bring it back to life and [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5672.2s)]
*  clean it all off and shit. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5676.2s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5677.2s)]
*  It's so satisfying. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5678.2s)]
*  Old watches. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5679.2s)]
*  I take an old watch out and clean it all. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5680.2s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5682.2s)]
*  I have the woman version of that where I clean TikTok where I watch women [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5683.2s)]
*  clean things. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5687.2s)]
*  You look men clean, too. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5688.2s)]
*  I am the complete opposite. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5689.2s)]
*  You like watching them clean stuff? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5690.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5692.2s)]
*  Oh, that's hilarious. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5693.2s)]
*  And it's viral. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5694.2s)]
*  A lot of people watch, but it's satisfying. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5695.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5697.2s)]
*  The way that you liked building something, I liked watching cleaning. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5698.2s)]

*  She's the goat. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5709.2s)]
*  She's the one who recognized that there's a market for this. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5710.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5712.2s)]
*  She did. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5713.2s)]
*  She did, but it's gross. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5714.2s)]

*  So every time I find a nasty zit, just some horrible one that she's got where [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5727.2s)]
*  it's just brown custard coming out in quarts, coming out of some guy's back. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5731.2s)]
*  I love watching it. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5736.2s)]
*  It's satisfying to know the germs are leaving the bod. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5738.2s)]
*  It's weird, though. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5741.2s)]
*  It's like, how'd you let it stay in there that long? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5742.2s)]
*  Why's that thing? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5744.2s)]
*  Why's that thing? [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5745.2s)]
*  Why do you have a horn growing out of your shoulder? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5746.2s)]
*  I start imagining it popping by accident in the wrong place, and then my [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5747.2s)]
*  imagination gets fucked. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5751.2s)]
*  It's like, now how many pimple popped things are there in the world? [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5752.2s)]
*  It's weird when they pull ones out and it leaves a crater. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5756.2s)]
*  You have a knot in there. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5759.2s)]
*  A crater. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5761.2s)]

*  She pulls them out. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5764.2s)]
*  I want to see it, but I don't want to see it. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5765.2s)]
*  Because now I'm left with a question. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5767.2s)]
*  After the next TikTok rolls around, it's like, what about, what happened to the hole? [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5769.2s)]
*  Did you just fill up the hole? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5773.2s)]
*  I hate that. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5775.2s)]
*  Did you just have a hole in his back now? [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5776.2s)]
*  Well, if it's a woman, you just put a little makeup to fill the crater. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5778.2s)]
*  And sometimes you could see a crater. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5781.2s)]
*  A little spackle. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5783.2s)]
*  Yeah, a little spackle when the makeup wears off. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5784.2s)]
*  Nothing worse than a spackled zit. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5786.2s)]
*  If they come up with real gene editing that allows people to be whatever the fuck they want to be. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5788.2s)]
*  I want a blue-eyed baby like that. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5798.2s)]
*  No, like you now. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5800.2s)]
*  What if they get to the point where we can change genes on the fly? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5802.2s)]
*  I don't even know if this is physically possible. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5808.2s)]
*  I know they can edit embryos. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5810.2s)]
*  These Chinese doctors supposedly got in trouble because they did something to prevent HIV. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5812.2s)]
*  And it turned out to make the kids smarter. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5819.2s)]
*  And it was actually like, what they were doing was like this kind of experimental thing to... [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5821.2s)]
*  No. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5825.2s)]
*  Yeah, and like, I don't know. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5827.2s)]
*  We've talked about this and I still can't remember how they got to the... [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5828.2s)]
*  How do you know babies are smarter? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5832.2s)]
*  That's what I was thinking. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5834.2s)]
*  You have to wait a solid 15 years on that one. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5835.2s)]
*  How many years? [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5837.2s)]
*  At least 15. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5838.2s)]
*  We're talking about Michael Jackson. He was 12. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5839.2s)]
*  I was just getting into a testable age. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5840.2s)]
*  What about Amitio Kaku with his particle collider in his garage? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5843.2s)]
*  He was in high school. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5848.2s)]
*  How would you know that they weren't going to be smart anyway? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5850.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5852.2s)]
*  That the CRISPR did it. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5853.2s)]
*  That's kind of what I was thinking. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5854.2s)]
*  In my hometown, there was a kid that got cancer and they did something where they put like dead HIV cells in her body and then she got better. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5855.2s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5863.2s)]
*  And then I never heard... [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5864.2s)]
*  I read like one thing about it and I never heard anything again. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5865.2s)]
*  I know they're doing something like that with cancer. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5866.2s)]
*  They're doing something like that with... [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5868.2s)]
*  I think it's the herpes virus. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5869.2s)]
*  There's something with melanoma and the herpes virus where they're using... [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5871.2s)]
*  I'm going to butcher this. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5876.2s)]

*  I don't want to go on your phone. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5879.2s)]
*  Everyone's going to go try and get herpes now. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5880.2s)]
*  This is one of those things that a friend told me they did the therapy on him and he didn't go into details about it, but he said it saved his life. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5882.2s)]
*  So I said, really? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5889.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5890.2s)]

*  Bro, I got it because I have cancer. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=5896.2s)]

*  Go below that. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6029.2s)]
*  University of Rochester evidence points to fish oil to fight asthma. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6030.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6033.2s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6034.2s)]
*  Omega-3 fatty acids. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6035.2s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6036.2s)]
*  He said a little old woman in Puerto Rico told him that. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6037.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6040.2s)]
*  And she was asking about me and I was in the hospital for it. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6041.2s)]
*  So it's probably, should you eat fish oil in asthma in times of India, omega-3 fatty [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6043.2s)]
*  acid or fish oil helps in reduction of excess immunoglobin antibodies that cause inflammation [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6049.2s)]
*  of the airwaves leading to an asthma attack. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6055.2s)]
*  That's why I want a shark tattoo. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6058.2s)]
*  So it's omega-3s. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6060.2s)]
*  So that's fish oil. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6061.2s)]
*  You could probably get that from all kinds of oil. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6062.2s)]
*  That's great. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6064.2s)]
*  He didn't have to kill a shark. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6065.2s)]
*  No. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6066.2s)]
*  But they probably realized that sharks were cunts. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6067.2s)]
*  They'll fucking bite you when you're surfing. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6069.2s)]
*  You know? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6071.2s)]
*  So why not? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6072.2s)]
*  For the oil. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6073.2s)]
*  People love sharks now. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6074.2s)]
*  I remember one of the weird things where Jaws had everybody hating sharks. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6075.2s)]
*  Like fucking kill them. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6078.2s)]
*  Kill them all. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6079.2s)]
*  But now everyone's like don't kill the sharks. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6080.2s)]
*  What about the fins? [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6082.2s)]
*  It's their ocean. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6083.2s)]
*  It's their home, not yours. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6084.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's the nutty talk. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6087.2s)]
*  We own this bitch. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6088.2s)]
*  This is ours. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6089.2s)]
*  If you want to go back to living in a cave and fighting off bears. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6090.2s)]
*  I'm like guess who can live in both? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6093.2s)]
*  Go right ahead. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6095.2s)]
*  It's my ocean and my land. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6096.2s)]
*  Yeah, shut your mouth. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6098.2s)]
*  We'll go in there with submarines and nuke everything. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6099.2s)]
*  Did the sharks build a tank on wheels and come into fucking LA? [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6102.2s)]
*  No. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6106.2s)]
*  They didn't figure it out quick enough. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6107.2s)]
*  They should have been on the ball. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6108.2s)]
*  We win. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6109.2s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6110.2s)]
*  I see what you guys do to dolphins, you cunts. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6111.2s)]
*  Sharks are monsters. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6114.2s)]
*  They do that to everybody. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6115.2s)]
*  Everybody they can bite. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6116.2s)]
*  Seals, whales. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6117.2s)]
*  It would be cool if sharks could fly. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6118.2s)]
*  No, it would not. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6120.2s)]
*  It would be fucking terrible. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6121.2s)]
*  Okay, bad idea. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6122.2s)]
*  Bad idea. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6123.2s)]
*  Sharknado, right? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6124.2s)]
*  That's what happens in that movie? [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6125.2s)]
*  Sharks landed and bit people. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6126.2s)]
*  It was one of them preposterous. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6127.2s)]
*  I've got to tell you though. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6129.2s)]
*  If you grew up with liars, it's not that crazy. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6130.2s)]
*  If you grew up with people that lie to you all the time, it's not that crazy to believe [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6131.2s)]
*  that other people lie to you as well. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6132.2s)]
*  No one would want the world to be flat more than me. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6133.2s)]
*  I think it would be hilarious. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6134.2s)]
*  I feel like you ... [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6135.2s)]
*  I think it would be hilarious if this whole thing was God playing a joke on us. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6136.2s)]
*  Oh, you figured out space, did you? [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6137.2s)]
*  I would. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6138.2s)]

*  this whole thing was God playing a joke on us. Oh yeah, you figured out space, did you? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6153.04s)]
*  Oh did you figure out space? Congratulations! What you say, a telescope up into my fake [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6158.08s)]
*  sky that I created? Yeah, because I gotta change the scope in the sky. You dummy. I [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6164.12s)]
*  showed you what I wanted you to see. That's why you're seeing UFOs. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6169.44s)]
*  That's technological Jesus. Technological Jesus? It's tech Jesus. I'm hoping for tech Jesus to rescue us. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6173.8s)]
*  His comes in with house music. Not Jesus coming in with house music to pick us up. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6181.72s)]
*  Such a fucking silly time for human beings. Such a silly time for no reason. I feel like [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6189.4400000000005s)]
*  there are always spurts of a lot of UFO sightings at once. Like they come out of [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6197.92s)]
*  my mom and my stepdad's where they had a UFO experience in Costa Rica where they [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6203.4s)]
*  were recording and they said that their camcorder shut off and they said all the [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6208.08s)]
*  sounds around them they were walking to a waterfall. They said everything stopped. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6212.0s)]
*  They were like the birds stopped, the music stopped, they said the water [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6215.5599999999995s)]
*  stopped. It went dead silent and the camera stopped and they had the footage [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6218.799999999999s)]
*  of the camera stopping and then everything came back on like five seconds later. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6223.12s)]
*  What did they say? Nothing. They saw nothing. They said my mom thought she [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6226.44s)]
*  something was medically wrong with her. She was like I thought something was [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6230.68s)]
*  happening to my hearing and then I looked over and she was like your stepdad [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6233.360000000001s)]
*  like was pale because like everything just went like dead and then came back [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6236.280000000001s)]
*  like ten seconds later and then they can hear the kids and and like the people [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6240.56s)]
*  and the tourists. I would not like it if my experience my life experience just got [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6244.320000000001s)]
*  muted in real time. Yeah. And then came back. You guys should watch this movie [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6248.08s)]
*  Moment of Contact. What is it? It's a movie about a crash in Brazil in 1996. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6252.0s)]
*  In Virginia, Brazil. Okay. And by the guy James Fox who made the Phenomenon which [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6258.92s)]
*  is another amazing movie on UFOs. But this this movie that he made about [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6265.5599999999995s)]
*  Virginia, Brazil, the crash is like very heavily documented. There's there's [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6270.88s)]
*  documentation of US Air Force flying in and supposedly picking something up that [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6276.48s)]
*  they think was wreckage or something like that and flying out with it. There's [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6283.0s)]
*  a one of the soldiers apparently had picked up one of the organisms that was [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6286.44s)]
*  there and they they carried it in their car and drove it to like some hospital [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6291.4s)]
*  and to another hospital. They like they have documentation of them taking this [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6296.599999999999s)]
*  thing in. They have the people that did the autopsy on the soldier who died of [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6300.2s)]
*  some insane infections they had never seen ever before. He died of some insane [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6304.54s)]
*  bacteria. He's like a young guy. He was dead very quickly. He should have been [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6308.88s)]
*  wearing glasses. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6312.44s)]
*  Goggles. Goggles. Not a goggle call back. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6313.44s)]
*  But if you're into UFOs, this is one of the best ones I've ever seen. It's really interesting. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6317.44s)]
*  That sounds cool. Because the whole town is convinced that this happened. There's so many [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6322.44s)]
*  people that have that have witnessed experience that they say it's like the [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6326.839999999999s)]
*  whole town revolves around this like there's a lore to it that revolves [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6331.639999999999s)]
*  around this one time where this UFO crashed. It's so crazy. It's fucking wild [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6335.759999999999s)]
*  because when you see these people and you see the people that like when it [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6341.92s)]
*  happened like when they put a camera on and they brought this guy back to the [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6345.96s)]
*  crash site and the guy starts crying he's like weeping talking about where it [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6349.92s)]
*  was and like what it was like to see this thing. We gotta watch this. It's fucking crazy. I get scared. I feel like [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6354.2s)]
*  whenever we watch things about them I feel like they like the plant thing you [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6359.76s)]
*  said I feel like they know. Like Zuck. Oh they know. Like Zuck. Yeah. Like V-Log and Zuck. They're playing us from both sides. They're exactly like Zuck. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6363.24s)]
*  They're the Biden of Trump with the fucking super aliens. I used to feel like that when I watched alien [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6370.24s)]
*  movies I feel like I feel like they can feel us watching them they like it. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6377.5599999999995s)]
*  Well if I was an alien that's how I would do it. I would infiltrate and I would [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6380.92s)]
*  take little little people and I'd put alien thoughts into their little minds. I [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6384.5199999999995s)]
*  would like some alien thoughts. Maybe that's what thoughts are. Maybe thoughts [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6389.4s)]
*  are like a life form we just don't appreciate them. Whoa. Maybe like ideas. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6394.24s)]
*  Think of ideas. Think of ideas. Right. If everything that we have in front of us. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6397.56s)]
*  Yeah. The table, the mugs, the microscope, the microphones rather the phones that you [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6401.080000000001s)]
*  text each other on. All those came from ideas. Somebody had an idea and then [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6406.160000000001s)]
*  physical reality came out of that idea and they made a thing and then more [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6411.400000000001s)]

I was in the middle of saying something the other day and someone interrupted me and it slipped through my fingers. It's been driving me crazy for like two days. That's the worst. I knew there was something there. There's like this spark. I was like oh that's funny. I'm like I'm gonna go back to bed. I'm like I'm gonna go back to bed. I'm gonna go back to bed.

*  It just stops the whole conversation. You point to this guy and they don't ask you another question. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6487.2s)]
*  I get them from Jesus. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6491.44s)]

*  Well if you do have a muse [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6496.44s)]
*  If you do think that your creativity comes from a muse it will work if you just treat it like it's a muse. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6499.44s)]
*  That's the whole premise of the Steven Pressfield book the war of art. I haven't read that one. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6504.76s)]
*  I just started reading the Rick Rubin one. Yeah, we got a stack of them. It's a very small book. It's a real easy read. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6510.16s)]

*  whoops concept of the muse that some like deity comes to you and bestows upon you these ideas. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6519.48s)]
*  Pressfield's argument is that like if you just treat it like it is a muse [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6526.48s)]
*  If you like really pay respects to it and show up every day and try to communicate with the muse it will show up. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6530.6s)]
*  It's real. It's actually real. Yeah, it is real. It is real. But it's what is it? [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6536.6s)]
*  Is that a scaffolding? Like the idea of a muse? Is that just a scaffolding that we can put up to support our [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6542.08s)]
*  the reality that we know is that hard work and [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6551.0s)]
*  concentration and just immersing yourself in this task will eventually yield results. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=6554.88s)]

*  But that's all sewage. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7723.54s)]
*  So they're boiling it. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7725.54s)]
*  And the oils come to the surface. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7727.54s)]

*  You got to go get them. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7760.1s)]
*  And then they sell it to you. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7762.660000000001s)]
*  And you got canola oil. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7764.660000000001s)]
*  Now you have monkey slaves. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7766.660000000001s)]

*  What did the monkey do? [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7795.22s)]
*  I think the monkey bit... [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7797.22s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was my cousin. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7799.22s)]
*  It's one of those weird ones. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7801.22s)]
*  I blocked it out I think. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7803.22s)]
*  Because I was very young. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7805.22s)]
*  I think I was probably like 5. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7807.22s)]
*  The monkey was wild. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7809.22s)]
*  She had a monkey and the monkey would open pieces of gum. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7811.22s)]
*  Undo the wrapping. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7813.22s)]
*  The monkey did not like kids. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7815.22s)]
*  And she did not like anybody coming over the house. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7817.22s)]
*  That was going to take attention from the monkey. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7819.780000000001s)]
*  The monkey had a relationship with my grandmother. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7821.780000000001s)]
*  I don't need a scorned monkey. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7823.780000000001s)]

*  So after the monkey bit one of the relatives. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7827.780000000001s)]
*  They had to get rid of the monkey. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7829.780000000001s)]
*  I'm glad they got rid of it. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7831.780000000001s)]
*  Because you know some crazy people [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7833.780000000001s)]
*  they keep the monkey after it attacks. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7835.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah my grandmother was pretty eccentric. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7837.780000000001s)]
*  But I don't think she was that eccentric. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7839.780000000001s)]
*  She had a monkey. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7841.780000000001s)]

*  My grandmother was wild. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7848.34s)]
*  When you put your monkey in overalls. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7850.34s)]

*  My grandmother did time. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7856.34s)]
*  Because she wouldn't rat out the mob. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7858.34s)]
*  She was running numbers. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7860.34s)]
*  The monkey was running the numbers on a calculator. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7862.34s)]
*  My grandmother was doing it. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7864.34s)]

*  She was like I don't know nothing. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7868.34s)]
*  They put her in jail. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7870.34s)]
*  We were always like where's grandma? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7872.34s)]
*  And they were like oh grandma is visiting Aunt Jeannie. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7874.34s)]
*  She'll be back eventually. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7876.900000000001s)]
*  How much time? [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7880.900000000001s)]
*  Knitting sweaters for the guards. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7882.900000000001s)]

*  I think she did like six months. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7888.900000000001s)]
*  That's real. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7890.900000000001s)]
*  She's not a rat. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7892.900000000001s)]
*  But that's what they used to have back then. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7894.900000000001s)]
*  That was the neighborhood lottery. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7896.900000000001s)]
*  It was called the numbers. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7898.900000000001s)]
*  My grandmother was always talking about the numbers. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7900.900000000001s)]

*  They still do it. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7907.46s)]
*  I bet they do it in Miami. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7909.46s)]
*  They trust the numbers. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7911.46s)]
*  They trust the people running the numbers more than they trust the state lottery. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7913.46s)]
*  It makes so much more sense. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7915.46s)]
*  People win. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7917.46s)]
*  It's a real thing. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7919.46s)]
*  Obviously the mob is getting their cut. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7921.46s)]
*  But it does work. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7923.46s)]
*  I don't understand how it works. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7925.46s)]
*  They come up to you with a binder. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7927.46s)]
*  There's a bunch of things laminated. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7929.46s)]
*  They're like pick one and if we win we'll find you. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7931.46s)]
*  Where? [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7934.02s)]
*  We're at a bar. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7936.02s)]

*  No because they said my uncle used to win all the time. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7946.02s)]
*  You know where they get you? [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7948.02s)]
*  At the airport. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7950.02s)]

*  Because at the airport you're already following instructions. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7954.02s)]
*  At the airport you're used to listening to people. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=7956.02s)]

*  You're like there's this thing that everybody wants. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8394.98s)]
*  And if I could get that thing. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8396.98s)]
*  I would have this insane pleasure. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8398.98s)]
*  Remember the first time you were ever intimate with someone. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8400.98s)]
*  Remember the first time you were ever intimate with someone. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8402.98s)]
*  Like when you were young. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8404.98s)]
*  And you're like this is so wild. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8406.98s)]
*  It's wild. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8408.98s)]
*  It's a weird feeling. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8410.98s)]
*  All of a sudden you become hugely addicted. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8412.98s)]
*  To this wild weird feeling. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8414.98s)]
*  Now imagine if nobody wants to do that to you. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8417.539999999999s)]
*  Now imagine if nobody wants to do that to you. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8419.539999999999s)]
*  Nobody. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8421.539999999999s)]
*  And you write on YouTube and you say you dumb bitch. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8423.539999999999s)]
*  And I'm really smoking that blunt. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8425.539999999999s)]
*  Now here's the question. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8427.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah I'd take it out on a school hallway. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8429.539999999999s)]
*  If robot fuck dolls can fix that. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8431.539999999999s)]
*  Yes we want that. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8433.539999999999s)]
*  Is that what you want? [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8435.539999999999s)]
*  I would rather them fuck. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8437.539999999999s)]
*  Oh wait. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8439.539999999999s)]
*  And then they're not hitting on us because they're fucking the bots. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8441.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah then they're done with you. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8443.539999999999s)]
*  And then you have a girl who can speak five languages and she wears a miniskirt. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8446.1s)]
*  And has no underwear on. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8448.1s)]
*  Yeah go fuck her. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8450.1s)]
*  And she doesn't nag him. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8452.1s)]
*  She wants him to do it. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8454.1s)]
*  She's not like take out the trash. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8456.1s)]
*  But then there's something that they'll always know. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8458.1s)]
*  That they couldn't. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8460.1s)]
*  There's still that thing. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8462.1s)]
*  There's still that disconnect. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8464.1s)]
*  For now but ten years from now when she looks exactly the same. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8466.1s)]
*  And everyone else is ten years older. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8468.1s)]
*  And they're ten years from there. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8470.1s)]
*  And she's exactly the same. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8472.1s)]
*  And this old dude is getting fucking IV infusions. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8474.66s)]
*  And Matthew McConaughey voice. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8476.66s)]
*  He's like that's what I love about my sex robots. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8478.66s)]
*  I keep getting older. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8480.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8482.66s)]
*  Yeah they do stay young. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8484.66s)]
*  Well would you have a sex robot? [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8486.66s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8488.66s)]
*  You know what I think the real problem is? [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8490.66s)]
*  It's not a sex robot. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8492.66s)]
*  The real problem is some sort of brain interface. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8494.66s)]
*  With a computer. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8496.66s)]
*  That allows you to have experiences that aren't real. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8498.66s)]
*  Like the movie Her? [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8500.66s)]
*  Like the sexual experiences. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8503.22s)]
*  I mean any kind of experience. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8505.22s)]
*  Fantasy experiences. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8507.22s)]
*  Be a fucking viking. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8509.22s)]
*  They're going to be able to give you a fake world in your brain. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8511.22s)]
*  You're going to be able to see it. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8513.22s)]
*  Well yeah. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8515.22s)]
*  It does seem like VR is so crazy. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8517.22s)]
*  And it's like I remember the first time I did VR. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8519.22s)]
*  I remember the first thought I had was that it was going to be a problem. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8521.22s)]
*  Because I was like this is cooler than the room I'm in. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8523.22s)]
*  Like I'd rather spend my life in a room. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8525.22s)]
*  Like I'd rather spend my life in a room. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8527.22s)]
*  Like I'd rather spend my life in a room. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8529.22s)]
*  Like I'd rather spend the day in this room. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8531.779999999999s)]
*  And it could also be a room. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8533.779999999999s)]
*  And it could also be a room. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8535.779999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8537.779999999999s)]
*  You could be in a room but just in a better room. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8539.779999999999s)]
*  It feels like the walls feel the same. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8541.779999999999s)]
*  And everything looks the same. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8543.779999999999s)]
*  Oh yes this shit is crazy. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8545.779999999999s)]
*  The grieving mother who got to see her daughter again. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8547.779999999999s)]

*  That's the beginning of the end folks. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8562.34s)]
*  When you can't tell who's real and who's not. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8564.34s)]
*  A computer generated person that's saying amazing things to you. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8566.34s)]

*  I think these things that they're seeing is just crazy. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8586.34s)]
*  I think these things that they're seeing is just like a little bit of haptic feedback in the gloves. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8588.9s)]
*  And then the visual of the VR. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8590.9s)]
*  But I think it's eventually going to be inside your mind. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8592.9s)]
*  But I think it's eventually going to be inside your mind. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8594.9s)]
*  They're going to be able to hijack whatever it is that lets you see [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8596.9s)]
*  Things. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8597.380000000001s)]
*  And how your brain interprets things. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8599.380000000001s)]
*  And hijack that. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8601.380000000001s)]
*  And fill it with other information. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8603.380000000001s)]
*  Fill it with avatar land. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8605.380000000001s)]
*  Fill it with like literal experiences that aren't real. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8607.380000000001s)]

*  But that are more vivid than the experiences that you have. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8611.380000000001s)]
*  And then you're not going to know what's what anymore. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8613.380000000001s)]
*  And then we're doomed. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8615.380000000001s)]
*  I believe that who knows what's real right now anyway that might be already happening. Yeah, but who knows what's real right now according [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8617.38s)]
*  to CIA [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8624.38s)]
*  It's all made up. Anyways. That's what the CIA says yeah CIA.gov the gateway process [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8626.3s)]
*  They said you can just make things up and it happens [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8631.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they said manifestation is very sink and you can astral project the hemisphere sink [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8634.539999999999s)]

*  Yeah [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8647.46s)]
*  What are you saying the CIA does what I found in a red thread like six years ago a red thread [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8648.66s)]
*  It's real Jamie. Well. It's it's from the website. I don't want to ruin this for but [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8654.3s)]
*  Just because it is on the website [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8659.5s)]
*  But that just means that they were investigating it and they have record of investigating it doesn't mean that it is real or is [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8661.259999999998s)]
*  Able to be recreated, but we read it [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8666.38s)]
*  So that means it's real and what is it saying can I see it? Yeah? Yeah, I'll pull it [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8669.06s)]
*  I mean, we've talked about it before on here with other people. I'm [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8673.939999999999s)]
*  Think so too, but it's it's a fan [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8678.3s)]
*  It's like the actual the people who sit in a room and can see stuff [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8680.099999999999s)]
*  They said that the CIA has been having meetings in the Astro realm since 1995 [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8683.179999999998s)]
*  I interviewed one of these guys this shit the biofeedback [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8687.82s)]
*  Yes, the the he tells you exactly how you can do it like he gives you a step-by-step [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8691.46s)]
*  He does the whole you know when you're in third grade, and you do a science fair project [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8697.42s)]
*  And you have the hypothesis and he does the whole fucking thing [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8701.22s)]
*  He thinks he says what he thinks is gonna happen, then he fucking does it he tells you exactly what he used the [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8704.7s)]
*  Frequencies in the music he used he said you have to [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8710.5s)]
*  Meditate and listen to a specific frequency and once your brain connects the right and left [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8713.14s)]
*  It's called a hemisphere sink and that he describes exactly how think your thoughts become physical [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8718.82s)]
*  It was crazy. It's crazy. It was crazy [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8725.539999999999s)]

*  I don't know I believed it because it was on the CIA website in that [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8736.140000000001s)]

*  Oh someone's task to provide an assessment of the gateway experience in terms of its [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8751.34s)]
*  Mechanics and ultimate practicality as I set out to fulfill that tasking it [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8757.960000000001s)]
*  Soon became clear than in order to access the validity and practicality of the process [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8764.160000000002s)]

*  He said that he fucking did the research and he took the fucking time I read this whole thing front to back [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8779.04s)]
*  It took me like four weeks [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8785.2s)]
*  That he specifically went to a bunch of scientists talked to a bunch of people he spent a [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8790.400000000001s)]
*  Really really long time taking this seriously and that fucking all this shit that they're saying is real [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8796.04s)]
*  so that somehow another you can [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8802.560000000001s)]
*  He tells you manifest things with your into reality with your mind with your mind [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8806.640000000001s)]

*  And he tells you how to link the left and right side is it have anything to do with your taint [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8816.76s)]
*  No [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8820.76s)]
*  Your taint has to be a specific size [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=8822.76s)]

*  Refestation of your thoughts like maybe that's just a factor [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9000.38s)]
*  Maybe instead of it being like a primary factor to your success or failure or whatever in life [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9004.539999999999s)]
*  Maybe it is a factor [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9009.619999999999s)]
*  But the other factors that maybe because we want to concentrate on this mystical one that we're missing out [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9011.099999999999s)]
*  There's a bunch of other shit that has to go into play too [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9016.74s)]
*  Like you have to be born in a place where you don't get hit by a drone [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9019.259999999998s)]

*  Because I get before I fall asleep at night I'm like, how is no one questioning this [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9056.42s)]
*  We're all laying down and closing our eyes and letting yeah and then going into this [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9061.86s)]
*  You know, I dream the same place every single night for the last ten years [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9066.82s)]

*  Sometimes and we go to the same place in our and one time I found a fucking video and people were talking about that [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9075.38s)]
*  They were going to the place that I go the same exact beach [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9082.62s)]
*  They said oh, but sometimes I stay in this in this in this hotel [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9085.220000000001s)]
*  That's haunted the one of these rooms is haunted and that's exactly where I go. You are a horror movie [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9089.300000000001s)]

*  There are other people that are gonna say they dream of going to the beach every night [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9108.42s)]
*  But I think that's a big thing. The beach is a huge thing [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9111.58s)]
*  I bet there's people that dream of skiing every night. Well people the beach is always a nice place to go [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9114.22s)]

*  Yeah, but is it the same place there? Well a lot of people that was their beach the beach where you [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9124.1s)]

*  There the water is always really clear and [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9145.74s)]
*  Yeah, there's always a hotel I live in the hotel [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9150.14s)]
*  It's always like I get the nicest hotel and then one of the rooms is haunted [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9153.18s)]
*  So it's like I can't really enjoy myself there. I have a similar dream and a lot of people [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9156.58s)]
*  Yeah, and sometimes like I I'm in a hotel and I'm like, I have to get ready for my flight [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9162.26s)]

*  I had a dream and I'll be right back on the beach that I was on [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9179.1s)]
*  I was on a plane while I had this dream [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9181.66s)]
*  I fell asleep and I dreamed that we were flying through a tunnel and then you couldn't move to the left or to the right [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9183.54s)]
*  The plane had to stay in the center and the pilot was good at doing it [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9190.14s)]
*  But then we're flying through a fucking tunnel that's [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9194.42s)]
*  My eyes were closed and I was dreaming while I was on a plane. I was like, oh my god [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9197.74s)]
*  That's you know, it trips me out. Sometimes I have dreams that I like [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9202.74s)]
*  See like a truck coming to hit me or something [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9206.78s)]
*  And then when I wake I'll wake up from the sound of a honking in real life [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9209.2s)]
*  Like when I wake up a truck is honking at the same time that my dream was having that thing happened [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9214.16s)]
*  How does that happen? That happens to people, right? [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9218.94s)]
*  What do you think is happening when you think about someone they call you Oh [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9221.9s)]
*  I think that we live in a vibrational world. And so if you're thinking about someone [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9225.34s)]
*  That there's a chance you're putting that out and that they're [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9231.78s)]
*  Subconsciously picking up on it. I thought I was just Puerto Rican crazy. I [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9235.66s)]
*  Heard you talking shit [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9241.18s)]
*  I feel it. I feel it in the air [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9243.18s)]
*  Hmm [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9246.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's times I mean you think about someone and then they text you can feel someone looking at you [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9248.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9254.06s)]
*  Statistically, right like they've done tests on that. I think was that Rupert Sheldrake was that one of his yeah [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9255.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think it doesn't feel I don't I don't think it's everybody and I don't think it's all the time [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9262.62s)]
*  It's not like a you always know when people are watching you [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9267.34s)]
*  But it seems like it's more often than chance I think that's how they looked at it [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9269.98s)]
*  Well, you can because also you're in an unnatural environment. So like if they make you stay in a room, okay? [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9275.98s)]
*  You don't know this room. You don't like you know, you're a part of an experiment. You're sitting down like, you know [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9282.74s)]
*  There's a lot of weird factors in there that would interrupt the normal [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9287.3s)]
*  ability and frequency to just feel the world but if you're in your living room and then someone walks in your living room and you're like [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9291.42s)]

*  And then also that I'm in common one and then I'm in high school, and I don't know my locker code [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9411.220000000001s)]

*  Yeah, that's the worst dream. That's not one of mine [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9431.859999999999s)]
*  And then I had to make a decision like am I gonna be a high school dropout or am I gonna do another year of high school? [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9434.5s)]
*  Oh doing another year of high school [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9440.06s)]

*  Yeah [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9451.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's a weird one [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9453.22s)]
*  I did have a friend die and I had a night terror the night that my friend died at the same exact time and I never [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9455.38s)]
*  Had the dream so my dreams are pretty good. They're at the beach all the time [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9461.939999999999s)]
*  So I had a one a one really bad dream that woke me up out of my sleep that someone had killed themselves in front [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9466.06s)]
*  of me and [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9472.619999999999s)]
*  I woke up like instantly crying in the next morning. I got a call the same hour that it happened [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9473.779999999999s)]
*  That's pretty trippy [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9478.98s)]
*  But that could also that's like could also be the same thing as like someone looking at you [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9480.74s)]
*  I could be like that could be a coincidence the night that I had a bad dream [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9484.66s)]
*  It could be it could be the you remember it because of the fact that your friend did that because if you didn't have that [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9488.14s)]
*  You might not even remembered it. No, this is how I know. Yeah, you know I'm saying like how many times do you really accurately remember? [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9496.5s)]
*  Well, this is how I know I was dating a guy and I woke up next to him and he was like [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9503.1s)]
*  What's going on? Because I never do that and I told him about my dream the moment it happened [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9507.539999999999s)]
*  And that's how I yes and that's how I knew because the next day I was like did I tell you about that dream [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9512.74s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, you told me exactly that that happened. Yeah, that's not how he died, but he died [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9517.58s)]
*  Well, they don't know what dreams are really. I mean they they know when people are in REM sleep [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9522.9s)]
*  They know that you should get a certain percentage of REM sleep in order to be like fully recovered and rested and relaxed [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9528.9s)]
*  But there's a lot of weird shit about the consciousness of dreaming [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9536.539999999999s)]
*  Weird shit like because we know the body produces endogenous psychedelic chemicals and is it doing that? [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9540.3s)]
*  Is that what that is? Is that why they're so hard to remember because it's like psychedelic trips like DMT realm. Yeah [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9545.699999999999s)]
*  It's there's probably some kind of state that you go into when you're dreaming [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9552.539999999999s)]
*  You know, it's crazy about DMT is that it smells like morning breath [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9557.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it does whenever I smell it I'm like it smells like more it stinks [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9564.18s)]

*  Yeah [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9584.5s)]
*  I'm not scheming. No, you're not but you're trying to scheme for her. You're like pull it in lady. I like to [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9591.220000000001s)]
*  There's something to that Joe. Yes that it's a dream realm and it smells like morning breath. Well [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9597.72s)]
*  It only smells like that if you burn it, you know, there's other ways of getting it getting it into your body [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9604.32s)]
*  They're doing this long slow IV drip in England now interesting and they're mapping these experiences. This was weird like they're doing long [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9609.0s)]
*  full in DMT experiences where they're going to the same places over and over again and they're encountering very [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9617.8s)]
*  Specific beings. Oh, yeah [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9625.16s)]

*  There's lots of people that have documented this [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9633.92s)]
*  Maybe but what these guys are doing they're doing it for hours and hours at a time in the DMT state because it's doing it [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9637.96s)]
*  Through an IV. So this is like an [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9644.199999999999s)]
*  Completely unusual experience when I did DMT wild told me that the aliens are [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=9646.519999999999s)]

*  No, this is [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10216.22s)]
*  Yeah, the Black Friday Paris did you guys ever see the Paris that they recreated in China [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10223.34s)]
*  That's like virtually like vacant. No, it's why they've made these [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10229.26s)]
*  Now I'm assuming this is real because this was quite a few years ago [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10236.02s)]
*  This was like before CGI was at its level that it's at now cuz now anything can I mean? [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10240.6s)]
*  It's so hard to know what you're looking at, but they used to have this [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10245.58s)]
*  There was a web series where they explored these places [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10250.9s)]
*  I forget who did it but they have these videos of these towns that are like [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10253.38s)]
*  Recreations of other cities in other parts of the world. That's so crazy. Yeah [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10258.1s)]
*  That's China's strange city of Paris. So they have an Eiffel Tower the whole deal [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10264.02s)]
*  So it's like Vegas, but they just but nicer but they they've recreated [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10269.62s)]
*  Created a lot of Paris [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10274.02s)]
*  It's really crazy [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10276.699999999999s)]
*  It's very interesting. I don't know how accurate it is [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10278.74s)]
*  Oh, it's like it's a one-third replica of Diffel Tower. For instance, it's like they expect to 10,000 residents [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10282.619999999999s)]
*  So it's not huge Wow since there's only 10 dot 10% of that. So there's like a thousand people live in there [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10288.14s)]
*  How weird so weird what a weird decision to like make it's kind of cool though. Let's make another Paris [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10293.3s)]
*  It is kind of cool there's something kind of cool about it [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10299.98s)]
*  Like why not fuck it's one hotel open for guests for foreigners as long as you don't pretend with we were the real [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10303.14s)]
*  Everyone's in berets [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10310.06s)]
*  Imagine the Parisians like hey, hey, hey you guys are culturally appropriating [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10314.82s)]
*  They call themselves the originals that Paris actually stole this from us [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10319.74s)]
*  You think maybe they were trying to do like a resort town no matter [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10323.74s)]
*  Maybe yeah, there's an Eiffel Tower in Ohio at Kings Island. Is there really never ever it's on the Brady Bunch back in the [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10327.66s)]

*  Like the France gave it to us, right? Yeah, the French gave it to us [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10348.460000000001s)]

*  Go if you love us [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10729.66s)]
*  You always got to wonder about those kind of deaths though, cuz that's if you were gonna kill somebody that's a good way to pose them [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10732.3s)]
*  That's true. Yeah, cuz nobody wants to get involved in the jerk off [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10737.66s)]
*  God leave him alone. It's like being in someone's diary. Not only that it shames them in death [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10741.019999999999s)]

*  Oh if this gets out to be so embarrassing [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10761.64s)]
*  So it kind of like stifles the possibility of exploring whether or not they were killed [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10763.259999999998s)]
*  It's just me being criminally minded I'm like I was thinking that if you're gonna whack somebody [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10768.539999999999s)]

*  But the weapon wasn't there and they call it a suicide [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEVbHN9ifY&t=10836.22s)]
