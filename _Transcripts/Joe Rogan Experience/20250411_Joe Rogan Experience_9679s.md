# Joe Rogan Experience #2304 - Gary Brecka
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6.0s)]
*  Good to see you my friend. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=10.0s)]
*  Wow, that was fast. Good to see you too, brother. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=15.0s)]
*  That's how we do it. We just go right into it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=17.0s)]
*  You got notes, dude. You're organized. You're a rare guest. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=19.0s)]
*  I actually, you know what, I normally don't bring notes, but I was talking to Cali Means on the way over here, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=22.0s)]
*  and you know, we're really supporting Bobby Kennedy's whole Maha, you know, movement, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=26.0s)]
*  and trying to officially put a committee together to really give him some great talking points [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=31.0s)]
*  and then bring some of the big influencers together to help him message, you know, around the media. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=36.0s)]
*  And I was like, what are some of the wins that we've had in the last week that I don't know about? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=41.0s)]
*  And so he just rattled them off and I just jotted them down. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=44.0s)]
*  What are the wins? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=47.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, so Trump formed this Strong Kids Commission, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=48.0s)]
*  and if you remember when he first got into office, he actually, by executive order, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=51.0s)]
*  he authorized Bobby to do a study with the Health and Human Services to look into the genesis of chronic disease [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=56.0s)]
*  because nobody's talking about it at the National Institute of Health or National Library of Medicine or in our public health policy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=65.0s)]
*  Nobody's talking about what's causing this pandemic. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=72.0s)]
*  Gee, I wonder why they're not talking about it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=74.0s)]
*  Well, I could give you a couple of, I could give you a couple of clues. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=76.0s)]
*  Does it have anything to do with it? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=79.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=80.0s)]
*  You're a conspiracy theorist, dude. You're down the rabbit hole. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=82.0s)]
*  That's my problem. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=85.0s)]
*  You think that just because people get paid, they do things that are shady. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=86.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. That's a weird thing to think. I should stop thinking that way. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=89.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we make $110 billion a year on type 2 diabetes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=92.0s)]
*  They're trying to put that out of business for sure, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah, they don't want that money. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=99.0s)]
*  No, no, no. They're like, hey, Stan, how do we get this off the balance sheet, bro? How do we get rid of it? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=100.0s)]
*  This is stinking up the place. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=103.0s)]
*  So there's a business that relies on people being so disgusting that they get type 2 diabetes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=104.0s)]
*  So bad with their diet, just eating pie and drinking soda until their body just starts to cave in. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah, but don't worry. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=118.0s)]
*  But that's worth how much a year? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=119.0s)]
*  $110 billion, type 2 diabetes alone. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=121.0s)]
*  That's not a lot of money. It's not like that would change anybody's opinions on things. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=124.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, a lot of people could live on that. There's a lot of people that could live on that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=126.0s)]
*  Isn't that funny? A lot of people could live on what's killing other people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=132.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=135.0s)]
*  Isn't that funny? Like a lot of people are buying yachts on what is killing people. Wild. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=136.0s)]
*  Yeah, so the interesting thing is, you know, look at our food stamp program, which is the SNAP program. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=141.0s)]
*  It's one of the biggest subsidies that we have in the government, $120 billion a year. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=146.0s)]
*  $10 billion of that is going to subsidize sodas. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=152.0s)]
*  Well, they need soda. It's an important part of the food pyramid, I think. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=155.0s)]
*  Isn't it in there? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=159.0s)]
*  It's right up there with Lucky Charms, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah, Lucky Charms is right above ground beef. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=162.0s)]
*  Yep, and grass-fed steak. And then you get to the top and you got soda. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=165.0s)]
*  So it's just phenomenal. And then the American Heart Association just ironically comes out in favor of soda in the SNAP program. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=169.0s)]
*  We went over that and we found out that they're paid by Pepsi and by Coca-Cola. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=178.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=185.0s)]
*  It's just so dark. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=186.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=187.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=188.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=189.0s)]
*  The American Heart Association gets money from Coca-Cola and Pepsi. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=190.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I checked into my Airbnb here in Austin, which by the way, love Austin, man. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=193.0s)]
*  I see why you came here. We covered it all on my podcast, so I won't go down that rabbit hole. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=198.0s)]
*  But it truly is, man. People are amazing. Food is amazing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=202.0s)]
*  Went to this little restaurant called The Well, which I love, and they catered all my food. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=206.0s)]
*  But there's like a serious wellness vibe here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=209.0s)]
*  A lot of healthy people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of healthy people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=213.0s)]
*  So I check into the Airbnb and I go into the closet like the owner's closet wasn't locked. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=214.0s)]
*  And I went into the owner's closet. Of course, it's like all Cheerios and cookies and crackers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=221.0s)]
*  And I pulled a couple of bottles of these seed oils out. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=225.0s)]
*  And I did a little post about it because I was like, look at all the heart healthy labels on this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=227.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=233.0s)]
*  And we talked about seed oils last time, but it's, you know, and I get attacked a lot for it for saying that these polyunsaturated fatty acids are bad for you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=234.0s)]
*  But a lot of times it's actually not the plant itself. It's the distance from the plant to the table. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=242.0s)]
*  Right. Can you explain, because you were explaining the other day to us the process that it takes to turn rapeseed oil, which is what canola is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=248.0s)]
*  First of all, it's called canola oil, Joe. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=257.0s)]
*  They said rapeseed was problematic, so they changed the canola oil. I always thought it was corn oil. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=260.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=266.0s)]
*  Corn is good for you. Corn oil must be great for you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=267.0s)]
*  Oh, we're using canola oil. Cool. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=269.0s)]
*  Peanuts. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=271.0s)]
*  Please explain, though, the process because it's so vile. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=272.0s)]
*  It's insane. So rapeseed canola is, you know, a plant. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=276.0s)]
*  Essentially, you put it in a commercial press and it will come out gummy. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=282.0s)]
*  And so to de-gum it, you use something called hexane. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=287.0s)]
*  And hexane, if you go to the National Institute of Health or National Library of Medicine, you'll see that that is a known neurotoxin classified as a neurotoxin, same as fluoride. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=290.0s)]
*  Right. Which is actually fluorosilicic acid. We get to that later. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=298.0s)]
*  But so so we de-gum it with hexane and then you take this de-gummed oil and you heat it to four hundred and five degrees, which turns it rancid. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=301.0s)]
*  I mean, there's no mechanism on Earth for temperatures to reach that much, especially plants to encounter this kind of temperature. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=309.0s)]
*  So now it denatures, it turns rancid. So now you it's putrefied and it smells. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=316.0s)]
*  So now you have to deodorize it. So we deodorize it with sodium hydroxide. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=321.0s)]
*  So we de-gum it with a powerful neurotoxin. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=326.0s)]
*  We heat it to four to five degrees and turn it rancid. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=329.0s)]
*  And then we deodorize it with a very powerful carcinogen. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=331.0s)]
*  And then in some cases, we bleach it and bottle and put it on the shelf. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=334.0s)]
*  You ever look at go to the grocery store and you see the entire grocery aisle. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=337.0s)]
*  It's all these like Wesson oils or vegetable oils, but they're all exactly the same color. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=343.0s)]
*  Like exactly. They have that same beautiful, clear, huge. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=348.0s)]
*  That's not now. Super healthy nature. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=351.0s)]
*  You know, no. Have you squeezed ten thousand watermelons into watermelon juice and put it all on the shelf? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=354.0s)]
*  They would vary a little bit. They would vary a little bit. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah. But there's no variance there. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=362.0s)]
*  And so this is chemically controlled process. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=364.0s)]
*  And it's, you know, again, not it's not back to the polyunsaturated fatty acids per se. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=366.0s)]
*  It's these it's the pro inflammatory process that they cause these foam cells and the the inflammation in our arterial wall, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=371.0s)]
*  which actually calls cholesterol to the site of inflammation. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=379.0s)]
*  And we blame cholesterol for a lot of the heart disease, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=383.0s)]
*  because it's at the scene of the crime. But it rarely pulls the trigger. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=388.0s)]
*  I mean, it's cholesterol is kind of like a fireman. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=392.0s)]
*  It gets called to the fire to put the fire out. Right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=395.0s)]
*  And so the theory that if we had fewer firemen, we'd have less fires is kind of absurd. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=398.0s)]
*  That's the theory in LDL cholesterol. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=405.0s)]
*  It might work in California. They would. I can see them passing that legislation. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=410.0s)]
*  You know what we need? We need less firemen. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=414.0s)]
*  But you know, so the theory that if we push down the firemen, which was called to the site of inflammation, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=417.0s)]
*  meaning we reduce the cholesterol, which was called to the site of inflammation to cause the repair, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=424.0s)]
*  rather than ask what started the fire, that notion is about to be, I think, blown out of the water by by big data. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=429.0s)]
*  I think you're going to see big data, artificial intelligence and early detection in the next five years. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=437.0s)]
*  It's just going to going to circumvent the entire system. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=442.0s)]
*  Do you think there's a possibility of removing food oils from the market? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=445.0s)]
*  I don't think that will ever replace food oils, excuse me. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=451.0s)]
*  Yes, I don't think that will ever replace seed oils. Why not? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=454.0s)]
*  I think what's really interesting is is the chemical processing. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=457.0s)]
*  So another really good thing, and I'm helping to author this this paper with with Kelly Means and a bunch of other folks to present it to Bobby Kennedy in in looking at the genesis of chronic disease. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=462.0s)]
*  Because if you just and I know lots of people have talked about this on your show, so I won't belabor the point. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=474.0s)]
*  But if you look at the spending of four and a half trillion dollars a year right on health care in the United States and then you say, well, what do we lead the world in? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=478.0s)]
*  Well, as of December 6, we were ranked 66 in the world and life expectancy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=486.0s)]
*  We lead the world in morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes, multiple chronic disease in the single biome, meaning not just our population has multiple different chronic diseases, but multiple chronic diseases in the same in the same body. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=490.0s)]
*  Because most people don't just have one autoimmune disease or they're not just hypertensive and diabetic, they're hypertensive, diabetic and hypothyroid with an autoimmune, usually multiple autoimmune. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=504.0s)]
*  We lead the world in infant mortality, maternal mortality. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=513.0s)]
*  And so you got to ask yourself, how's four and a half trillion dollars a year in spending leading to these kinds of consequences? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=516.0s)]
*  And very often it's actually not the food, it's the distance from the food to the table. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=523.0s)]
*  So it it's not necessarily the plant. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=529.0s)]
*  It's what we're doing to process these plants to get them on the table. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=532.0s)]
*  And so I think what you're going to see is these grass guidelines generally regarded as safe, which is essentially how the FDA decides whether or not you can micro poison the population. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=536.0s)]
*  So we are allowed to micro poison the population, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=546.0s)]
*  We're allowed to put certain amounts of pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, preservatives. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=549.0s)]
*  That is a great way of putting it to its micro poisoning. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=555.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=557.0s)]
*  That's really what's happening. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=558.0s)]
*  It's exactly what's happening. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=559.0s)]
*  And a lot of experts will say that dosage determines the poison. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=560.0s)]
*  And that's largely untrue when you talk about cumulative dose toxicity, meaning if I give you this sandwich and this piece of tuna fish and it has a very small safe amount of lead or mercury, it's probably not going to hurt you. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=565.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=582.0s)]
*  But if you don't methylate that metal out of your body and you keep eating that same kind of fish, I mean, nobody got mercury poisoning from a single plant. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=583.0s)]
*  Nobody got mercury poisoning from a single piece of tuna fish. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=589.0s)]
*  What they got mercury poisoning from was continuing to eat the same thing over and over and over and over again. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=591.0s)]
*  And they got a cumulative dose toxicity, which is what a lot of foreign countries use. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=596.0s)]
*  So in other words, I can't just say if I put, you know, one drop of arsenic in this glass, is that is that going to kill you? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=601.0s)]
*  It might make you mildly sick, cause an inflammatory process. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=609.0s)]
*  Maybe it's not going to kill you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=611.0s)]
*  But if you drink one of those five times a day, seven days a week, now you're toxic. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=612.0s)]
*  And that's what's happened to our country. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=617.0s)]
*  We didn't get here quickly. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=618.0s)]
*  We got here by slowly stacking these micro poisons. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=619.0s)]
*  Right. But is it possible to change all of like whatever we use seed oil for? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=623.0s)]
*  Is it possible to swap that out for olive oil or beef tallow or? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=630.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=635.0s)]
*  I know there's some companies doing like Masa makes these great tortilla chips. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=636.0s)]
*  I love Masa. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=640.0s)]
*  Organic corn, tallow. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=641.0s)]
*  Organic corn, beef tallow. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=643.0s)]
*  They taste like it too. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=645.0s)]
*  Like you feel like you're eating food. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=646.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=648.0s)]
*  You know, we talked about those Vandrey chips too. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=649.0s)]
*  Yeah, Vandy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=650.0s)]
*  Vandy chips. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=651.0s)]
*  I love those. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=652.0s)]
*  I do too. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=653.0s)]
*  They're so good. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=654.0s)]
*  It's just potatoes and beef tallow with a little salt. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=655.0s)]
*  And they're fucking, and it tastes like food. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=657.0s)]
*  Like when I eat them, I don't feel like a piece of shit. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=659.0s)]
*  Like if I eat a bag of Doritos, I feel like a fucking loser. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=662.0s)]
*  You know, even while I'm eating, I'm like, oh, you loser. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=665.0s)]
*  Shut up, Popcorn Curries. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=668.0s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=669.0s)]
*  These are delicious. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=670.0s)]
*  You shame yourself. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=671.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=672.0s)]
*  I'm so disappointed in you. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=673.0s)]
*  So would you just replace those or would it require? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=674.0s)]
*  Is it one of those things like there's an issue with factory farming? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=677.0s)]
*  Everybody thinks factory farming is disgusting when it comes to animals. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=680.0s)]
*  It's vile. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=684.0s)]
*  What they do to chickens and pigs. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=685.0s)]
*  But is it possible to give everyone cheeseburgers in food deserts without factory farming? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=688.0s)]
*  Like have we gotten so far ahead of ourselves that we don't have sustainable, regenerative [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=695.0s)]
*  agriculture as an option? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=702.0s)]
*  I don't think so at all. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=703.0s)]
*  So you think that all the foods, all the salad dressings and all the French fries and all [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=705.0s)]
*  the things that are cooked in food oil, we have enough beef tallow, we have enough olive [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=711.0s)]
*  oil, we have enough avocado oil that we could switch all those things out and everything [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=716.0s)]
*  would be great. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=721.0s)]
*  There is no question that we have the capacity to produce these and we have the capacity [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=722.0s)]
*  to produce them now. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=726.0s)]
*  I mean, a lot of these farms don't use the bones from these cattle. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=727.0s)]
*  They don't use the hide from these cattle. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=731.0s)]
*  They don't boil on the collagen from these cattle. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=732.0s)]
*  And they certainly are not making the tallow from the fat from the cattle that are being [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=734.0s)]
*  slaughtered. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=739.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of tallow that's going to waste. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=740.0s)]
*  A lot of tallow, a lot of bone broth, a lot of bones, a lot of cartilage that's entirely [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=741.0s)]
*  going to waste. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=747.0s)]
*  And if you look at a lot of countries, they will use the entire animal. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=748.0s)]
*  They'll boil down the bones. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=751.0s)]
*  They'll use the hide. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=752.0s)]
*  They'll use the bone marrow. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=754.0s)]
*  It's kind of crazy because there's a big market for bone broth. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=756.0s)]
*  There's a big market for beef tallow. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=760.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't they? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=762.0s)]
*  I mean, they're just wasting money. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=764.0s)]
*  I think you have the perception that there's a big market for because you're kind of in [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=765.0s)]
*  a no, right? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=770.0s)]
*  You're probably in the, I hate to use this term, but woke 1%. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=771.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=774.0s)]
*  If you wanted to. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=775.0s)]
*  He's like, did he call me woke? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=776.0s)]
*  It used to be cool. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=779.0s)]
*  When I mean woke 1%, I mean, I hate that word woke. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=781.0s)]
*  Well, you're using it the correct way though. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=784.0s)]
*  You're using it the way African-Americans used to use it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=786.0s)]
*  Black people used to go woke like you're awake. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=789.0s)]
*  I'm woke. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=791.0s)]
*  You can't sneak that stupid shit by me. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=792.0s)]
*  I'm woke. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=794.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=795.0s)]
*  And then the fucking white people took it over and ruined it like a lot of things. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=796.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=800.0s)]
*  Did we? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=801.0s)]
*  Did we fuck that up too? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=802.0s)]
*  Not us, but the ones with blue hair. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=803.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=806.0s)]
*  Now woke means a whole different ballgame. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=807.0s)]
*  Now it's essentially a pejorative. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=809.0s)]
*  They can't even use it in a positive way. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=811.0s)]
*  That's beaten down. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=813.0s)]
*  But I like it because it's kind of like you can just be triggered about anything now. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=815.0s)]
*  So it's so convenient. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=818.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=819.0s)]
*  You know, because I can really silence you if you start out like out intellectualizing me. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=820.0s)]
*  I can just be like, dude, you're triggering me. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=824.0s)]
*  You're hurting my feelings. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=827.0s)]
*  You're triggering me with information. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=829.0s)]
*  I kid you not. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=830.0s)]
*  I've never talked about this. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=831.0s)]
*  I'm going to probably lose half my audience. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=832.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=834.0s)]
*  But I went to Harvard University for this thing, this longevity summit. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=835.0s)]
*  A very good friend of mine. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=840.0s)]
*  I won't mention his name because then I'll give away the event that I was at. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=842.0s)]
*  I called my wife on day two and I was like, babe, I feel like I landed on Mars. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=846.0s)]
*  I go, I got to get out of here. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=852.0s)]
*  And she goes, what is going on? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=854.0s)]
*  I said, I just listened to a panel of PhDs for four hours debate about whether or not a microaggression is something that could happen to you that you don't recognize that was causing a micro trauma. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=856.0s)]
*  The other person didn't realize they were doing, but it was still creating an unsafe environment. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=871.0s)]
*  I think there should be mandatory classes for those people. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=877.0s)]
*  Mandatory jujitsu. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=881.0s)]
*  My head was so twisted. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=882.0s)]
*  Here's your micro trauma. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=883.0s)]
*  Yeah. When they passed the microphone to me, I got so much trouble. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=885.0s)]
*  I won't say his last name, but Daniel, he's still mad at me right now because this they passed the microphone to me. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=888.0s)]
*  They're like, you know, do you have anything to add to the conversation? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=893.0s)]
*  I go, this sounds like a bunch of people. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=895.0s)]
*  This whole this whole panel up here. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=898.0s)]
*  You guys sound like you boarded a spaceship and literally left Mother Earth because I have no idea what you're talking about. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=900.0s)]
*  You are talking about trying to identify something that you by its very nature say you don't know if you have it or you don't. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=907.0s)]
*  So let's just admit that it's a ghost. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=915.0s)]
*  So how are we going to we can't measure it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=917.0s)]
*  We can't find it. We can't prove you have it. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=919.0s)]
*  We can't prove you don't have it. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=920.0s)]
*  So how are we going to treat it? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=922.0s)]
*  What's this culture of victimization and the monetization? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=924.0s)]
*  It's like there's a there's status in victimization. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=928.0s)]
*  You know, that's the thing. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=932.0s)]
*  They've essentially made it like a virtue to be a victim. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=934.0s)]
*  So you're looking for little things that have possibly I believe there's a microaggression. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=938.0s)]
*  I think I felt it possibly rolled his eyes. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=943.0s)]
*  I mean, that is going to haunt me. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=946.0s)]
*  I need therapy now. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=950.0s)]
*  I think he might have rolled his eyes. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=952.0s)]
*  And that's absolutely acceptable. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=954.0s)]
*  That is microaggression. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=955.0s)]
*  Like maybe rolling your eyes like you say something to me and I go, OK, and I leave. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=957.0s)]
*  Oh, my God, that was a microaggression. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=961.0s)]
*  Yeah. What I just did going, OK, that's the microaggression is you're kind of off the hook because if you didn't intentionally create the microaggression, I just perceived it as depends on who I am. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=962.0s)]
*  If I'm a white heterosexual cis male, then you're screwed. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=973.0s)]
*  I got problems. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=977.0s)]
*  Then you're screwed. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=978.0s)]
*  So anyway, back to the food supply. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=979.0s)]
*  We took it took a U-turn there for a second. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=980.0s)]
*  What's really interesting is if you just take a very 30,000 foot view and you say, let's let's just look at the broad strokes on the Blue Zone research, right? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=984.0s)]
*  There's no continuity between diets in these Blue Zones. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=993.0s)]
*  So it's not keto, paleo, pescetarian, vegan, vegetarian, you know, raw food, Atkins. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=996.0s)]
*  It's it's whole food. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1004.0s)]
*  Just what you were just saying. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1005.0s)]
*  Whole food and a lot of healthy lifestyle. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1006.0s)]
*  Whole food. Well, the two things that were non non-interchangeable were sense of purpose in community and activity until later in life. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1009.0s)]
*  So you didn't have any of the Blue Zones where people didn't feel a sense of purpose and community in life. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1014.0s)]
*  In fact, there were no no such things as assisted care living facilities. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1019.0s)]
*  You know, the assisted care in those countries as mom and dad moved back in with kids until until the day that they right till the day that they die. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1023.0s)]
*  And there's a lot to be said for that because maybe grandma's only purpose is to go out and get vegetables for dinner that night. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1031.0s)]
*  But she has a purpose. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1038.0s)]
*  And she's a part of the community. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1040.0s)]
*  And she's not locked up in a home with a bunch of people don't really care about her. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1041.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, we knew something in the mortality space because I used to study mortality and mortality research. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1045.0s)]
*  And we knew that if you wanted to cut somebody's life expectancy in half at any age, and I mean at any age, you put them in isolation. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1052.0s)]
*  So as soon as you create isolation, you dramatically reduce, if not half the life expectancy. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1059.0s)]
*  Now, later in life, we would call this broken heart syndrome, caregiver syndrome. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1068.0s)]
*  And these were actually very valid syndrome. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1073.0s)]
*  So if we actually were doing the life expectancy on an elderly spouse who was still applying for insurance or we were looking at what's called a second to die claim on life insurance policy and one spouse had passed away, we would dramatically reduce the life expectancy of the second spouse. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1075.0s)]
*  And the reason why that's important is I think that people don't realize that we are actually being isolated in plain sight. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1091.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, we are trying to create connection through our phones. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1097.0s)]
*  We're trying to create connection through social media. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1101.0s)]
*  And these are not human connections. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1104.0s)]
*  In fact, you know, if you look at the rates of depression, suicide, suicidal ideation, obesity, you know, chronic mental illness, and I think we actually have a chronic lack of mental fitness, not necessarily a mental illness crisis in this country. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1106.0s)]
*  And if you look at the skyrocketing rates of these conditions and how they are creeping into younger and younger and younger generations, you got nine year olds being treated for depression now. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1120.0s)]
*  All right. So what's happening? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1128.0s)]
*  What's happening is isolation in plain sight. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1132.0s)]
*  You know, we don't problem solve anymore. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1135.0s)]
*  We don't have communities with our friends anymore. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1137.0s)]
*  We actually don't build social connections. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1139.0s)]
*  We've lost our connection to to Mother Nature. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1141.0s)]
*  You know, that's why I like going out to my place in Colorado is probably like you like bow hunting and just an old school connection to Mother Nature. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1144.0s)]
*  And how freaking good do you feel? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1151.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very, very good. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1152.0s)]
*  I really wish I lived in nature. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1154.0s)]
*  I'd really like to be living in the woods again. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1156.0s)]
*  I'm working on it, man. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1158.0s)]
*  Would you say you're trying to get something outside of town like I think that's the move. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1159.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think nature is a vitamin. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1163.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1167.0s)]
*  I think it's a mental health vitamin. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1168.0s)]
*  I think there's something about being in nature. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1171.0s)]
*  There's a feeling you get, especially when your phone doesn't work and you get out there and you look at your phone like zero bars. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1173.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1178.0s)]
*  And you're out there and like real woods. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1179.0s)]
*  It's just like you just feel better. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1181.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1183.0s)]
*  I feel like more tuned in your birds and branches snap and things going on coyotes and it's like, God damn, it feels good. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1184.0s)]
*  We have this place in Colorado. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1191.0s)]
*  My wife and I was she's been going to for 35 years since she was a little little girl. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1193.0s)]
*  We got together 10 years ago. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1197.0s)]
*  She started bringing me and my family out there and her father's got 10 acres or her uncle's got 10 acres. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1199.0s)]
*  And then this 50 acre piece came on the market. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1205.0s)]
*  So we we bought it. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1207.0s)]
*  We're building these old school, like really authentic log cabins on there. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1208.0s)]
*  And I write about this all the time because in Miami, I have this really fancy place and I've got all this fancy equipment, you know, red light, derby beds, hyperbaric, hydrogen beds, all this stuff. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1213.0s)]
*  But I'll go out to this Colorado home, put on a 20 pound rucksack. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1224.0s)]
*  I know you do 150 pound rucksack, so I feel like a complete most of the time I do 45. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1229.0s)]

*  And I carry two 50 pound kettlebells. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1296.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1298.0s)]
*  No, I really I'm not even telling the rest of the short burst category. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1299.0s)]
*  Not like long distance. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1303.0s)]
*  You know, it's just I just do it to tax my system. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1305.0s)]
*  Well, I do farmers carries. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1308.0s)]
*  I do that, too. Yeah. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1310.0s)]
*  Farmer's carries. I actually like that. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1311.0s)]
*  That's what I mean by that. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1313.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think farmers carries like suitcase carries are actually better. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1314.0s)]
*  You know, what? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1317.0s)]
*  One hand. Oh, one hand. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1319.0s)]
*  Yeah, because then it makes you balance on the other side and then you swap it out to the other side. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1321.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1325.0s)]
*  Stabilization. Yes. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1326.0s)]
*  I've heard from a lot of people that it's instead of actually better. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1327.0s)]
*  Actually, that makes a lot of sense. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1331.0s)]
*  Yeah, because, you know, you're not just you're not just load bearing the spine. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1332.0s)]
*  So I don't squatter. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1336.0s)]
*  But farmers carries are amazing, too. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1337.0s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with it. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1338.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I do a lot of farmers carries. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1339.0s)]
*  But I'll put on this 20 pound rucksack, go out by myself, put a sidearm, you know, in my, you know, vest and go. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1340.0s)]
*  It's just kind of funny. I took a picture of myself in the woods the other day. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1346.0s)]
*  Post on social media and had sidearm people in bananas. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1349.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to get eaten by a mountain lion. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1353.0s)]
*  It does happen. It probably won't happen. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1356.0s)]
*  But guess what? If I have a gun, it's not going to feel. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1359.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's never going to happen. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1362.0s)]
*  I just fucking great video of a bow hunter who is being attacked by a mountain lion. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1363.0s)]
*  And the mountain lion is like creeping up on him slowly. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1368.0s)]
*  He's like, hey, get back, get back, get back. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1371.0s)]
*  And you see the thing lock on him and start closing in. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1374.0s)]
*  It's like 15 feet away. And then bang. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1377.0s)]
*  And then you see the thing twitching. It's got a hole in its face. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1380.0s)]
*  He was a bow hunter. He had a sidearm. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1383.0s)]
*  That's why he had a pistol on him. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1386.0s)]
*  Yeah, it happens in Colorado. I mean, bear attacks. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1387.0s)]
*  I mean, it fucking happens. Bear attacks are fairly rare in Colorado. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1389.0s)]
*  It's only when you cross the apparently if you just come upon the cubs and the mother. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1393.0s)]
*  The real issue is not the bears that are in Colorado, though. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1398.0s)]
*  The real issue is the bears in Wyoming and Montana, brown bears, brown bears, which you have to worry about. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1401.0s)]
*  Black bears, not as much. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1407.0s)]
*  But but occasionally like a big black bear will will go after people. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1409.0s)]
*  Yeah. But anyway, I take a sidearm and I'll march around in there. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1413.0s)]
*  But but when I'm done, I feel like I took a limitless bill. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1416.0s)]
*  Just something I totally agree with you. Something out there. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1420.0s)]
*  And I get this little squirrel. So funny. I mean, I leave my house and start climbing up in the woods. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1422.0s)]
*  I have this little four mile kind of track and there's a squirrel. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1426.0s)]
*  I don't know if it'll be there this year, but every year that I go out there and he and he barks at me. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1430.0s)]
*  Right. And he kind of growls. It doesn't sound like a squirrel. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1435.0s)]
*  Sounds like a little bark. And then he chews acorns off and grabs them with both hands and throws them down on me. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1438.0s)]
*  It's so funny. And he'll follow me from limb to limb. I shit you not. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1444.0s)]
*  And I look forward to seeing him every day. Like I feel like he's pissed off. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1448.0s)]
*  Maybe it's a sign of love. I don't know. It's definitely pissed off. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1452.0s)]
*  He doesn't love you. Yeah. Somebody probably hunted one of his family. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1455.0s)]
*  I'll take a sidearm. People do hunt squirrels. You know, they eat them. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1459.0s)]
*  But but in case, man, I feel I feel amazing. So but you know, you're right. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1463.0s)]
*  You know, at some point we have the capacity to replace these these oils. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1468.0s)]
*  We actually have a way to get, you know, back away from industrial farming and get back to local farming. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1475.0s)]
*  You know, there's a I have a very good friend named Alfie Oaks and he owns one of the one of the more profitable grocery stores in America. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1482.0s)]
*  It's in Naples, Florida, called Seed to Table. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1488.0s)]
*  And he took me out by helicopter one time and we hopped around to a bunch of his organic fields. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1491.0s)]
*  He's got thousands of acres in the middle of the state of Florida. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1497.0s)]
*  And he showed me how he's not only able to grow produce for less money than he would organically, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1500.0s)]
*  for less money than he would grow it if he had to use herbicides and pesticides and chemicals. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1509.0s)]
*  He's able to pick it at nine o'clock in the morning and have it on the grocery store shelf by two o'clock in the afternoon. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1516.0s)]
*  And I watched the whole process go down thousands and thousands of these acres. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1521.0s)]
*  And, you know, whiteflies are the the pest flies are trying to avoid instead of spraying for these whiteflies. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1524.0s)]
*  What they do is they just use this reflective cellophane. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1530.0s)]
*  They run it down the rows of crops and it creates this reflection and it scatters them to the woods. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1533.0s)]
*  And so now the whiteflies are not eating the crops. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1539.0s)]
*  There's no herbicide. There's no pesticide sprayed on these. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1542.0s)]
*  There's no no preservatives. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1544.0s)]
*  His his team picks this stuff by nine o'clock in the morning. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1547.0s)]
*  It goes into a processing center and by processing, I mean, it gets washed. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1550.0s)]
*  That's it. And then it's on a truck and it's on the shelf by two o'clock in the afternoon. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1553.0s)]
*  So you can grab a strawberry in this grocery store and eat it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1557.0s)]
*  And it was growing at nine a.m. that morning. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1561.0s)]
*  And there are, you know, there are mechanisms for us to do that. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1563.0s)]
*  Yes, I get some some stuff needs to be shipped and stored. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1565.0s)]
*  But most regenerative farming practices are not only green and good for the environment, they're economically feasible. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1571.0s)]
*  They actually make economic sense. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1577.0s)]
*  And, you know, when he talks about the fact that we've been spraying some of these fields for so many decades with or so many years with these herbicides and insecticides, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1579.0s)]
*  that there is not a pest for in some cases hundreds of miles, but we are still spraying for those pests. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1591.0s)]
*  He said you got to start to question what the motivation is. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1599.0s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah, probably financial and financial. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1601.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's we're talking about you said something earlier. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1606.0s)]
*  Interesting that you think it's not what it was the term that you used. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1610.0s)]
*  It's not a mental health problem. It's a lack of mental strength, mental fitness, mental fitness. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1615.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you think about it, you know, those hydrogens. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1621.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. You want to maybe come on. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1624.0s)]
*  I love these. I'm addicted. I love these too. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1626.0s)]
*  Yeah. Explain to people what these are. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1631.0s)]
*  So hydrogen gas. I mean, this is probably my favorite biohack in the world because it'll cost you about a dollar a day. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1634.0s)]
*  These are called H2 tab and get them at drink H2 tab.com. You can actually read the science on it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1640.0s)]
*  I think there's two people in the world now. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1647.0s)]
*  I mean, those that have read the science and take hydrogen gas during hydrogen water and those that don't or just haven't read the science because hydrogen gas, first of all, is a it's it's the lightest element in the universe. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1650.0s)]
*  It's also the most prevalent element in the universe. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1662.0s)]
*  Ten percent of your body weight is hydrogen. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1664.0s)]
*  I think, in fact, if you took hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, that's 96 percent of your mass. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1666.0s)]
*  OK, those four elements. So hydrogen is about 10 percent of your body weight. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1671.0s)]
*  And hydrogen is not just an antioxidant. It's a selective antioxidant. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1676.0s)]
*  Right. So if you look at oxidative stressors like nitric oxide or superoxide or hydrogen peroxide. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1681.0s)]
*  OK, so all of these these these oxidative stressors, they can be good in certain amounts. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1688.0s)]
*  You need a certain amount of nitric oxide in your body. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1694.0s)]
*  But but too much nitric oxide is bad. Too much hydrogen peroxide bad. Too much superoxide is bad. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1696.0s)]
*  So if you were to take an antioxidant like vitamin C and take very, very high doses of antioxidants, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1702.0s)]
*  this can be very bad for you because you're suppressing too much oxidation in the body. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1709.0s)]
*  You're actually suppressing these oxidative stressors too much. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1715.0s)]
*  Hydrogen, on the other hand, uses the body's homeostatic process to suppress inflammation. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1719.0s)]
*  So in other words, it it works through something called the Nrf2 pathway. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1727.0s)]
*  It affects a protein called Nrf2, which moves into the DNA, binds to the DNA, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1731.0s)]
*  and then the DNA spits out the instructions for catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1737.0s)]
*  So in other words, you're actually using the body's regulatory system to actually control inflammation [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1744.0s)]
*  instead of externally trying to control inflammation. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1750.0s)]
*  And then the second thing it does is it targets the only oxidative free radical that I think all of the science points to as [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1753.0s)]
*  which is hydroxyl radical having no use in the body. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1760.0s)]
*  So it selectively targets that and regulates the rest of the inflammatory process by using the body's homeostasis. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1764.0s)]
*  So I guess a very long winded way of saying that hydrogen gas can go anywhere in the body. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1771.0s)]
*  It reduces inflammation, improves circulation, improves memory. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1778.0s)]
*  There's a really interesting study published on the Journal of Experimental Gerontology, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1782.0s)]
*  and it was published in November of 2021. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1788.0s)]
*  And most of these clinical research studies, they'll look at younger populations, like healthier younger populations. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1791.0s)]
*  But this actually looked at a six month study on hydrogen water versus non-hydrogen water in 70 year old and older folks. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1798.0s)]
*  And they use something called Tet2 to measure methylation. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1806.0s)]
*  They measured cognitive function, sleep scores, sit-stand ratios, how well they're able to sit and stand, telomere lengths and their chromosomes. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1810.0s)]
*  And the really fascinating thing about this study is it was done during COVID. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1818.0s)]
*  So these seniors were basically imprisoned. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1822.0s)]
*  So they were not mobile. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1825.0s)]
*  And the only difference between the groups that they controlled for was the presence of hydrogen water. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1828.0s)]
*  At the end of this six month period during the lockdown, the control group had lost 11 percent in their telomeres. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1835.0s)]
*  The non-control group had gained 4 percent. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1845.0s)]
*  They had better short term recall, better cognitive scores, better circulation, improvement in cardiac markers, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1848.0s)]
*  improvement in inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1855.0s)]
*  I think it's the greatest biohack on earth. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1858.0s)]
*  That and like some sea salt and some amino acids like a perfect amino. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1861.0s)]
*  I mean, just covering your bases. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1865.0s)]
*  I think those are those are your foundational basics for for optimal. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1867.0s)]
*  And it's like delicious. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1871.0s)]
*  Comes in good flavors and it's easy to drink. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1873.0s)]
*  It's like a pain free thing that you can do. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1877.0s)]
*  You know, you can bathe in it too. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1880.0s)]
*  You can actually bathe in hydrogen gas. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1882.0s)]
*  How many tabs you put in the water? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1884.0s)]
*  You can you can actually put. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1885.0s)]
*  Oh, it's called a hydrogen bomb, which just looks like a big bath bomb. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1887.0s)]
*  It just creates hydrogen gas. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1890.0s)]
*  It's elemental magnesium do for you when you bathe in it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1891.0s)]
*  It goes right transdermal, goes right through the skin. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1894.0s)]
*  So remember, hydrogen is the smallest, lightest element that we know of. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1896.0s)]
*  Right. So it will go right transdermal. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1900.0s)]
*  And these hydrogen gas will form in between water molecules. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1902.0s)]
*  So water molecules H2O. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1907.0s)]
*  But hydrogen gas can actually exist outside of the water molecule. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1909.0s)]
*  And when you put excess hydrogen gas into the water, it will go right transdermal. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1912.0s)]
*  And, you know, I have two of these baths at my house. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1919.0s)]
*  I never talk about it like on social media. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1922.0s)]
*  So I guess I'm about to talk about it now. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1924.0s)]
*  But I have literally put people into these tubs. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1926.0s)]
*  I'm kidding you not crippled with arthritis and they will skip out of my unit like they won the lottery. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1929.0s)]
*  It's incredible. I mean, so transdermal reduction of inflammation in joints from these hydrogen bombs. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1936.0s)]
*  How long does it last or from a hydrogen bath? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1944.0s)]
*  You can get these you can get these machines. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1947.0s)]
*  I mean, one for your house about seventy five hundred bucks, eight thousand bucks. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1948.0s)]
*  They make some that make nanoparticles or nanobubbles, which are about one five hundredth the diameter of a human pore. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1952.0s)]
*  So if you run these things on your face, it'll actually push all the sebum out of your skin. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1959.0s)]
*  It'll get rid of dandruff, psoriasis, eczema. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1962.0s)]
*  If you have any kind of inflammatory condition like knees, hips, shoulder, rotator cuff, arthritis, low back, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1966.0s)]
*  bathing and hydrogen gas can be one of the most therapeutic things that you do. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1972.0s)]
*  Really? Can you add it to a cold plunge? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1976.0s)]
*  You can add it to a cold plunge. And what's interesting about adding it to a cold. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1979.0s)]
*  In fact, I use this cold life cold plunge and I've got these guys trying to see if we can incorporate the hydrogen gas into the cold plunge. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1982.0s)]
*  So where the where the motor pulls the cold water out, it's going to send it into a hydrogen generator and then push it back into the tub. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=1992.0s)]
*  Because as the temperature drops in water, you can saturate more gas. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2000.0s)]
*  So so a 48 degree quote me exactly on this, but a 48 degree cold plunge will hold about twice as much gas as a hundred and two degree, you know, warm tub. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2004.0s)]
*  So if you were like to take a warm bath. Right. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2016.0s)]
*  So you're going to be cold plunging for three to six minutes every day. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2019.0s)]
*  Or, you know, that's what you and I do. You might as well be in there with hydrogen gas. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2021.0s)]
*  And so I'm I'm I'm working with these guys from Gold Life to see if we can plumb these hydrogen generators. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2025.0s)]
*  And basically it's it creates the hydrogen gas by by taking distilled water and breaking distilled water apart and then throwing the gas into the water. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2031.0s)]
*  And it is noticeably different when you bathe in this gas or not. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2040.0s)]
*  Like I had Sean Ryan over to my house before podcast one time and you know, he's all banged up from being a Navy SEAL. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2046.0s)]
*  And he's got nips and bibbles all over his body. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2054.0s)]
*  And he just thought it was really weird because I was like, dude, you got to get my bathtub. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2056.0s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by me undies. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2063.0s)]
*  Some things are complicated. The human mind, relationships, life. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2066.0s)]
*  But what's not complicated is looking and feeling good with me undies underwear. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2069.0s)]
*  If you're a longtime listener, you've probably heard me talk about me undies before. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2073.0s)]
*  I swear by them. I wear their stuff all the time and I can't recommend them enough. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2077.0s)]
*  Seriously, their underwear feels good while giving me the support that I need. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2081.0s)]
*  And I can't mention me undies without talking about their contoured pouch and ball caddy. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2085.0s)]
*  Confidence is key and you're guaranteed to feel that with a pair of these. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2090.0s)]
*  They're comfortable, supportive and make you look good. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2094.0s)]
*  Or go with another one of their briefs. There's plenty to choose from. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2097.0s)]
*  I promise you, you can't go wrong. I like everything I've gotten from them so far. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2100.0s)]
*  Plus me undies has even more options when it comes to sizes, colors and prints. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2104.0s)]
*  You're bound to find something you like. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2109.0s)]
*  Go classic with a pair of black or blue underwear or mix it up with a fun print. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2111.0s)]
*  If you're a coffee fan like me, they've got a hilarious fuck off e-print. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2116.0s)]
*  Now, as much as I've been talking about their underwear, me undies also has some great loungewear. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2120.0s)]
*  It's made with the same soft material so you can be comfortable head to toe, which I don't know about you guys, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2125.0s)]
*  but if I'm kicking back at home, I want to be wearing something I can relax in. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2131.0s)]
*  They're also great for a workout. Try them out yourself. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2135.0s)]
*  If you're not totally satisfied with your first pair of underwear, it's on me undies. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2138.0s)]

*  He's talked about it before. Sean, big shout out, brother. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2166.0s)]
*  But he was like, he's like, dude, I just met you, man. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2170.0s)]
*  I go, no, it's OK. I'm not going to get in there with you. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2175.0s)]
*  I said, I'm going to be honest with you. I said, dude, I gave him a fair shorts. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2180.0s)]
*  So because I was like, do you does anything on your body hurt? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2184.0s)]
*  Did your knees, your hips, your shoulders, is anything hurt? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2187.0s)]
*  He's like, dude, fucking everything in my body hurts. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2190.0s)]
*  So I was like, get in there, man. And I put him in there for 25 minutes. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2192.0s)]
*  He said it was like the first time he had slept eight hours and woken up without pain in probably 15 years. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2197.0s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. John Jones, same thing. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2203.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, John Jones has been very public about when I, you know, working with me. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2205.0s)]
*  I've been talking to him a little while, but right before his last fight, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2210.0s)]
*  I brought him one of these hydrogen machines to bathe in. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2215.0s)]
*  And we just set up the tub at his house and we ran hydrogen gas into the tub. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2219.0s)]
*  So we would do red light therapy. He would drink hydrogen water and he would bathe in this hydrogen gas. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2225.0s)]
*  And it was about 15 or 20 days after I kind of parachuted into his camp and then set all this up that he text me. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2233.0s)]
*  He was like, holy shit, brother, I can't believe I'm, you know, I'm out of pain. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2241.0s)]
*  I'm adding a six day to my training routine. I'm waking up, not in pain, you know, sleeping better. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2244.0s)]
*  So it's it's really incredible what hydrogen gas can do in the body. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2252.0s)]
*  And it don't take my word for it. I mean, there's there actually is a really interesting study published by Dr. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2256.0s)]
*  LeBaron, Tyler LeBaron. He's a PhD. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2261.0s)]
*  And he actually I think his PhD is in molecular hydrogen. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2264.0s)]
*  So I should tease him about where his life went wrong that he got a PhD in hydrogen. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2267.0s)]
*  But where did you bang a left that you decided when you get a PhD in hydrogen? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2271.0s)]
*  But he published a study looking at electrolyzed alkaline water. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2277.0s)]
*  And and when they remove the hydrogen gas, all of the benefits of alkaline water went away. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2284.0s)]
*  So the benefits from alkaline water are coming from the excess presence of hydrogen gas. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2293.0s)]
*  And even when you add hydrogen gas to regular water, it will drop the R.P. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2299.0s)]
*  It will make the oxidative reduction potential negative. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2308.0s)]
*  So it has more of a capacity to donate electrons. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2311.0s)]
*  So I just think it's a phenomenal discovery. And it's dirt. It's dirt cheap. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2315.0s)]
*  When you were telling me that these bottles, water bottles that generate hydrogen, they're great in the beginning, but that over time, they deteriorate. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2319.0s)]
*  Does this with the same issue happen with the hydrogen generators that you would use for the coal plunges? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2327.0s)]
*  You know, they're a lot more robust. They're commercial generators. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2334.0s)]
*  So they're they're not actually working under pressure. So the water flows through these. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2336.0s)]
*  So a lot of the ways that you create high part per million hydrogen gas in these water bottles and I I actually just want I'm about to to put a press release out about it. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2341.0s)]
*  I actually just want a 16 million dollar civil judgment against a fake hydrogen water bottle company that used my name, image and likeness to run a bunch of ads and sold tens of millions of dollars in these bottles. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2353.0s)]
*  But essentially at the bottom of these bottles, there's something called a proton exchange membrane. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2366.0s)]
*  And this proton exchange membrane comes in contact with the with the water through electrolysis and it creates the hydrogen gas. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2370.0s)]
*  The problem with these bottles is that this electrolysis process, if you put tap water in there and use chlorine, can actually create chlorine gas. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2379.0s)]
*  You can also create something called hypochloric acid. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2388.0s)]
*  So what happens is over time, the bottles that I tested, because I used to be a huge fan of these bottles and I carried them everywhere. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2391.0s)]
*  And I would notice that that it didn't bubble as much, you know, four or five months after I, you know, had this had the bottle. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2399.0s)]
*  And so I sent it to be tested. And lo and behold, you know, these proton exchange membranes break down over time. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2408.0s)]
*  So the first time you use the bottle, you're getting very high part per million hydrogen before five months later, you're getting almost none. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2416.0s)]
*  Maybe six months later, you might be getting zero. Could you just swap out the membrane and continue to use the same bottle? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2421.0s)]
*  Or would you have to use a new bottle? They don't send you a new proton exchange membrane. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2426.0s)]
*  Now, some of them you can screw off the bottom and they theoretically could send it to you. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2431.0s)]
*  But they're expensive. They're like two hundred fifty three hundred bucks. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2434.0s)]
*  I mean, an H2 tab like a hydrogen tablet will cost you a buck a day. Right. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2437.0s)]
*  And so it gives you more and it gives you a higher part per million than almost all those bottles. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2442.0s)]
*  And it's consistent. It's high. It's high dose hydrogen gas that's exactly consistent. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2447.0s)]
*  So every single time I put one of those tablets in the water, it's just it's a consistent dose of hydrogen gas. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2453.0s)]
*  And I used to get a lot of shit online because I was promoting these bottles so heavily because I believed in them tremendously. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2459.0s)]
*  But the average person's like out of pocket, two hundred fifty three hundred bucks. Right. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2465.0s)]
*  So this is a lot more financially cost effective. Yeah. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2470.0s)]
*  So with the cold plunge thing, you're saying so because a commercial unit, it would work differently and it'd be more robust. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2473.0s)]
*  Well, it's not using pressure. OK. Right. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2480.0s)]
*  So it's it's circulating through this machine and it's creating, you know, using electrolysis and creating the hydrogen gas going back to the tub because you don't need you're not trying to drink a therapeutic dose. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2483.0s)]
*  You're trying to bathe in a dose. You don't need as high part per million. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2495.0s)]
*  So you don't need the pressure. But the really cool thing is because if you do it in a cold plunge and when I pull this off, I'll send you one. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2498.0s)]
*  If you do it in a cold plunge, because, you know, as the temperature drops, the more you can do, dissolve more gas in that volume of liquid. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2506.0s)]
*  So ideally, you would have the hydrogen generator outside of your cold plunge, let your cold plunge run and fill with hydrogen gas. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2514.0s)]
*  And then you're getting in there for the inflammatory response anyway, a lot of times, plus the brown fat activation and cold shark protein release and all peripheral vasoconstriction, all of that. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2523.0s)]
*  But you would now be exposing yourself to very high doses of hydrogen gas. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2532.0s)]
*  You'd feel amazing getting out of there. When I when I bathe in that hydrogen gas. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2540.0s)]
*  So my wife Sage had a really bad car accident right right before we met 10 years ago and she severely damaged her spine to her L5S1 and ended up having to have a spinal fusion. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2544.0s)]
*  And so her L5S1 is fused. And even though she's thin, she's fit. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2557.0s)]
*  She she gets a lot of low back pain and when her back pain flares up, there's no chance she's sleeping. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2562.0s)]
*  But when we put her into that hydrogen nanobath, I mean, 25 minutes in there, she sleeps like a little baby. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2569.0s)]
*  And it's very calming to it's that shifting you from that sympathetic state that kind of fight or flight to that parasympathetic state of rest and digest. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2575.0s)]
*  You can feel that if the effects of that hydrogen gas when it goes transdermal and starts to relax you, you know, feels feels good. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2584.0s)]
*  Well, it seems like the more effective way is to do it in a warm tub, though, because you can stay in there for longer. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2593.0s)]
*  So you'd get more exposure. So you would get you would get less hydrogen, but more exposure than the three minute cold plunge. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2598.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I this is where, you know, I like to see some data, which I don't have. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2605.0s)]
*  So I do know that if you if the water is colder, you're going to you're going to dissolve more gas because you're so you're going to have a higher part per million in cold water than you are in warm water. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2611.0s)]
*  But then you got to look at what's happening in warm water. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2619.0s)]
*  You're probably having your pores are dilated. You've got a little vasodilation. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2621.0s)]
*  You probably have better surface circulation in your skin. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2625.0s)]
*  So you might be actually carrying more of the hydrogen through the skin. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2627.0s)]
*  I don't know. Versus when you're in a cold plunge, you're going to have that peripheral vasoconstriction. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2630.0s)]
*  You're still going to get hydrogen through the skin because it's a higher to higher dose. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2636.0s)]
*  But I don't have any clinical data to say that one is better than the other. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2641.0s)]
*  Have you done the cold plunge hydrogen? Oh, yeah, 100 percent. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2646.0s)]
*  I mean, I did it with a bath bomb. I did it. I didn't do it with a bath bomb. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2649.0s)]
*  I did it with the one in my house that actually have three of these machines. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2652.0s)]
*  I did it with one of my house that recirculates it. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2657.0s)]
*  You throw a hose over one side and it sucks the water out of your cold plunge. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2659.0s)]
*  And then you throw a hose over the other side and it puts the hydrogen gas back in. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2664.0s)]
*  How long does the process take to hydrogen? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2668.0s)]
*  I let it run for like 15 or 20 minutes because I wanted it to be really saturated. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2671.0s)]
*  And the water looks kind of milky. In fact, I did it. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2675.0s)]
*  I had Laura Trump over for we shot this Fox News event on her for her show for her large show. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2678.0s)]
*  And I did it for us to do this cold plunge shoot. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2688.0s)]
*  I added the hydrogen gas to the to the cold plunges before we got in there. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2692.0s)]
*  Felt amazing getting out of there. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2696.0s)]
*  Now I'm trying to actually plummet right into the cold plunge. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2698.0s)]
*  So it's just in line. So it just runs either all the time or I can turn a valve and turn the hydrogen gas on and have the gas go into the go into the cold plunge. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2702.0s)]
*  So that's the next thing. But right now for people, you can just go get these hydrogen bath bombs. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2711.0s)]
*  You can get these hydrogen bath bombs. Where would you get one of those? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2717.0s)]
*  Drink H2 Tab. Oh, so you have to drink H2 Tab.com. OK. All right. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2720.0s)]
*  Yeah. If you go there and get the bath bomb, I mean, try it. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2725.0s)]
*  I mean, just throw one of those bath bombs in there and and feel how much different your body feels when you're bathing in hydrogen gas. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2728.0s)]
*  It's it's incredible. I really feel like it is one of the best hacks that so few people are using. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2737.0s)]
*  I mean, so many people are in any inflammatory. So many people are suffering from inflammation, not just neural inflammation in the brain, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2746.0s)]
*  but nonspecific markers of inflammation like C, reactive protein, homocysteine that are causing all kinds of havoc. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2752.0s)]
*  I mean, you think about the fact that about 70 percent of our circulation is not done by our heart. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2759.0s)]
*  Our heart circulates about 30 percent of the blood in our body. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2766.0s)]
*  But the other 70 percent of the circulation is is is an activity called vasomotor or vasomotion. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2768.0s)]
*  I think of a snake swallowing a mouse and we don't really cater to this part of our circulatory system. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2774.0s)]
*  Explain what you're saying. A snake swallowing a mouse. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2781.0s)]
*  So think of a snake. So so if the heart doesn't circulate roughly 70 percent of the blood in our body, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2784.0s)]
*  how is that circulation occurring? Because obviously blood is still moving. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2793.0s)]
*  You have about 63000 miles of blood vessel in your body. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2798.0s)]
*  And so there is your heart is not strong enough in a single contraction. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2803.0s)]
*  Your left ventricle, your heart that's ejecting that blood is not strong enough to push the blood through 63000 miles of vessel. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2808.0s)]
*  And so how does the majority of this circulation occur? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2816.0s)]
*  Well, the majority of our circulation is microvascular. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2820.0s)]
*  Right. So the microvascular circulation does not move blood by pressure. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2824.0s)]
*  It moves blood by something called vasomotion or vasomotor. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2830.0s)]
*  And the best way I can describe vasomotion or vasomotor is to think of a snake swallowing a mouse. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2834.0s)]
*  The reason why I say that is because there's no pressure coming in the front of the snake. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2840.0s)]
*  Right. It's not it's not being pushed down the snakes throat. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2844.0s)]
*  It's being muscularly moved down the snakes throughout. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2848.0s)]
*  So it's a wave like motion. Right. It's a it's this wave like motion called vasomotor or vasomotion and vascular laxity. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2852.0s)]
*  How the laxity that's in your vessels matters. Your blood viscosity matters and inflammation matters. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2863.0s)]
*  This is why when you look at the percentage of high blood pressure diagnoses, for example, if you were to just Google what percentage of hypertension, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2870.0s)]
*  primary hypertension, essential hypertension or, you know, high blood pressure is idiopathic. Right. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2878.0s)]
*  Of unknown origin, you'd see that 85 percent of all high blood pressure, hyperdensive diagnosis are idiopathic. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2886.0s)]
*  We don't know the origin. And so we examine these people's heart. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2892.0s)]
*  EKG, EEG, heart sounds, lung sounds, maybe a di-contrast study, maybe a CT angiogram, maybe, you know, some other kind of diagnostic heart imaging. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2896.0s)]
*  We can't find anything wrong with the heart. And we medicate the heart anyway. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2907.0s)]
*  Generally for a crime, it's not committing. When there's an 85 percent chance, it's actually something other than the heart. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2911.0s)]
*  And we never look to the microvascular circulation. We never look to the 70 percent of our circulation that's actually not done by our heart. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2916.0s)]
*  What are we doing to cater to that 70 percent of our circulation? Well, things like resveratrol, hydrogen gas, lowering our homocysteine, which is for most people is very simple to do. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2922.0s)]
*  I use an amino acid called trimethylglycine to help people metabolize homocysteine because those microvasculature is very susceptible to high levels of homocysteine. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2935.0s)]
*  And there's so many people that have ailments that are consequences of poor circulation. And we're treating something completely different. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2946.0s)]
*  So, for example, we're focused on concentration, lots of autoimmune conditions. If you look at the circulation in the brain, liver, lungs, pancreas, kidneys, you'll see that the majority of this circulation is microvascular. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2958.0s)]
*  You know, I've talked about why you and I both had a positive experience, for example, with red light. What is red light doing to our eyes? Is it fixing the rods, the macula, the cones, the retina? Was there something damaged that red light fixed? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2973.0s)]
*  No, it just restored healthy vasomotor activity to the back of your eye, which is why I never wear protection in a red light bed. Now, am I saying a red light bed is going to cure your eyesight? No. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2985.0s)]
*  It's a beat up for that. But red light therapy is extraordinarily good for vasomotor circulation. Why do you think it improves your skin, the collagen, the elastin, the fibrin? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=2995.0s)]
*  Why do you think it reduces fine lines and wrinkles? Why does it improve? Why can it improve our eyesight? Because it restores healthy vasomotor activity. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3006.0s)]
*  And there's so much microvasculature in our body that we don't really cater to this entire segment of our circulatory system. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3015.0s)]
*  Think about how small a capillary artery has to be to carry a fluid to the edge of the lung, exchange a gas with the inside of the lung, pull that gas into the fluid and not bleed into the lung. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3023.0s)]
*  So just think about how tiny that tube has to be and how many of those you have to have. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3038.0s)]
*  Because don't forget, right outside of your lungs, you got fluid. Those alveoli are grabbing gas and throwing that into a fluid. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3044.0s)]
*  Well, at some point, that pipe has to meet a piece of tissue. How is it not bleeding into that tissue? It is that small. It's microvasculature. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3050.0s)]
*  This is also where hydrogen gas comes into play. So I don't know where I was going with that point, but I just find it fascinating that we've got so many things that we can do to cater to a lot of these ailments that people chalk up to. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3060.0s)]
*  A consequence of aging. And they can be as simple as catering to that portion of your your circulatory system. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3073.0s)]
*  It would be so fascinating to run a study, a long term study on twins, identical twins, and have one person just eat the standard American diet and the other person follow all these protocols. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3081.0s)]
*  Hydrogen gas, fitness, healthy food, no seed oil, no drinking and just see. Yeah. What do they look like after 10 years? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3092.0s)]
*  After 10 years. Yeah, 20 years. 20 years would be wild. Wild. Be like sending one of them to space, you know. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3101.0s)]
*  And it's so funny because, you know, we're so wrapped around our medical system that's really 50, 60 years old, 70 years old, and how important a randomized clinical trial is and placebo controlled randomized clinical trial that's been peer reviewed and all of this. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3107.0s)]
*  But we negate the Eastern philosophies that very often have been around for thousands of years. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3125.0s)]
*  And I almost have more lend more validity to something that's actually stood the test of time like something that doesn't work. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3131.0s)]
*  He's not going to last a thousand years. You know, by virtue of the fact that it doesn't work when we were when we were in the mortality space, we never used randomized clinical trials. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3139.0s)]
*  We used big data. And I think what you're about to see now that I was alluding to before is we built an entire system on, you know, the the most rigorous scientific study being the randomized clinical placebo controlled randomized clinical trial. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3148.0s)]
*  So that is the gold standard. And if it hasn't been through this process, it is not valid. Well, we've never done randomized clinical trials on on parachutes. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3163.0s)]
*  But I wouldn't jump out of an airplane without one. Who wants to be in that? Who wants to be in the control group? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3172.0s)]
*  Okay, Stan, yeah, you light up here. You're getting the knapsack and a prayer book and we're getting a parachute. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3179.0s)]
*  Very good point. It's a very good point for there's some things you really can't run randomized controlled studies on. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3186.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, sometimes we just have data, right? We have really good data. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3192.0s)]
*  And and and one of the things I used to get just absolutely slaughtered for was I spoke out about the the simple LDL hypothesis of cholesterol, saying that there is no correlation between elevated levels of LDL cholesterol on its own and cardiovascular disease. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3197.0s)]
*  You had to have corresponding increases in triglyceride. You had to have inflammatory factors. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3214.0s)]
*  Usually had to have other metabolic factors like hyper triglycerideemia, hyperinsulinemia. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3218.0s)]
*  And and and yet everybody would really come after me for that. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3224.0s)]
*  And now we're starting to see that the data on statins is really falling apart. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3233.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, big data is starting to tell us that the the extension of life is is near zero. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3239.0s)]
*  But the extension of all cause mortality is near zero. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3247.0s)]
*  And then the complications downstream, which we never study, I mean, you'll never find a randomized clinical trial looking at more than one pharmaceutical compound in the same biome. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3251.0s)]
*  Yet almost everybody at the age of 60 is on five or more prescriptions. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3261.0s)]
*  But we don't study prescriptions in in concert with one another. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3266.0s)]
*  We study them independently. We say, OK, if you have high cholesterol, you're on a statin. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3271.0s)]
*  That's independent. If you have, you know, your hemoglobin A1C is over six point four, you're now insulin dependent. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3275.0s)]
*  OK, so now you're on insulin. You've been a little sad lately. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3281.0s)]
*  So now you're on an SSRI and your thyroid is a hypo function. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3284.0s)]
*  So now you're also on a synthroid or levothyroxine or arbythyroid. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3289.0s)]
*  And, you know, your blood's gotten a little thick because you're on hormone therapy. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3294.0s)]
*  So now you are on a blood thinner. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3298.0s)]
*  We've never studied the compounding effect of all of these different pharmaceuticals in the same biome. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3301.0s)]
*  We just assume that the randomized clinical trial and these independent silos is valid even though we're going to smack all of these things together. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3309.0s)]
*  And one of the things that we learned in the mortality space was the more pharmaceuticals you were on, the easier it was for us to predict your life expectancy. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3317.0s)]
*  It was extraordinarily accurate, for example, if somebody started a corticosteroid, which is very common for rheumatoid arthritis and, you know, other forms of joint pain and whatnot. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3328.0s)]
*  If you started a corticosteroid, you had, by our data, six years and one day until you were getting a joint replacement. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3338.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3347.0s)]
*  Six years and one day. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3348.0s)]
*  So that's the average? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3349.0s)]
*  That was the average. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3351.0s)]
*  So let's say, for example, that. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3353.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3355.0s)]
*  Because initially corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory, but then they eat the joint like a termite. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3356.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3362.0s)]
*  And, you know, we knew this in professional sports and a lot of careers were ended early from cortisone injections. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3363.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of athletes had their careers actually end early because they got too many cortisone injections. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3368.0s)]
*  How many is too many? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3373.0s)]
*  You know, it sort of depends on the joint and the location. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3375.0s)]
*  One of them can be beneficial? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3378.0s)]
*  One of them can be very beneficial. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3379.0s)]
*  In the acute phase of a pain or injury, they can be very beneficial. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3381.0s)]
*  But what they used to do is because these were repetitive use injuries and, you know, very often they would just dose the athlete up before a game. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3384.0s)]
*  So, I mean, Joe Theismann. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3392.0s)]
*  I mean, not Joe Theismann. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3393.0s)]
*  Joe Montana. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3395.0s)]
*  You know, he's one of those careers that entered early very likely because of cortisone injections. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3397.0s)]
*  And you keep injecting the same ligamentous tissue with cortisone. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3401.0s)]
*  Eventually you will weaken that tissue and it will snap. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3405.0s)]
*  You know, first it has an anti-inflammatory reaction, but then it starts to break down the cartilage like a termite. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3407.0s)]
*  In fact, it was so accurate that very often what would happen is people would get misdiagnosed with conditions like rheumatoid because they had the same symptomology as rheumatoid. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3415.0s)]
*  But what they actually had was a long term clinical deficiency in vitamin D3. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3431.0s)]
*  And you would see that they would have single digit vitamin D3 for decades. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3436.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they would start to present with symptoms that mimicked rheumatoid. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3442.0s)]
*  They would say, hey, doc, you know, my soles of my feet and ankles are sore when I got out of bed in the morning to go take my first pee. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3446.0s)]
*  I feel like I had a workout the night before when I haven't. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3452.0s)]
*  You know, my low back hurts. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3456.0s)]
*  My knees and hips and shoulders are stiff. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3457.0s)]
*  Now it's spread to my upper back. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3459.0s)]
*  And lately it's kind of hard to make a really tight fist. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3461.0s)]
*  If you give those symptoms to the wrong primary care doctor, maybe without doing any any confirming diagnosis, without said rates, without R.A. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3464.0s)]
*  Factors, they go, you know what, Joe, you've got rheumatoid arthritis. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3473.0s)]
*  But don't worry, I'm going to put you on something called a corticosteroid. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3475.0s)]
*  You're going to take this pill every morning. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3478.0s)]
*  You're going to be fine. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3480.0s)]
*  Methotrexate, whatever it is. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3481.0s)]
*  And initially you feel great because it kills the inflammation. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3483.0s)]
*  But then it starts to erode the cartilaginous surface. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3488.0s)]
*  So if you think about the fact that you had a nutrient deficiency, that you're now being treated with a pharmaceutical and six years and one day later. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3492.0s)]
*  Now, by the way, the methotrexate, for example, will give you a gene mutation. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3501.0s)]
*  It will mimic a gene mutation called M.T.H.F.R. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3506.0s)]
*  Oh, that one. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3509.0s)]
*  That one. The motherfucker gene. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3510.0s)]
*  Motherfucker gene. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3512.0s)]
*  Yeah, the motherfucker gene. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3513.0s)]
*  So even if you don't have M.T.H.F.R. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3514.0s)]
*  Let's try one of those. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3518.0s)]
*  Yeah, I might as well try it. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3519.0s)]
*  Even if you don't have M.T.H.F.R., if you take methotrexate, you inhibit your folate metabolism. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3521.0s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3528.0s)]
*  Cheers, bro. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3529.0s)]
*  Hydrogen gas, now coffee. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3531.0s)]
*  I actually saw you sniffing something on one of your podcasts. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3535.0s)]
*  Smell and salt? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3537.0s)]
*  What was that? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3538.0s)]
*  I don't want to do it, by the way. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3539.0s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3540.0s)]
*  Jamie, chuck one over there. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3541.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3542.0s)]
*  I brought it up the wrong time. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3543.0s)]
*  Give me a freshening. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3544.0s)]
*  I'm not doing it. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3545.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3546.0s)]
*  I just see all this shit over here. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3547.0s)]
*  This is a fresh one. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3549.0s)]
*  This one hasn't been opened yet. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3550.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3551.0s)]
*  This is, do you know who Juju Mufu is? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3552.0s)]
*  Juju Mufu? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3554.0s)]
*  Yeah, super, well, he's an influencer, but he's like a very impressive athlete. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3555.0s)]
*  Like super jacked, unbelievably fit guy. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3560.0s)]
*  Dude, if you've got a name like Juju Mufu, you've got to be able to beat ass. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3564.0s)]
*  Incredibly flexible. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3566.0s)]
*  This is the guy. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3568.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I've seen him. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3569.0s)]
*  He's a freak. Like a real freak. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3570.0s)]
*  I mean, for sure he's not natural. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3571.0s)]
*  There's not a fucking chance in hell, but I don't care. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3573.0s)]
*  But what he makes this stuff, we have no affiliation with him. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3575.0s)]
*  We buy it. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3579.0s)]
*  It's not, we're not sponsored. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3580.0s)]
*  So people, oh, you're making money off that, bro. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3581.0s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm not making money. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3584.0s)]
*  Dude, I'm scared, dude. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3586.0s)]
*  I saw Theo Vaughn almost, almost like. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3587.0s)]
*  Brian Simpson took his headphones off and ran out of the room. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3589.0s)]
*  No, dude, I'm not getting anywhere near that. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3592.0s)]
*  No, this is a good one. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3595.0s)]
*  I'm going to sniff it with the top on. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3597.0s)]
*  Just the bag. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3599.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3600.0s)]
*  Just the bag. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3601.0s)]
*  And it's sealed. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3602.0s)]
*  Give me the bag. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3603.0s)]
*  Ugh. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3604.0s)]
*  This is so wrong. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3605.0s)]
*  It is wrong. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3607.0s)]
*  I feel so dirty. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3608.0s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3609.0s)]
*  That's nothing. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3610.0s)]
*  That's nothing. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3611.0s)]
*  That's just the bag that the smelling salts have been sitting in. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3612.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3615.0s)]
*  So what power lifters do is they take a sniff of this shit right before they lift weights. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3616.0s)]
*  You ready? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3621.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3622.0s)]
*  No. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3623.0s)]

*  Oh, lordy. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3627.0s)]
*  Dude, there is zero chance I'm going to win. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3630.0s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3635.0s)]

*  Come on. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3638.0s)]
*  Reach for it. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3639.0s)]
*  Peer pressure. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3640.0s)]
*  Take it. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3641.0s)]
*  Get it about six inches from the nose. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3642.0s)]
*  Take a haul. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3643.0s)]
*  It's good for you. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3644.0s)]
*  I can't guarantee it's good for you. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3645.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3646.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3647.0s)]
*  That was nothing. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3648.0s)]
*  That got me, dude. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3649.0s)]
*  That came in from the bottom. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3650.0s)]
*  Come on. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3651.0s)]
*  You're a biohacker. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3652.0s)]

*  Get in there. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3654.0s)]
*  Take a sniff. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3655.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was real man. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3656.0s)]
*  I don't do this shit. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3657.0s)]
*  Get in there, bro. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3658.0s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3659.0s)]

*  That's what I'm talking about. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3661.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3664.0s)]
*  And that was a freshie. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3665.0s)]
*  The fresh ones are the really hard ones. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3668.0s)]
*  We have these in the green room at the comedy club. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3670.0s)]
*  People get addicted. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3672.0s)]
*  They're all taking snitches before they go on stage. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3673.0s)]
*  I think I lost sight of my left eye. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3674.0s)]
*  Yeah, it'll come back better. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3676.0s)]
*  Come back stronger. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3677.0s)]
*  I have no data to support that, by the way. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3678.0s)]
*  Now I'm going to go down the rabbit hole of that. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3681.0s)]
*  You're going to want another one in about five minutes. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3684.0s)]
*  Give me round two. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3686.0s)]
*  Where were we, dude? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3691.0s)]
*  We were actually something important. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3692.0s)]
*  We have to track same MTHFR, I think. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3693.0s)]
*  I did want to ask you about cholesterol before I forget. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3696.0s)]
*  Where did the narrative come from that there's good cholesterol and bad cholesterol, and [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3699.0s)]
*  that HDL is good, LDL is bad, you want to lower your LDL, and you want to take a statin? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3705.0s)]
*  Where did all this? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3711.0s)]
*  So, you know, high density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein, the HDL, the high [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3713.0s)]
*  density lipoprotein is generally considered the good cholesterol, and the LDL, the low [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3720.0s)]
*  density, or VLDL, very low density lipoprotein are considered the bad cholesterol because [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3725.0s)]
*  they're softer. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3729.0s)]
*  But what we know now is that the size of the cholesterol molecule matters a lot. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3731.0s)]
*  In other words, the smaller the particulate size of cholesterol, the easier it is to cross [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3737.0s)]
*  into the arterial wall. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3743.0s)]
*  You can see it eaten by macrophage and it forms something called a foam cell, which [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3745.0s)]
*  is essentially this foam cell process of oxidized cholesterol is what is the genesis of narrowing [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3750.0s)]
*  of the arteries. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3756.0s)]
*  But again, we have to remember that cholesterol is called to the site of inflammation. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3758.0s)]
*  So if you had two people, one with cholesterol of 100 and LDL cholesterol and another one [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3764.0s)]
*  with cholesterol of 129, does a person with 129 have a higher incidence of cardiovascular [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3770.0s)]
*  disease? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3777.0s)]
*  No. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3778.0s)]
*  Does the person of 129 have a greater risk of a cardiovascular event? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3779.0s)]
*  No, just because they have elevated LDL cholesterol. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3784.0s)]
*  Now, if you start to look at other markers like C-reactive protein, which is a great [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3786.0s)]
*  marker for cardiovascular risk, if you look at triglyceride cholesterol ratio, because [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3790.0s)]
*  remember, fat, triglyceride, is largely transported around the body on the surface of cholesterol. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3796.0s)]
*  So if cholesterol was a tennis ball, the fuzzy yellow surface would be a fat, triglyceride. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3802.0s)]
*  And if you remember from high school geometry, as the size of a sphere gets smaller, its [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3809.0s)]
*  surface area to volume ratio goes up. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3814.0s)]
*  So what that means is if I had two baskets, dude, I can still, that thing is, I gotta [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3817.0s)]
*  seal this thing, dude. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3822.0s)]
*  It's like, I'm gonna go blind in my left eye. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3824.0s)]
*  I'm trying to be smart and I can't see out of my left eye. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3827.0s)]
*  What is it? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3833.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3834.0s)]
*  Ammonia? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3835.0s)]
*  Ah, it's no joke, man. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3836.0s)]
*  I remember my clinic when Dr. Sarda used to tape these things to the wall because she [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3839.0s)]
*  would do these shoulder injections on people and they would get woozy and she would just [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3844.0s)]
*  crack one of those smelling salts and they'd come right back. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3848.0s)]
*  Yeah, they used to use them for boxers when they got knocked out. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3850.0s)]
*  When they got rocked and they'd get into the corner, they'd give them smelling salts and [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3853.0s)]
*  they'd wake right up. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3856.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3857.0s)]
*  Not really, but. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3858.0s)]
*  So let's say you had two basketballs of cholesterol. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3859.0s)]
*  This is an oversimplified version for the audience, but you have two basketballs of [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3860.0s)]
*  cholesterol and they're covered in fat, okay, or triglyceride. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3864.0s)]
*  And let's say I add more triglyceride to the bloodstream, right, which happens when you [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3868.0s)]
*  eat high sugar, high glycemic carbohydrate. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3873.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3876.0s)]
*  Because part of insulin's role is to block forms of energy metabolism that would allow [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3877.0s)]
*  you to burn fat or at least slow those pathways down. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3882.0s)]
*  So essentially you have two basketballs of cholesterol and now I want to add more fat [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3887.0s)]
*  to the table. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3891.0s)]
*  Those two basketballs become four softballs. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3893.0s)]
*  If I add more triglyceride to the table, they become eight baseballs. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3896.0s)]
*  If I add more triglyceride, they become 16 golf balls. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3899.0s)]
*  And if I continue to raise triglyceride, they'll become 32 little BBs. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3903.0s)]
*  So the point is, the amount of cholesterol stayed stable. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3908.0s)]
*  The amount of triglyceride went up. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3912.0s)]
*  As the amount of triglyceride went up, the size of the cholesterol molecule got smaller. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3916.0s)]
*  So the two basketballs and the 32 BBs are the same volume of cholesterol, same nanogram [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3923.0s)]
*  per deciliter of cholesterol, just vastly different sizes. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3929.0s)]
*  Those 32 BBs, very dangerous. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3934.0s)]
*  Those two basketballs, very little danger. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3937.0s)]
*  One is actually a marker for longevity. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3940.0s)]
*  One is a marker for cardiovascular disease. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3943.0s)]
*  And it is the same amount of cholesterol, just different sizes. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3945.0s)]
*  So different sizes. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3951.0s)]
*  I got my blood drawn a couple years ago, and the doctor asked me if I was on cholesterol medication. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3953.0s)]
*  He said, your cholesterol is really low. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3959.0s)]
*  He goes, are you on medication? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3961.0s)]
*  I said, no. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3963.0s)]
*  But I eat mostly meat. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3964.0s)]
*  Yeah, your triglycerides would usually go down. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3966.0s)]
*  Your LDL cholesterol will go up if you're on a ketogenic diet. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3970.0s)]
*  Dr. I think it's Nadir Singh is his name. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3974.0s)]
*  Did an unbelievable, he's a cardiologist, did an unbelievable YouTube video on this. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3979.0s)]
*  I actually did a podcast with Dr. Aseem Malhotra, who is a cardiologist. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3984.0s)]
*  He's been here. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3988.0s)]
*  Has he been here too? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3989.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3990.0s)]
*  Unbelievable guy. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3991.0s)]
*  Love that guy. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3992.0s)]
*  Shout out to Aseem. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3993.0s)]
*  He's an incredible, incredible guy. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3994.0s)]
*  And Aseem would tell you the same thing, that he fought the British Medical Journal and [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=3995.0s)]
*  got publications that he was trying to have published, you know, pulled because he was [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4002.0s)]
*  fighting the narrative on statins, one of the biggest, biggest drugs in the world. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4006.0s)]
*  We knew in the mortality space that the centenarians that we were processing death claims on, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4011.0s)]
*  I don't recall a time during my career when we had a death claim on a centenarian, somebody [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4018.0s)]
*  over the age of 100, that did not have elevated levels of LDL cholesterol at the time of their [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4025.0s)]
*  death, because very often these people would die either in hospitals or CISIC care living [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4030.0s)]
*  facilities, and we'd process the death claim. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4033.0s)]
*  And in order to get the death claim processed, you'd have to know, you know, day, day, time, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4035.0s)]
*  location, cause of death. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4039.0s)]
*  They'd have to, and we'd have to get a death certificate. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4040.0s)]
*  And these people were dying with elevated levels of LDL cholesterol, which you would [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4043.0s)]
*  think, well, wouldn't they have died a lot younger of cardiovascular disease? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4048.0s)]
*  And now the data is starting to come out to support these other metabolic issues like [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4052.0s)]
*  hyperinsulinemia, you know, hypertriglyceridemia, high blood sugar, that these are villains [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4057.0s)]
*  that precede cholesterol, you know, attaching to the arterial wall. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4068.0s)]
*  And so when we talk about metabolic health, we really shouldn't just isolate LDL cholesterol. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4073.0s)]
*  We should be looking at our blood pressure, you know, our abdominal obesity, our blood [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4079.0s)]
*  sugar, our sugars mainly, whether or not, you know, what our fasting blood glucose is, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4087.0s)]
*  what the three month average of our blood sugar is, our hemoglobin A1C, making sure [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4092.0s)]
*  that's below preferably 5.4. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4096.0s)]
*  Looking at our insulin, because insulin resistance develops a long time before a lot of these [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4099.0s)]
*  things show up, and looking at other inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and just [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4103.0s)]
*  generalized markers of inflammation, because most people are eating a very pro-inflammatory [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4107.0s)]
*  diet. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4111.0s)]
*  And this is why you can't isolate one thing and say seed oils are what's killing Americans. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4112.0s)]
*  What's killing vaccines or what's killing Americans? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4116.0s)]
*  Aluminum vaccines or fluoride in drinking water. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4118.0s)]
*  It's the cumulative dose toxicity of all of these things. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4121.0s)]
*  You know, our water is toxic, and we have fluoride, we have chlorines, we have PFAs, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4125.0s)]
*  polyfluoroalkyls, we have microplastics, we have bisphenols. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4131.0s)]
*  You know, I actually did a test on myself and my entire family called a vibrant wellness test. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4135.0s)]
*  And it's a blood and urine test, and essentially it tells you whether you got mold, micro toxins, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4141.0s)]
*  heavy metals, all of these different things. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4148.0s)]
*  The amount of BPAs in my blood, and I would consider myself pretty on top of my diet game. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4151.0s)]
*  The amount of BPAs, there are traces of jet fuel, there are aflatoxins. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4159.0s)]
*  Jet fuel. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4165.0s)]
*  There are traces of jet fuel. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4166.0s)]
*  From all your flying? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4167.0s)]
*  Like accelerants, like aerosol accelerants, maybe from flying, I fly a lot. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4168.0s)]
*  My daughter had it in her blood too, and so did my wife. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4174.0s)]
*  And then we all had very similar species of mold, which we got rid of, and I felt a lot better. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4179.0s)]
*  And it was in your home? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4186.0s)]
*  It was actually in my daughter's apartment. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4188.0s)]
*  We actually ended up having our doctor write a letter and break her lease, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4190.0s)]
*  and we moved her into an apartment right next to us in Coconut Grove in Florida. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4194.0s)]
*  But she was starting to have, and she's a nurse, and she was starting to have these strange symptoms, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4200.0s)]
*  just brain fog, her joints were just killing her in the morning. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4206.0s)]
*  By the end of the day, her ankles were swollen. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4211.0s)]
*  Her mood started to collapse, like the peaks and valleys of her mood kind of went away. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4214.0s)]
*  And she was, you know, I was bringing her over to the house, and obviously as a biohacker, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4219.0s)]
*  I'm trying to solve everything. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4224.0s)]
*  So I was like, we got to do this fiber well in this test medicine. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4226.0s)]
*  We got to figure out what's going on. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4228.0s)]
*  And then boom, the mold just jumped off the chart. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4229.0s)]
*  Our youngest daughter too was suffering from recurrent sore throats. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4232.0s)]
*  And you know that viruses and, I mean, bacteria and mold have been mortal enemies for years. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4236.0s)]
*  I mean, think penicillin and bacteria, right? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4244.0s)]
*  And so we live in the mold capital of the world, and very often when you get mold toxicity, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4246.0s)]
*  it doesn't just, it's not just a constant infection. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4251.0s)]
*  It has a latent phase, a dormant phase, and then a sporulating phase. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4254.0s)]
*  And so these mold infections, which a lot of doctors will tell you are complete nonsense, are absolutely valid. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4260.0s)]
*  I mean, there are people right now that have severe brain fog, they have joint pain, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4267.0s)]
*  they have really poor focus and concentration and short-term memory issues. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4273.0s)]
*  They've got hormone imbalance. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4277.0s)]
*  They've got water retention, and they got swollen ankles, and they cannot really figure it out. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4278.0s)]
*  And they'll do a standard blood test, and you don't see this on a standard blood test. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4286.0s)]
*  And when you do something like a Vibrant and you look at these, this mold toxicity, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4290.0s)]
*  you get rid of it and you see the entire blood panel comes back into optimal ranges, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4296.0s)]
*  and they feel amazing, just like my daughter. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4303.0s)]
*  We did EBO2, we did sauna, we did gut binders, activated charcoal binders, hydrolysis glutathione. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4305.0s)]
*  And over the next few weeks, we slowly walked this mold right out of her system. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4313.0s)]
*  But people suffer from this all the time. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4319.0s)]
*  In fact, I've been deep down the rabbit hole of a lot of the foundations of these autoimmune diseases [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4321.0s)]
*  because in my previous clinic, we had 150,000, 160,000 patients come through our clinic system. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4328.0s)]
*  And nearly everyone that we saw that had an autoimmune disease was told by their doctor, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4338.0s)]
*  you just woke up one day and your immune system went haywire. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4348.0s)]
*  So you have Crohn's disease because one day you woke up and your immune system is manufacturing antibodies to your colon, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4351.0s)]
*  or you have hypothyroid because you woke up one morning and your immune system is manufacturing antibodies to your thyroid. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4357.0s)]
*  So now you have Hashimoto's or the lacrimal gland in your eye and you have chagrins or your blood, you have lupus. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4365.0s)]
*  And we immediately just assumed that God made a mistake, that the immune system is malfunctioning. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4370.0s)]
*  Instead of taking a step back and saying, you know, what if actually the immune system is acting properly? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4376.0s)]
*  What if God didn't make a mistake? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4384.0s)]
*  What if it's attacking the colon for a reason? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4387.0s)]
*  We just have to figure it out. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4390.0s)]
*  And if you just eliminated four things, mold, mycotoxin, heavy metals, viruses and parasites, just those four categories, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4392.0s)]
*  I believe you would get to the majority of the genesis of autoimmune diseases. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4400.0s)]
*  You know, some of these autopsy studies on multiple sclerosis, for example, were 100% positive for certain colonies of helminths. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4405.0s)]
*  Helminths? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4414.0s)]
*  Helminths, which are parasites. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4416.0s)]
*  And these helminth colonies or the larvae from these were actually in the myelin sheath of 10 of 10 autopsies that they did on multiple sclerosis patients. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4418.0s)]
*  I'm not by any means saying that everybody that has multiple sclerosis has parasitic infection. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4432.0s)]
*  But there are healthy parasites. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4438.0s)]
*  There's categories of helminths that are very, very healthy. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4441.0s)]
*  And some of the underdeveloped countries in the world where actually they have these healthy parasites, which we've wiped out for the large part here, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4444.0s)]
*  they don't get multiple sclerosis or they have very, very low incidence of multiple sclerosis. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4453.0s)]
*  And one of the theories is that because we have we have disrupted the balance of not only bacteria, but parasites in our gut, specifically TSO parasites, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4457.0s)]
*  which are which are healthy parasites, that the the pathogenic parasites proliferate and they burrow their their larvae burrow into the myelin sheath. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4468.0s)]
*  And they're part of the genesis of multiple sclerosis. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4479.0s)]
*  My whole point in saying that is if you take any pair of pathogen, let's just take this one right here. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4482.0s)]
*  This is looks like a Donald Trump coin. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4487.0s)]
*  So I don't know if the audience could see this, but let's say this was a mold spore or mycotoxin or this was a heavy metal or even a virus. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4489.0s)]
*  And this was a healthy cell. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4498.0s)]
*  You see that they don't hide like this. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4501.0s)]
*  Right. Metals, mycotoxins, mold, you know, viruses, even in some cases, parasites, they don't hide outside of the cell like this. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4503.0s)]
*  They hide like this and inside the inside the cell. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4510.0s)]
*  I mean, but when a virus when the nucleocapsid protein of a virus attaches to a cell and injects its DNA, that's the way that it takes over that cell. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4515.0s)]
*  It's kind of like being bitten by the zombie. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4524.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, a virus is not a living thing. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4526.0s)]
*  It's an envelope that that's wrapped around DNA. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4528.0s)]
*  But when that envelope attaches to the cell wall and it squirts the DNA inside, now the virus is taken over the host cell. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4530.0s)]
*  Right. So it's inside the cell. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4538.0s)]
*  The point is that the immune system is not after this. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4540.0s)]
*  It's not after the cell. It's after this. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4544.0s)]
*  So so how does it how does it get to this? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4547.0s)]
*  It has to kick down this wall. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4549.0s)]
*  It has to break through this cell wall. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4551.0s)]
*  And very often in order to do that, it needs to manufacture an antibody to this cell. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4553.0s)]
*  If you look, for example, at hype, you know, for Hashimoto's, which a lot of people have, you know, these people have Hashimoto's and they're told, OK, well, you woke up one day and your immune system decided to attack the the the thyroid, you know, your manufacturing antibodies to your thyroid. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4561.0s)]
*  And so well, why is it attacking my thyroid? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4580.0s)]
*  Well, we don't know. Let's look at your family history. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4582.0s)]
*  Oh, your your mom's sister had it and your dad's brother had it. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4585.0s)]
*  Oh, you have familial Hashimoto's, even though there is no gene for Hashimoto's. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4590.0s)]
*  So you couldn't have inherited it from your ancestor because it now runs in your family. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4596.0s)]
*  You're told that you have a genetically inherited disease and now you have to subscribe to a lifetime of medication instead of taking a step back and saying, well, what would have called my immune system to that site? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4601.0s)]
*  Look at the incidence of heavy metal toxicity, mercury poisoning in Hashimoto's. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4612.0s)]
*  Look at the amount of lead and mercury poisoning in Hashimoto's because the thyroid has an affinity for heavy metals. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4617.0s)]
*  And very often when they retreat into the thyroid, the immune system will chase them there. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4624.0s)]
*  And look at the genesis of a lot of Crohn's disease. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4628.0s)]
*  I mean, a lot of Crohn's disease has to do with the disruption of the single cell layer in your gut that allows bacteria and other pathogenic contents that should stay inside the luminal wall of your gut. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4631.0s)]
*  They leak out and they they're in an area that they don't belong and the immune system is attacking them there. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4642.0s)]
*  And then we want to hold the immune system responsible for the crime and say, hey, we're going to we're going to arrest the police officer for what this criminal did. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4647.0s)]
*  I mean, those contents are in areas of the body where they don't belong. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4658.0s)]
*  And so we're going to put you on an immunosuppressant or we're going to put you on an anti-inflammatory and we're actually going to stop the immune system from protecting you. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4662.0s)]
*  Instead of saying what contents could be leaking from my gut that are causing the immune system to light up. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4670.0s)]
*  And you could just keep going through lots of autoimmune diseases like this, you know, multiple sclerosis, a lot of these conditions, but mold, mycotoxins, metals, parasites. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4676.0s)]
*  I mean, if I was ever told that I had an autoimmune disease, I would not accept it until I'd done those kinds of tests. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4685.0s)]
*  Interesting. So back to the narrative of HDL and LDL. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4693.0s)]
*  How did it get formed that LDL is the bad cholesterol? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4698.0s)]
*  Because the majority of people that had high LDL cholesterol also had high other factors going on in their body. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4702.0s)]
*  And just like a lot of these randomized clinical trials, we look at things in isolation. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4711.0s)]
*  We study one thing in isolation. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4715.0s)]
*  One of the worst things we do, in my opinion, in modern science is study human anatomy or human physiology or biochemistry in isolation. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4717.0s)]
*  So we say we're going to take a cell out of the body. We're going to put it in a lab. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4725.0s)]
*  We're going to look how it behaves in a petri dish. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4728.0s)]
*  And then we're going to assume that when I put that cell back into the body, it's going to behave the same way. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4730.0s)]
*  And so we didn't solve for all of these other factors. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4735.0s)]
*  Well, what was the person's insulin level? What was their fasting glucose? What was their hemoglobin A1C? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4738.0s)]
*  What were their other inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, creatine phosphokinase? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4745.0s)]
*  What were the other lifestyle factors that were going on? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4749.0s)]
*  And what you'll find is it correlation between high levels of cholesterol and people that have cardiovascular disease, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4753.0s)]
*  but not because of the cholesterol, because of all of the diet and lifestyle risk factors that go around it. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4763.0s)]
*  But we can build a multibillion dollar, in fact, a trillion dollar industry by just lowering this one biomarker. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4769.0s)]
*  And when we lower this biomarker, if that biomarker were directly linked to all-cause mortality, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4776.0s)]
*  if it were directly linked to the incidence of cardiovascular disease, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4783.0s)]
*  then we would see in the population where we lowered this biomarker, we would see an extension of mortality, right? [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4787.0s)]
*  Because we said this biomarker was high, LDL. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4793.0s)]
*  So if we lower it with a statin, then we're going to see an extension of mortality. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4796.0s)]
*  And lo and behold, we see no extension of mortality. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4799.0s)]
*  So how does it continue to be used? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4802.0s)]
*  Because it's continued to be marketed that way. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4804.0s)]
*  You have to understand that there's a box that is called the standard of care. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4806.0s)]
*  And I don't subscribe to the fact that physicians are trying to harm you. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4810.0s)]
*  In fact, I have the deepest respect for people that are licensed to practice medicine, because I'm not one of them. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4813.0s)]
*  And they go through a schooling to learn to practice within something called the standard of care. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4819.0s)]
*  If you're outside of the standard of care, your malpractice is at risk, your reimbursement is at risk, your career is at risk. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4828.0s)]
*  So you may very well be doing something that is in your scope of practice, but it is outside the standard of care. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4836.0s)]
*  So most physicians will migrate back into the standard of care. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4844.0s)]
*  So even if you go around to a bunch of allopathic doctors and get multiple opinions, they'll all be within this box. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4848.0s)]
*  When you jump outside of that box, you've got to be talking to somebody who's willing to say, OK, you probably have to pay me cash. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4854.0s)]
*  You probably have put my malpractice at risk. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4861.0s)]
*  I don't have malpractice coverage for this type of treatment, not because they're breaking the law, but because they're not within the standard of care. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4864.0s)]
*  It's just like when physicians started to prescribe ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine for COVID when it wasn't the standard of care, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4871.0s)]
*  even though there were millions and millions and millions of scripts written for these pharmaceuticals that were proven to be extraordinarily safe. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4878.0s)]
*  I mean, our doctor used to have to write it for joint pain during COVID so she wouldn't potentially risk her license. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4888.0s)]
*  So what happens is you develop a herd mentality because the system for reimbursement, how they get paid, the system for coverage, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4895.0s)]
*  how they get malpractice coverage, and the system for their career is all dependent on things being inside of a certain box. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4904.0s)]
*  And the standard of care for someone with elevated LDL cholesterol is to put them on a statin. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4911.0s)]
*  If you don't do that, you could be risking your license. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4917.0s)]
*  And why is that the standard of care? Because pharma dictates that that's the standard of care. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4921.0s)]
*  They also dictate the reimbursement rates. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4927.0s)]
*  And so if you look at the study that was done in 2016 by Harvard, which determined that medical error was the third leading cause of death. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4929.0s)]
*  I think it was repeated by Hopkins in 2019. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4939.0s)]
*  But the Harvard study in 2016 is very clear that the third leading cause of death in America is medical error. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4941.0s)]
*  And when you look into the study for why, you know, were doctors just killing people? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4951.0s)]
*  I don't know. What happened was they looked at ICD-9, ICD-10, ICD-11 codes, how they're coding, you know, the diagnosis of what's happened to you. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4956.0s)]
*  I have to, as a doctor, I've got to sort of slot you into a diagnostic code so I can get reimbursed and you can get medication and we can all get paid. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4967.0s)]
*  And but if I don't have a diagnosis to slot you into, I got to pick sort of the next nearest one. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4978.0s)]
*  And there is no diagnosis or way for me to be reimbursed or to make a living if I go, look, Joe, your hemoglobin A1C is like 5.7. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4984.0s)]
*  You're early stage pre-diabetic. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4995.0s)]
*  You know, you've got a little abdominal obesity going on. Your blood pressure is creeping towards the high side. Your fasting glucose is really high. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=4999.0s)]
*  Let's talk about some diet and lifestyle choices. Tell me what's going on in your life. What's a typical day of your diet look like? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5007.0s)]
*  You know, can I put you on a treadmill for 25 or 30 minutes? Can I talk to you about intermittent fasting? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5012.0s)]
*  You know, can I talk to you about things like a whole food diet? No, none of that. All of that is outside the standard of care. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5017.0s)]
*  If something happens to you and I have a practice within the standard of care, I'm at risk. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5024.0s)]
*  And so I think a lot of that is what's really exciting about MAHAS. I think a lot of that is going to begin to change. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5029.0s)]
*  You're going to see Bobby Kennedy and his team. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5035.0s)]
*  Again, in my opinion, you're going to see Bobby Kennedy and his team, which have been empowered to make real change, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5040.0s)]
*  not just getting, you know, poison out of our food supply and having the generally regarded as safe guidelines, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5046.0s)]
*  look at food safety before we put it into the public domain. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5054.0s)]
*  But you're really going to see him go after corruption in our nutritional research, corruption in our in our governmental oversight bodies. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5060.0s)]
*  How is it that we can have people that sit in the Food and Drug Administration and regulate private industry [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5069.0s)]
*  and at the end of that regulatory career go in to work for the same industry that they purported to regulate? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5078.0s)]
*  And sometimes for 10 times what they would make as a as a regulator. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5085.0s)]
*  Kind of kooky. It seems to me like you would get arrested for that in another industry. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5090.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. I mean, if you did that in the securities industry, the banking industry, you wouldn't get away with it. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5094.0s)]
*  And, you know, 70 north of 70 percent, I think the number 74 percent of our nutritional research is funded by private industry. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5100.0s)]
*  You know, we we privatize the profit, but we socialize the expense. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5108.0s)]
*  And by this, I mean like we we socialize through the tax subsidized medical system, Medicaid, Medicare, the expenses. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5116.0s)]
*  Right. So the expenses go on to the taxpayer, but the payments go to private industry. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5125.0s)]
*  So we privatize the profit and we socialize the risk. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5130.0s)]
*  And then the private industry that benefits from this doesn't even have a fiduciary to the patients that they serve. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5133.0s)]
*  They actually have a fiduciary to the investor and they can go to prison for not actually performing for their investor. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5139.0s)]
*  They can't go to prison prison for not performing for their for their patients. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5145.0s)]
*  So I make a pharmaceutical that goes into your body. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5150.0s)]
*  But somebody lent invested in my company to make that pharmaceutical. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5154.0s)]
*  My responsibility is to them, not to you. So now you get harmed. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5158.0s)]
*  You get harmed. I'm I'm held harmless. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5162.0s)]
*  But if I harm him by not selling it to you for the right margin, he gets to put me in prison. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5165.0s)]
*  It's it's it's it's mine. It's so as backwards. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5171.0s)]
*  It's so as backwards and it's such an uphill sludge. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5176.0s)]
*  I mean, what what the current administration has to do with what Bobby Kennedy has to do is sort of re restructure decades and decades of what's essentially corruption. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5180.0s)]
*  Yeah. And there's a there's a lot of people fighting them on it, man. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5193.0s)]
*  Oh, I could only imagine because the amount of profit, you know, when you're talking about these industries, the the amount of money they generate is astronomical. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5198.0s)]
*  And they're responsible for so much of the advertising revenue of mainstream media that mainstream media not only will not cover the negative aspects of their drugs, but will heavily criticize anyone who tries to go outside the narrative. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5207.0s)]
*  Very true. And I mean, you know, look at this, you know, this Strong Kids Commission. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5225.0s)]
*  You know, it's the idea is to try to go to schools, put physical education back into schools, get highly processed foods out of the schools and actually not do fat shame kids, but to pro body morphic encourage them. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5231.0s)]
*  Like, yes, it's okay to not want to be sloppy and out of shape and to call that out and to actually be be physically fit and healthy. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5248.0s)]
*  It's not that you have to be there to be to gain status, but it's okay to not want to be fat. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5258.0s)]
*  Well, there's also there's the react. Look, I don't think you should shame people. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5263.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5267.0s)]
*  I don't think so either. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5268.0s)]
*  However, if someone pulls you aside and says, Hey, Bobby, you're overweight and it's fucking up your health. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5269.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's it's really bad for you. If that makes you feel bad and that feeling bad inspires a change in your lifestyle, in your diet, in exercise routines and what you do. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5277.0s)]
*  That's positive. And sometimes you have to feel bad like someone has to give you an F for you to realize, oh, my God, I'm going to fail on this class unless I study harder. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5292.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5302.0s)]
*  Like that's part of life. And you can't just coddle people and expect success. That's not how it works. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5303.0s)]
*  I totally agree. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5310.0s)]
*  It's one of the most important aspects of athletics, because athletics are a very clear. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5311.0s)]
*  It's a very clear formula that the more work you put in, the harder you train, the more results you'll get as long as you're not over training and you know you do correctly. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5317.0s)]
*  If you put in the effort, yeah, you work hard, you will get results. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5328.0s)]
*  And that's that's it's a vehicle for the rest of your life. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5333.0s)]
*  If you can learn that at a young age, that's why I think athletics are so important for young people. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5339.0s)]
*  If you can learn that at an early age that the discomfort is necessary for growth, like being tired, pushing yourself, working out when you don't want to like pushing yourself to the point where your body has to adapt and grow and become stronger is a part of this process. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5343.0s)]
*  And it's beneficial. And through doing that, you will actually feel better. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5361.0s)]
*  It is actually a medicine. If you could get the way you get the way I feel after I have a heart, if I cold plunge, have a hard workout, get in the sauna, stretch out and then go about my day. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5367.0s)]
*  If you could put that in a pill, people like, oh my God, my new anti anxiety medications is so incredible. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5379.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I take it every day. It's so incredible. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5384.0s)]
*  I'm so happy that I went to this doctor because he put me on the right stuff. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5386.0s)]
*  Yeah, that pill, especially if it did all the things that exercise did without exercise, it would be the most valuable pill in the world. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5390.0s)]
*  But getting people to feel discomfort voluntarily is so difficult when people have this sedentary lifestyle and this lazy mind and this entitlement that so many people have where they feel like the world owes them something. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5398.0s)]
*  Instead of I owe myself, I've got to work for myself. I've got to put off these feelings. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5413.0s)]
*  I've got to delay these feelings of relaxation and comfort and delay it and give myself some voluntary discomfort so that I can feel true peace. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5421.0s)]
*  Yeah, I actually trademarked the statement aging is the aggressive pursuit of comfort. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5434.0s)]
*  By the way, if you want to use that, just use it. I won't sue you. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5440.0s)]
*  Well, also, actually aging is part of it too. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5444.0s)]
*  Aging is the aggressive pursuit of comfort. And if you think about that for a minute, it truly is. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5448.0s)]
*  The more aggressively we seek comfort, the faster we age. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5453.0s)]
*  It's like we really got to stop telling grandma not to go outside. It's too hot. Not to go outside. It's too cold. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5456.0s)]
*  It's not even really aging, right? It's deterioration. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5461.0s)]
*  It's deterioration. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5464.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to add your muscles will atrophy, your bone density will decrease, your ligaments and your tendons will lose. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5466.0s)]
*  Because we seek comfort. I mean, when has a cold plunge not sucked? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5473.0s)]
*  Every day. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5477.0s)]
*  And for me, it sucks every time. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5478.0s)]
*  I don't want to do it. Every day while I'm doing it, there's my little inner bitch that's trying to talk me out of it. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5480.0s)]
*  My little inner bitch has a little whispery voice though. It's like, you know, you don't really want to do this. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5486.0s)]
*  You don't need to, Joe. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5491.0s)]
*  This is going to suck. Maybe you could just go eat cake. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5492.0s)]
*  You're rich and successful. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5494.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to do this. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5495.0s)]
*  But thankfully, the general, the general is what I call the one part of my brain that I try to keep the most dominant. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5497.0s)]
*  That where I tell myself, shut the fuck up. Shut up, stupid. Get in there. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5505.0s)]
*  This is not, this is unavoidable. Get in there. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5510.0s)]
*  I hear David Goggins in my, in my head, like, you know, like, shut up, you pussy. Get in there. Get in there. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5515.0s)]
*  Cold plunge. He's like, what does he say? Don't negotiate with yourself. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5523.0s)]
*  My son and I went on this race called the Great World Race, which is seven marathons, seven continents in seven days. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5527.0s)]
*  And I did a couple of half marathons and one full marathon. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5534.0s)]
*  But he did all seven marathons on all seven continents in seven days. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5538.0s)]
*  Banged up was he by the end of seven days. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5543.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was, this was in November. So he's 24 now. He's 23 at the time. So like five months ago. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5545.0s)]
*  And I guess at 23, you kind of feel like you can't be killed by a bullet. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5551.0s)]
*  Turns out by Cartagena, he was, he was feeling it. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5557.0s)]
*  But, but we took the David Goggins book with us and we read like I was reading like a chapter out of it every, every day. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5561.0s)]
*  But it was a crazy experience because so my son Cole and myself and my, my cameraman, my production guy went with us. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5567.0s)]
*  And initially I'm like, this is so awesome. We're going to see all seven continents in seven days. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5577.0s)]
*  We're going to see Antarctica. Two by the third marathon. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5581.0s)]
*  I, I was in just, I was so exhausted and in so, in so much pain. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5586.0s)]
*  I mean, I'd only done like half marathons when we got off the, got off the flight in Antarctica. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5593.0s)]
*  Every, all the, all the racers go out and start running. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5599.0s)]
*  I had these big Timberland boots on and this big puffy jacket. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5602.0s)]
*  And I was just sitting at the start line, just was going to wait for my son. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5605.0s)]
*  And I asked the race director, I'm like, how long are these loops? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5609.0s)]
*  He's like, well, there are six point whatever miles and, and there's four of them. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5613.0s)]
*  And I was like, I could easily do one of these. So I just started running. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5619.0s)]
*  In the Timberlands? In these size 14 Timberlands. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5623.0s)]
*  Which I, which I immediately regretted because then the snow starts caking to the, to the bottom of my Timberland. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5629.0s)]
*  So I ended up actually marching and not really running. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5636.0s)]
*  And it was so funny because my, my, my son has these spikes on. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5639.0s)]
*  So of course he lapsed me and he comes by. He's like, dad, what the fuck are you doing out here? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5642.0s)]
*  I thought I'd give it a whirl. So I actually made three loops. So I got 18 miles. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5648.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. He ran the whole 26.3. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5654.0s)]
*  Then you get on the plane and then you fly five and a half hours in economy sitting up like this. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5657.0s)]
*  You fly five and a half hours and you land in Cape Town, South Africa. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5663.0s)]
*  And you get off the plane and immediately run another marathon. Oh, and it's balls hot. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5666.0s)]
*  And, and then you, we packed up and from that marathon. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5673.0s)]
*  So now these marathons were only like five and a half hours, six hours apart. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5679.0s)]
*  So now you've done two marathons of 24 hours, one in Antarctica, one in the heat, South Africa. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5682.0s)]
*  And then it was like 11 hours to Perth, Australia. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5687.0s)]
*  And I ran another half there. He ran a full, full marathon there. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5692.0s)]
*  And then you're done in Perth, Australia and you pack up. We flew to Istanbul. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5696.0s)]
*  And the cool thing about Istanbul is you could, you could run on, on the Asian side and then run on the European side. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5700.0s)]
*  So this was like the only night we got to stay in a hotel room and actually take a shower. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5706.0s)]
*  And so we get to Istanbul and, and the marathon was supposed to be along this wharf. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5711.0s)]
*  It was like supposed to be, it's, it's pitch black at night. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5721.0s)]
*  And it's the, the dock is all broken apart. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5725.0s)]
*  You know, there's these big, huge cracks in the sidewalk and it was 26.3 miles along this wharf. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5730.0s)]
*  Only the thing was we were told that they were going to get all the fishermen off the wall. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5736.0s)]
*  And so it was lines and lines and lines of these guys fishing at night. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5741.0s)]
*  And it would take them. Oh, boy. And they would snap the hooks forward. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5745.0s)]
*  And so we get there and we're like, this is way too freaking dangerous. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5750.0s)]
*  And I guess the, the company that they had hired to clear all these fishermen just took their, took their money in and said the whole course was going to be lit. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5755.0s)]
*  Found out the course wasn't lit. So then you had to wear the headlamps. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5763.0s)]
*  And so it took them like an hour, around 20 minutes to clear all these fishermen. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5767.0s)]
*  But then we started running and we ran with those, you know, those headlights on. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5772.0s)]
*  And if you've ever been in a pitch black and you've just watched that light bounce in front of your eyes for, I don't know how my son did it. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5776.0s)]
*  Cause I ran for like an hour and a half and I was like, fuck this. I have nothing to prove. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5783.0s)]
*  I'm 53. I'm going to be 54. I'm like, I've already run a few half marathons. I feel really good. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5789.0s)]
*  So he ran the entire thing and I joined him for a bunch, a bunch of laps. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5797.0s)]
*  But finally he just ripped the thing off his head because that light shaking in front of your eyes for four hours at a time. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5801.0s)]
*  Pretty soon you just start to go batty. And then you, you go to sleep. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5809.0s)]
*  The next day you run in the Asian side. Then it was 19 hours to Cartagena. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5813.0s)]
*  And about a third of the athletes drank the water with the ice or ate the salad that was washed in the water from. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5818.0s)]
*  Oh no. And the worst monosumas revenge Joe, you could ever imagine. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5828.0s)]
*  Like a third of the plane wakes up six or seven hours into this 19 hour flight. Just puking both ends. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5833.0s)]
*  Oh boy. Lines outside the bathroom. Lines outside the bathroom. Squeezing your butthole shut trying to get in there in time. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5841.0s)]
*  People laying in the galleys just throwing up into the trash cans. Oh no. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5849.0s)]
*  And I swear by the time we had landed, my son had lost so much weight and he was just in the, and then we had a ho we get to the hotel room, which you actually didn't get to spend the night. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5855.0s)]
*  We, we got to the hotel room just to change and he's in there just puking, you know, crapping and finally gets his race gear on. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5864.0s)]
*  We go downstairs and like half, half of the athletes are like, look like they're on their deathbed. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5873.0s)]
*  And because we were late to Cartagena, the race goes off at like 1230 in the afternoon, 12 o'clock in the afternoon. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5878.0s)]
*  It's fricking 98 degrees, maybe a hundred degrees, 90% humidity. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5885.0s)]
*  It is the hottest, flattest, most unforgiving course. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5890.0s)]
*  I remember turning to my production, head of my production team is Max and, and I was like, Max, there's zero chance he's finishing this marathon. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5896.0s)]
*  Cause he'd already started at about 208, 210 pounds and he was probably 190 by this time. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5907.0s)]
*  And, and so I pull up next to my son and I was like, look, man, if you don't give up on this race, you know, I won't give up on you. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5912.0s)]
*  And I sincerely regretted that at like mile 16 or 18, saying that I would run the whole race with him because everything in I've never run a marathon. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5921.0s)]
*  So for that day, everything in my entire body hurt Joe. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5934.0s)]
*  Like, like I wasn't so much pain from the waist down that I think I was just completely numb. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5937.0s)]
*  And he was just going from port of body to port of body, puking and shitting, puking and shitting, puking and shitting. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5942.0s)]
*  And I was having these sentimental moments where I was like, man, I'm so, so happy to be out here with you, dude. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5948.0s)]
*  Like this is, we're going to look back on this one day and wish we were back here. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5954.0s)]
*  And he would look at me and go, dad, shut the fuck up. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5958.0s)]
*  That would quiet down for like another 30 or 40 minutes and I get sentimental again. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5964.0s)]
*  He told me to shut the fuck up again. We ended up finishing the race though. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5969.0s)]
*  I don't know how I don't know how he did it. He sifted little ounces of coconut water for that entire Cartagena race. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5972.0s)]
*  And then we had to get on the plane and fly to Miami to run the seventh one, which I didn't do. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5978.0s)]
*  He did. But I don't even know why I brought that up. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5982.0s)]
*  But it was a crazy, crazy moment. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5985.0s)]
*  There were these women that were running this race, I kid you not, that they had Montezuma's revenge so bad that they would leave the race course and run into the the bay that we were running beside and just shit themselves in the bay and then get back out and keep running the race. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=5988.0s)]
*  And the guy that set the world record in Antarctica left the course in an ambulance in Cartagena. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6003.0s)]
*  Wow. It was insane, man. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6010.0s)]
*  My friend Cam Haynes when he was preparing for one of those ultra runs when you run for three days, like 240 miles. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6013.0s)]
*  He was running a marathon a day while he was working an eight hour job. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6019.0s)]
*  He was running a marathon a day. A marathon a day. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6023.0s)]
*  There's a guy right now in Bahrain. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6027.0s)]
*  Staying with Sheik Nasser, who's the one of the sons of the king of Bahrain. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6032.0s)]
*  And he is running 150 full distance triathlons in 150 days. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6037.0s)]
*  When I was there, he was on 59. I kid you not. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6045.0s)]
*  It's amazing the body's potential if you just continue to push it. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6049.0s)]
*  The thing about Cam is Cam had been running for so long for so many years that he had this incredible base, this base of cardio. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6054.0s)]
*  He's used to doing 10 miles every day. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6061.0s)]
*  170, 160. That's kind of big for that. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6063.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's not. Well, his son is even fucking crazier. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6066.0s)]
*  His son just broke the world record in pull ups in 24 hours. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6069.0s)]
*  In pull ups? Yeah. I think he did 10,001 in 24 hours. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6074.0s)]
*  10,001 in 24 hours? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6080.0s)]
*  So he had broke the... So Goggins had a record. He broke Goggins record. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6082.0s)]
*  And then some cat in Australia. He's young. He's like 25. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6087.0s)]
*  He's an animal too. That's him. And he runs with jeans on, by the way. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6091.0s)]
*  Why? Just for fucking goof. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6095.0s)]
*  He runs with Origin jeans. Have you ever used those stretchy jeans that Origin makes? [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6097.0s)]
*  I think I have. They're fucking great. They're basically sweatpants. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6102.0s)]
*  I don't know if I'd run a marathon in them. They're basically sweatpants. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6105.0s)]
*  They give you no resistance. You can kick somebody in the head with them easy. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6107.0s)]
*  He's gifted though. You can tell that stride. He's just coordinated. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6110.0s)]
*  He's been living with a fucking animal his whole life. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6114.0s)]
*  So he came in seventh place in the Austin Marathon and he has not built like a marathon guy. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6117.0s)]
*  He's jacked. Yeah, he definitely is. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6123.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously he won the world pull up championship or world pull up record. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6125.0s)]
*  He is where I got one of the ideas to carry a lot of weight for like when I do 150 pounds of pull ups. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6129.0s)]
*  Oh, is that what he does? [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6136.0s)]
*  He did this thing where I think it's a mile. See if you can find it. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6138.0s)]
*  So he's carrying a sandbag and I believe he has a weight vest on as well. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6144.0s)]
*  And I think the overall weight is over 200 pounds and he goes over a mile with over 200 pounds. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6150.0s)]
*  Oh, just just just walking like on a track. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6156.0s)]
*  I'm going short distances when I'm carrying heavy weight. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6160.0s)]
*  But what I'm trying to do is, you know, Peter Attia talked about this too, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6162.0s)]
*  like the importance of the ability to carry weight and walk with it. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6166.0s)]
*  And then there's this guy Tom about the centenarian decathlon. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6170.0s)]
*  Yes. And then there's this guy in Australia who's like an incredible freak. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6174.0s)]
*  His name is Tom Haviland and he's an enormous guy. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6179.0s)]
*  He's like six foot seven close to 300 pounds. Just close to 400. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6183.0s)]
*  Right. Isn't he like closing in on 400 pounds and he's muscle jacked, jacked. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6189.0s)]
*  And one of the things that he does is a part of his he does like very unusual workout routines. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6196.0s)]
*  Let's see if you can find some videos on that's what he looks like. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6203.0s)]
*  I mean, just a fucking complete freak. But he does like to. Yes. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6205.0s)]
*  Enormous guy, too. I mean, he's a huge guy, but he does a lot of his workouts are not just like normal [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6210.0s)]
*  deadlifts, bench press, all that kind of shit. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6218.0s)]
*  Some of his workouts he does carries things like he carries things like off one side or another side. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6221.0s)]
*  Go to his Instagram so I can pick one. A lot of these are just mostly you see just his back. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6229.0s)]
*  Why? When he films. I don't know. He's a psychopath. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6234.0s)]
*  He has to be out of his fucking mind just to be doing this because he's one literally one of the strongest guys in the world. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6237.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Does he participate in like strongman competitions? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6242.0s)]
*  I don't think he does. I think he just does all this shit on his own and I don't even understand why. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6244.0s)]
*  So what does he weigh now? 302 pounds. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6249.0s)]
*  He drinks. He eats 6570 calories a day. Yeah. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6253.0s)]
*  And three thousand two hundred and no excuse me. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6257.0s)]
*  Three hundred twenty nine grams of protein, eight hundred and fourteen grams of carbs, two hundred and twenty two grams of fat. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6261.0s)]
*  And so he was. That's the current phase, which is a deficit. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6268.0s)]
*  Yeah. This was him on his way to. So go back to that. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6272.0s)]
*  Yeah. So he's at three hundred forty pounds. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6276.0s)]
*  I think he was trying to get to four hundred pounds at one point in time. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6280.0s)]
*  But one of the things he does a lot is carry stuff. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6283.0s)]
*  And so I started looking into this idea like what what what is it? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6288.0s)]
*  What's the big deal about carrying and walking with stuff? So he does this like how much weight is that motherfucker guy carrying around with them? [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6292.0s)]
*  How many plates is that? I mean, five hundred pounds. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6299.0s)]
*  What is that? One, two, three, four, five, ten plates. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6304.0s)]
*  So it's somewhere around. Yeah. And so he's just walking short distances with this. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6309.0s)]
*  So I started doing that in my yard. So I started doing it with farmers, carries. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6315.0s)]
*  And, you know, when I rock, I just use the forty five pound plate when I go a couple of miles with the dog. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6320.0s)]
*  What's with the back? I mean, why isn't he? He's just a fucking psychopath. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6325.0s)]
*  Why does he have all clothes on, too? Because if he takes the clothes off, he's super impressive. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6328.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah, he's fucking ripped. I mean, the guy's enormous. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6332.0s)]
*  I forget his background. Yeah, that's him. That's what he looks like. Dude. Yeah. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6337.0s)]
*  And again, he's like six, seven or something crazy like that built that way. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6342.0s)]
*  Wow. But he does a lot of carrying stuff and walking stuff. Yeah. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6347.0s)]
*  He feels like it's very important for like your overall strength. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6351.0s)]
*  I think I would agree with that. Not just to be able to sit there and push stuff and do squats in place, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6355.0s)]
*  but to move with things where you're balancing and counterbalancing, moving left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6360.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think there's a real benefit to that. I like to single arm, you know, farmer carry. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6367.0s)]
*  Yeah. It makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Especially just trying to stabilize your spine. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6373.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do that with like a 70 pound kettlebell and I'll just walk up a hill with a 70 pound kettlebell. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6377.0s)]
*  And I can't get very far before I have to put it down because my grip gives out. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6382.0s)]
*  But I won't use straps because I think I really want to like I've been doing a lot of I carry this fucker around with me too, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6385.0s)]
*  because we have this thing in the comedy club where it's like one of those strength. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6391.0s)]
*  It has a counter. Yeah. And I got to 161 pounds of how strong you can squeeze. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6397.0s)]
*  It's the hardest I ever got. And so I want to get to 180. So I've been just just grip strength. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6404.0s)]
*  Just hold that motherfucker all the time. You got to get some meaty paws there, bro. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6410.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got to put it against. Yeah. Just hold that motherfucker. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6415.0s)]
*  I feel like hands. You have to get angry. No, I do. I like to get angry. I just like to get angry if I can. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6420.0s)]
*  But hand strength, I think is very important. Yeah. Most of my workout talks about grip strength and it's very important. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6425.0s)]
*  I do a lot of hanging too. I do a lot of hanging from my back of my shoulders to just hang from a chin up bar. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6432.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's good. How long can you dead hang? Two minutes. OK. I'm just just out there myself. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6438.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just around two minutes. I put those weighted vests on and that's a good way to do it. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6443.0s)]
*  Yeah. Weighted vest for short bursts. Yeah. I'll take like a 12 pound weighted Aeon vest. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6448.0s)]
*  And and I don't think you could do it with a rock. But but I do those those 12 pound Aeon vest. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6453.0s)]
*  I just hang like this. This is the one one of them to this one's about 12 pounds. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6459.0s)]
*  12 pounds. But yeah, I do one series of all body weight workouts where I do chin ups, push ups and then L chin up L. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6463.0s)]
*  I guess you would be pull ups where it's a tight grip. And you know, by L meaning I lift my legs up and I hold them in position. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6471.0s)]
*  And I saw Dino's got me doing that now. So I do that most of the time with no extra weight. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6479.0s)]
*  But like two times a month, I'll do it with 25 pounds. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6486.0s)]
*  So I put a 25 pound vest on and do my entire routine with long like a rock vest. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6491.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's actually from go rock. It's 25 pound. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6497.0s)]
*  It's like a like a, you know, just strap it in, Velcro it down. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6502.0s)]
*  And so I'll do my series of tension ups, my series of 20 20 dips and then 10 L L pull ups. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6506.0s)]
*  But you're talking like the L sits where you're holding the bars and you just put your feet straight out. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6513.0s)]
*  You put your feet tougher than they look. I'm not holding the bar down here. I'm doing chin ups. Oh, chin ups. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6517.0s)]
*  So I'm doing the L like this. And then I'm doing these with my foot straight out. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6522.0s)]
*  So it's the abs. It's like I'm just trying. I've had like a problem with my lower back. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6526.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of it came from I know where it came from. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6531.0s)]
*  It came from archery where I was spending too much time pulling one side only. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6535.0s)]
*  And then also I was getting a little bit of tendonitis and I was just saying fuck it. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6542.0s)]
*  Just working through it. You try to shoot both sides with your bow now. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6547.0s)]
*  No. But what I do now is because my bow is pretty heavy. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6550.0s)]
*  It's 85 pounds to pull it back. But I'm doing it like when I'm really training hard, like it's getting close to September. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6554.0s)]
*  I'm probably shooting 100 times a day. So I'm 100 times I'm pulling back 85 pounds. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6560.0s)]
*  So now what I do and I learned this from Cam, I take a 10 pound dumbbell and I hold it with my right arm. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6565.0s)]
*  Because I pull my bow with my right arm. So I put a 10 pound dumbbell with my right arm and hold it out. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6572.0s)]
*  And then with my left arm, I have a cable like a cable machine and I'm pulling back the same. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6578.0s)]
*  I'm mimicking the exact same motion of archery. I see. I'm holding and can't. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6584.0s)]
*  So you're doing this in a gym on a yes like with just a hand weight. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6589.0s)]
*  So I'm holding it like that and then I'm using the pulley and I'm pulling the cables back and I'm holding it for a count of two and then bringing it back. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6592.0s)]
*  Holding it for a count of two and bringing it back. So I'm balancing out my back. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6601.0s)]
*  Are you a lefty or a righty? So your righty is that's where you're holding your bow. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6605.0s)]
*  So my right arm I'm pulling back. I'm holding the bow with my left arm to stabilize it and I'm pulling it back with my right arm. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6609.0s)]
*  So now to counter that, I immediately go to the gym right after. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6615.0s)]
*  So one of the things I'm noticing is like, boy, I get fucking so sore on my left side now because this is fairly recent. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6620.0s)]
*  I've only been doing this for a couple of months. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6627.0s)]
*  The left side to stabilize it. But I think I should have been doing it the entire time. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6629.0s)]
*  And because I was getting like really bad lower back pain last hunting season and it was just because of tendons. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6633.0s)]
*  And I'm not just overusing because you're stabilizing. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6640.0s)]
*  Right. So you're pulling back the bow and you're holding it in place and you're stabilizing on your right side. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6643.0s)]
*  And after your your form kind of breaks down, plus all that, you get a little tired. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6649.0s)]
*  Now I just when my feeling, I form breaking down, I stop. I just stop shooting. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6653.0s)]
*  So instead of shooting 100 times a day now, maybe I'll shoot 30 or 40 and I just stop. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6657.0s)]
*  I won't push because it's a meathead mentality that my stupid brain like won't abandon, even though I know it's like injuring me. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6662.0s)]
*  But this this is it. It actually it became a problem and it was hurting me when I was playing pool. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6673.0s)]
*  And I did a bunch of things to deal with it. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6678.0s)]
*  One of the things I did is this thing called New Fit where they put which helped a lot where they put electrodes on your muscles. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6680.0s)]
*  And then you go through a series of core routines while you're doing that. That helped a lot. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6687.0s)]
*  That's cool. And then incorporating rotational exercises helped a lot. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6691.0s)]
*  So I have like a golf looking now I have a bar like a straight bar and I'll put like my right leg forward. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6696.0s)]
*  And so I've got the bar back on the right side and I'm twisting forward. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6704.0s)]
*  So I'm doing that. So a lot of rotational exercise and I'm also twisting up, you know, and I'm doing a bunch of different things to twist. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6708.0s)]
*  Another thing I do is I sit on a pad with my legs elevated and I have a kettlebell and I'll twist it to the side with my legs up in the air. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6716.0s)]
*  So I'm getting all this rotational exercises into my system now that I didn't used to do before. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6725.0s)]
*  But I really should have been doing from the beginning. I always did abs. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6731.0s)]
*  You know, I always did, you know, the hip glute thing where you're you lean all the way back. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6735.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. GHD sit up. Yeah. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6741.0s)]
*  So yeah, so I do. I used to do a lot. Yeah, those are still do a lot of those. Yeah. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6743.0s)]
*  And then back extensions. But I wasn't doing rotational stuff. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6747.0s)]
*  And I think that's the difference. When do you actually when does hunting season for you? December? [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6751.0s)]
*  September. Oh, September. Yeah. And where do you go? Like Utah or Wyoming? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6755.0s)]
*  Yeah, the photo that you were asking about out front. That's Utah. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6759.0s)]
*  Oh, that's Utah. It's beautiful. And you offer like a week and you just gorgeous. Love it. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6762.0s)]
*  Yeah. Somebody's ranch out there. It's just so lovely. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6767.0s)]
*  I love it too. Everything about it is great. It's just I look forward to it so much. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6770.0s)]
*  That's why I love the mountains. Like, you know, honestly, I think our long term plan is to we've got a beautiful place in Miami is to is to sell that place and get a spot. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6773.0s)]
*  I mean, it's continued to develop our spot in Colorado because there's something about these authentic log cabins, glacier fed spring water, Wilin septic, you know, solar fed electricity. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6782.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like just old school. Old school. And it makes you so happy. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6794.0s)]
*  And I totally agree with you. I wish I wish that people could feel what that feeling is like and they wouldn't chase a lot of other. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6798.0s)]
*  Well, I think there's also some intangible input that you're getting from society that you're not thinking about. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6806.0s)]
*  But that affects you. That's absent when you're in the woods and you feel refreshed. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6815.0s)]
*  It's a connection to Mother Nature. I mean, it's a connection to life. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6819.0s)]
*  I think that we've gotten so. But I also think the absence of society is a thing. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6822.0s)]
*  I think I mean, this is going to sound super kooky, but I think even Wi-Fi and cell phone signals, I think they have an effect on you. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6827.0s)]
*  I don't know how much of an effect. I think you'd be fine. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6836.0s)]
*  I'll tell you a story, a true story about home. So my house, we have this week when my wife and I sleep in an EMF free tent. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6839.0s)]
*  I went a little nuts with the biohacking here. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6846.0s)]
*  Sleeping a tent? [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6848.0s)]
*  You know, so every night that we're home in Miami. So it's a PVC frame. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6849.0s)]
*  You know, it's like five and a half feet tall, six foot tall, a little frame. It's just PVC. It's dirty. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6855.0s)]
*  And then draped over top of it is pure woven silver fabric. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6861.0s)]
*  So it looks like a mosquito net that's over our king size bed. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6865.0s)]
*  And in the back of our bed, it clips into this grounding mattress, which plugs into the wall. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6868.0s)]
*  So the whole cage is grounded and there's no 5G, no Wi-Fi. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6873.0s)]
*  That's it right there. Jamie's got a photo of it. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6877.0s)]
*  Oh, that's exactly it. That is literally exactly it. I wonder if there. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6879.0s)]
*  So that protects you from EMF? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6884.0s)]
*  I wonder if you put Gary Brekka's bed in there if it would show it, because I put it on Instagram. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6886.0s)]
*  Is that what you do? [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6889.0s)]
*  That's exactly what we sleep in. Exactly that. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6890.0s)]
*  EMF shielding canopy. See, this is like kooky. This is where you and I separate. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6892.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6897.0s)]
*  I tried to bring that up. My wife would smack me. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6898.0s)]
*  Dude, I also have a hyperbaric chamber in our bedroom. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6900.0s)]
*  I have a hyperbaric chamber. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6902.0s)]
*  In the bedroom? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6903.0s)]
*  No, in my house. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6904.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. I've got my podcast studio inside of one now. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6905.0s)]
*  Inside of a hyperbaric chamber? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6908.0s)]
*  Inside of a hyperbaric chamber. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6910.0s)]
*  How big is your hyperbaric chamber? [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6911.0s)]
*  Huge. It's got two Maybach seats in it. It's got like a 52-inch or 54-inch TV. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6912.0s)]
*  It's got three AI-powered cameras. My gym is in the hyperbaric too. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6918.0s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6921.0s)]
*  I have a rower and weights, like a whole set of weights inside of it. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6923.0s)]
*  There's a risk of using electronics in a high oxygen environment, isn't there? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6926.0s)]
*  You don't use a high oxygen environment. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6930.0s)]
*  I don't think there's any reason to go into a 100% O2 chamber. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6932.0s)]
*  I mean, none of my chambers will go to 100% O2, so none of them are flammable. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6936.0s)]
*  You could have a candle inside of there. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6940.0s)]
*  Theoretically, I don't suggest it, but you could. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6941.0s)]
*  They would tell you to not even wear certain kinds of clothes in the hyperbaric chamber. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6944.0s)]
*  Yeah, because if you have 100% O2, you can have static electricity. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6948.0s)]
*  You can light a spark and it could explode. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6951.0s)]
*  So what is 100% O2 versus like what you're doing? [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6953.0s)]
*  So you have to actually put medical-grade oxygen into the chamber, which I don't do. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6956.0s)]
*  You don't. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6960.0s)]
*  So the one that I used to go to, they would give you a mask and you would wear the mask [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6961.0s)]
*  and oxygen would get pumped into your mask while you're in the hyperbaric chamber. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6965.0s)]
*  Yeah, so that's also not flammable. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6969.0s)]
*  That's probably 92, 93% O2. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6970.0s)]
*  Pure oxygen, 100% oxygen is flammable. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6974.0s)]
*  It's just like pure hydrogen gas is flammable. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6977.0s)]
*  So 100% O2 is flammable. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6979.0s)]
*  I mean, that terrible accident that happened to that young boy in the Midwest here recently [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6981.0s)]
*  where the hyperbaric chamber actually exploded. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6985.0s)]
*  What happened? [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6988.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this young, I think it was five and a half year old little boy was in a hyperbaric chamber. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6989.0s)]
*  And very sadly, the technician left him in there, didn't ground him. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=6996.0s)]
*  And he had a blanket in there with him and he moved the blanket and the static electricity, you know, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7000.0s)]
*  100% O2 exploded. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7008.0s)]
*  His mother was injured too. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7010.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7011.0s)]
*  I want to say that both of the nurse and doctor in the clinic are in charge with manslaughter. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7012.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7018.0s)]
*  Terrible. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7019.0s)]
*  But those are 100% O2 chambers. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7020.0s)]
*  It's clear, it means important to make the distinction that these 100% oxygen chambers, [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7023.0s)]
*  I mean, these are bombs. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7029.0s)]
*  And why would you have 100% O2 chamber versus what you talk about? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7031.0s)]
*  So if you look at some of the therapeutic benefits for things like diabetic ulcers, burns, things like that, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7035.0s)]
*  where, you know, necrosis, tissue necrosis, those make sense in a supervised hospital environment with, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7041.0s)]
*  you know, someone standing right outside the chamber the entire time. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7050.0s)]
*  I've been in one one time in a place called Bioxcellerator in Medellin, Colombia. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7055.0s)]
*  But the home use chambers where you get a prescription from your doctor and you actually get it probably what you have, [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7060.0s)]
*  is yours a soft shell? [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7067.0s)]
*  No. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7068.0s)]
*  Chamber? [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7069.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7070.0s)]
*  So that'll probably go to two atmospheres of pressure. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7071.0s)]
*  That's really good. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7073.0s)]
*  So Dr. Jason Saunders, who wrote the book Hyperbaric Medicine with Dr. Dimitri, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7074.0s)]
*  will tell you there's a lot of benefits at low pressures, like 1.3 atmospheres, which you can get in a soft chamber. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7080.0s)]
*  And there are a lot of benefits at higher pressures, like two atmospheres. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7087.0s)]
*  So I never go above two atmospheres, twice the atmospheric pressure. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7090.0s)]
*  If you think about what's happening at twice the atmospheric pressure, you're taking the oxygen from the air, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7094.0s)]
*  which is about 21 percent sea level where we're breathing right now, and you're doubling that because you're doubling the pressure. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7098.0s)]
*  So every 33 feet you go below sea level, you double the atmospheric pressure. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7104.0s)]
*  So when you get to two atmospheres of pressure, you're essentially taking in twice as much oxygen. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7109.0s)]
*  The oxygen concentration hasn't increased, but the size of the gas has gotten smaller. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7115.0s)]
*  So now you're perfusing tissues with oxygen that normally wouldn't be as perfused with oxygen. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7122.0s)]
*  You can also put on a nasal cannulus and get 92, 93 percent O2, but that's also not flammable. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7129.0s)]
*  If you took a nasal cannulus from an oxygen concentrator, like one that works for your EWOD or something, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7135.0s)]
*  and you let a lighter in front of it, that gas is not going to catch fire. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7142.0s)]
*  100 percent O2 is flammable and very dangerous. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7147.0s)]
*  So what's the benefit of 100 percent O2? [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7152.0s)]
*  Just a higher concentration of oxygen for things like diabetic ulcers. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7154.0s)]
*  When you have anaerobic bacterial infections, meaning bacterial infections that do not thrive on oxygen, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7159.0s)]
*  you have to be careful with aerobic bacteria because there are bacteria that actually feed on oxygen as well. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7171.0s)]
*  And so you don't want to put somebody who has an aerobic infection into a hyperbaric chamber. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7177.0s)]
*  You want to put somebody who has an anaerobic infection into a hyperbaric chamber. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7182.0s)]
*  But what's really interesting is some of the research that's coming out of Israel, especially on cognitive function, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7187.0s)]
*  using 60 days at two atmospheres of pressure and then reducing the pressure over time. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7195.0s)]
*  You know, the improvement in mitochondrial density, the improvement in blood flow, cognitive scoring, reduction of neural inflammation. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7201.0s)]
*  I know you can't say treat or cure, but they use these to modulate autism, all kinds of neural inflammatory conditions, [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7212.0s)]
*  Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, which is really linked to type 3 diabetes, which is insulin resistance in the brain. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7223.0s)]
*  But the byproduct of that is this neural inflammatory cascade. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7230.0s)]
*  So reducing neural inflammation, you know, there are a lot of benefits to hyperbaric tissue recovery, post-surgical wound repair, post-surgical recovery. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7234.0s)]
*  You know, these things have pretty profound. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7243.0s)]
*  There's also a study out of Israel that showed the lengthening of telomeres when they did a protocol of 60 sessions, 90 minute sessions over 90 days. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7246.0s)]
*  Yes, 60 days or 60 sessions in 90 days. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7256.0s)]
*  60 sessions in 90 days, 60 90 minute sessions in 90 days. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7261.0s)]
*  You're right. Yeah. Dr. Saunders talked about that a lot, too. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7266.0s)]
*  And they showed telomere lengthening, which was the biological equivalent of a decrease of age of 20 years. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7269.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's a chromosomal end cap. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7278.0s)]
*  And if you think about it, I have a saying that the presence of oxygen is the absence of disease. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7280.0s)]
*  And I truly believe that because if you look at the breakdown in mitochondrial respiration, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7285.0s)]
*  which occurs when you deprive the mitochondria of all kinds of things, but mainly of oxygen, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7290.0s)]
*  which is our fuel source, you know, which is not not our fuel source as humans, our fuel source is ATP, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7295.0s)]
*  but the fuel source for the mitochondria is mainly oxygen. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7302.0s)]
*  And when you feed it oxygen, you have a 16-fold step up in cellular energy. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7307.0s)]
*  When you deprive it of oxygen, you have a 16-fold step down in cellular energy. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7311.0s)]
*  I mean, the difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration or the Krebs cycle, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7316.0s)]
*  having the presence of oxygen or not having the presence of oxygen is a pretty substantial number. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7320.0s)]
*  And so hyperbarics, because they allow for compressed oxygen, even if you don't increase the percentage of O2, right? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7325.0s)]
*  You take it, you keep it at 21 percent like we're breathing right now, but you just double the atmospheric pressure. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7337.0s)]
*  I mean, the effects are pretty profound. And I believe the risks are low. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7342.0s)]
*  If you have a physician, you understand how to operate the chamber and you have safety procedures and you're not using 100 percent O2 and you're you're at shallow depths. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7348.0s)]
*  You can ascend quickly without being in trouble. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7356.0s)]
*  If you're a diver, you understand dive tables. You have to ascend at certain rates and pause at certain levels. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7359.0s)]
*  So the one that that I I built, I was like, man, how do I just compress time? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7364.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, I'm going to work out. So what if I was able to put the gym in there? [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7370.0s)]
*  I remember the guy thought I was out of my fricking mind. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7375.0s)]
*  It does sound crazy. Yeah, but it's got it. It's got a Nord track rower in there. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7380.0s)]
*  And how big is it? Wait, the size of this room? It's pretty big. Let me see if I can show you a picture of it. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7385.0s)]
*  That would be a great way to like compress time. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7391.0s)]
*  Because you feel more than one thing getting out of the same time. You feel amazing. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7395.0s)]
*  That's actually my son working in it. Wow, that's crazy. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7400.0s)]
*  That's my son, Dylan. We went in there working out in a hyperbaric chamber. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7404.0s)]
*  And you could kind of watch Netflix in there, too. Yeah. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7408.0s)]
*  You got a screen in there and everything. Wow. And it's got. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7411.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're just jamming some music. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7416.0s)]
*  Wow. So I was playing some rap music. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7421.0s)]
*  I got a sound bar in there. That's pretty dope. Yeah, it was pretty cool. That's awesome. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7428.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just lay down in mine and listen to books. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7432.0s)]
*  Well, the other one you can lay down in, it's got these seats that recline. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7436.0s)]
*  It's got a television in it, too. So I go in there watching news sometimes. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7440.0s)]
*  Oh, that's great. Yeah, my wife and daughter goes in there and they just take a nap. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7444.0s)]
*  I was talking to Dana about it, like how beneficial it is. Like, how much time does it take? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7448.0s)]
*  I'm like, it's about two hours. And he's like, I don't have that fucking time. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7451.0s)]
*  I know everything you got to do something you do in the red light. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7455.0s)]
*  You know, that's how I try to compress time. Yeah. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7458.0s)]
*  Just like if you could get the hydrogen into the cold tub. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7461.0s)]
*  I mean, he's going to be he's going to be at my my house tomorrow. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7464.0s)]
*  So we're going to try to how much of those little bombs for the bath, the hydrogen bombs. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7467.0s)]
*  I know they're about to come out with them. I don't know if you can order them on the site yet. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7472.0s)]
*  I think they're probably going to be if it's if it's 30 bucks for 30 of those H2 tabs, [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7476.0s)]
*  then I would imagine they're going to be around five or 10 bucks. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7482.0s)]
*  OK, 10 bucks for a hydrogen bomb to drop into the that's to the bathtub. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7485.0s)]
*  I mean, the machine is, you know, I was actually originally going to order this [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7490.0s)]
*  electrolysis system called a cocoon or it's spelled cake when like the facility out in Las Vegas, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7494.0s)]
*  which makes oxygen water. That system is like one hundred and ten thousand dollars. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7502.0s)]
*  And then a buddy of mine, Tyler LeBaron, who's the Ph.D. in the space, [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7507.0s)]
*  told me about this machine I could order from Korea for seventy five hundred dollars, [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7512.0s)]
*  which is the one that I have now. And now I've added a nano bubble machine. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7516.0s)]
*  And that one's just incredible. I mean, for for this transdermal inflammation. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7523.0s)]
*  And I think for for people that have like, you know, [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7528.0s)]
*  chronic injuries, especially like chronic repetitive use injuries or they have real [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7533.0s)]
*  severe low back pain or they've got parents or something that are deconditioned, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7537.0s)]
*  you know, that have a hard time exercising. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7541.0s)]
*  You know, these are these are, you know, great things to do to lower their inflammatory. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7545.0s)]
*  You know that and there's something called EWOD exercise with oxygen therapy, [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7550.0s)]
*  which is kind of based on Otto Warburg's research where and I do this with my parents [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7555.0s)]
*  because both of my parents are deconditioned. My mom has dual knee replacements and my dad's [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7559.0s)]
*  handicapped from a boating accident years ago. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7563.0s)]
*  He has no cognitive impairment, but he has some motor coordination difficulties. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7567.0s)]
*  So it's hard for him to really exercise. And I I bought them a sauna [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7570.0s)]
*  and I put them both in a sauna for 20 minutes, three times a week. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7575.0s)]
*  And they just breathe. I bought a hole and they just breathe through a nasal cannulus. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7580.0s)]
*  The 92, 93 percent or two, which is a version of EWOD, the exercise with oxygen therapy [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7584.0s)]
*  or the multi-step oxygen therapy, because if you just can raise their heart rate just, [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7589.0s)]
*  you know, a little bit with the heat, then that extra perfusion pressure really drives oxygen [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7594.0s)]
*  into the tissues. And I'll tell you, it's a noticeable change in them. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7599.0s)]
*  Just like when you get out of a cold punch, you had a really good workout. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7603.0s)]
*  Well, imagine, you know, you're elderly and you're deconditioned, you know, you really don't get your heart rate up. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7607.0s)]
*  You really don't get your good sweat on. But you go into a sauna, raise your heart rate [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7612.0s)]
*  and breathe some of that 92, 93 percent of it to you. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7617.0s)]
*  They they feel amazing getting out of there. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7620.0s)]
*  This is a kind of important thing to talk about, because there was a study that was released recently [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7623.0s)]
*  that showed that when people use the cold plunge after workout, you see a decrease in hypertrophy. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7627.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course you do. Yeah, this is a terrible study. Right. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7632.0s)]
*  But I was so pissed off to see that. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7635.0s)]
*  Because people told you it doesn't work. All these pussies that don't want to get in that cold water. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7637.0s)]
*  Folks, you do the cold before. This is the way to do it. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7642.0s)]
*  I know it sucks. Do the cold before you work out or wait several hours after you work out and then you cold plunge. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7646.0s)]
*  Right. I totally agree. I mean, if you think about what you get from cold punching, let's not overblow it or underblow it. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7654.0s)]
*  I mean, but, you know, you get well, first of all, if you if you exercised intensely, [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7659.0s)]
*  let's say you did a big squat workout and you tore a bunch of quad muscle, what's going to happen? [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7666.0s)]
*  Inflammation. What's the body going to do? Yeah, the body's going to send more blood flow, more amino acids, more more oxygen to those muscles. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7671.0s)]
*  It's going to pull inflammatory factors like creatinine, you know, the breakdown of muscle, the byproduct of muscle breakdown. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7678.0s)]
*  It's going to pull that out. So why would you want to stop? It's creatinine creatinine. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7684.0s)]
*  OK, creatine is right. Right. Right. I never knew how to say that word, though. I've seen it. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7690.0s)]
*  Yeah, which which is actually very good for. Yeah. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7694.0s)]
*  So because I know there was a fighter that was actually pulled from a fight once because he had high creatinine levels. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7697.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a kidney issue. It's actually a sign of rhabdomyolytis. Right. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7703.0s)]
*  Over training. Yeah. So that makes sense because he was a psycho. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7708.0s)]
*  Yeah. You start to break down. So creatinine is is a byproduct of muscle breakdown. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7712.0s)]
*  It's perfectly normal to have creatinine in the blood, but when it gets very high. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7718.0s)]
*  So there's usually three markers they look at for kidney health. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7722.0s)]
*  One is called blood, urea, nitrogen, bun. One is called creatinine. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7726.0s)]
*  This breakdown of muscle byproduct and rhabdo is when your muscles start to break down at a rate that your kidneys can't clear it. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7730.0s)]
*  A lot of people that go too hard when they're not in shape, like they did too many CrossFit classes, they get rhabdo. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7738.0s)]
*  Yes, they get rhabdo. And what's interesting is, you know, a lot of a lot of athletes, really conditioned athletes, [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7744.0s)]
*  get it too, because they have a tendency to be mentally a lot stronger than their bodies. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7751.0s)]
*  That's the problem. That meathead mentality that I was talking about that led to me having this tendon issue in my lower back. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7755.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I was worried that it was a disc issue, but it's not in the disc. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7761.0s)]
*  It's like right here on the right hip area where it's like the stabilizing muscle. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7765.0s)]
*  But you so you think about it. OK, so the the blood and then there's something on EGFR, which is your kidney filtration rate, right? [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7770.0s)]
*  Which is your glomerular filtration rate. It's how quickly is the blood moving through your kidneys? [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7778.0s)]
*  Because about 15 times every day, the full volume of your blood goes through your kidneys. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7783.0s)]
*  If you think about what happens when you get into a cold plunge. So first you get this peripheral vasoconstriction. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7788.0s)]
*  Then you get a release of something called cold shock proteins. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7795.0s)]
*  And if you ever really want to have some fun, just Google around about cold shock proteins. Look at Lin 28A and Lin 28B. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7800.0s)]
*  These are cold shock proteins that are being actually researched for their impact on insulin sensitivity, improving insulin sensitivity. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7807.0s)]
*  And then, you know, you activate a very special type of fat called brown fat, which essentially exchanges a calorie for a measure of heat. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7815.0s)]
*  So it takes a calorie and turns it into heat. And that's a very good thing. If I'm taking calories and turning them into heat, you know, there's a cost to raising your thermostat. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7822.0s)]
*  And you think if you're in, let's say, 50 degree water and you get out of 50 degree water and you're standing in a 70 degree room, how's your body go to 98.6? [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7831.0s)]
*  Right. How do you actually get not only how do you exceed the temperature of the room you're in? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7841.0s)]
*  Well, your metabolism is raised largely because of the activation of brown fat. And there's a cost to that. The cost is calories. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7847.0s)]
*  So anybody tells you that not cold plunging is not good for burning fat, I think is missing the the breath of the science. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7855.0s)]
*  And then the final thing you get is you get this spike of dopamine. Yes. Last hours. Yes. And that's where you get that like laser focus. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7864.0s)]
*  I feel fucking amazing. You feel so good. You're never in a bad mood getting out of a cold punch. Right. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7870.0s)]
*  That's another thing that if you could give that to people in a pill, they'd be like, oh, my God, I found the best antidepressant. Yeah. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7875.0s)]
*  So true. Well, one thing is beneficial, though, post workout is sauna. Right. In beneficial for muscle growth. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7881.0s)]
*  Yes. And also as a static cardio. Correct. Because your heart rates already elevate. I like to go in literally the moment I put the weights down, I get right into that 196 degree. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7888.0s)]
*  That 20th minute's tough, though, bro. The 25th minute's even tougher. Oh, you go. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7899.0s)]
*  The last five. I used to get to the 20 and I'd be like, OK, finally. And then the fucking general started talking. No. Yeah. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7905.0s)]
*  Come on, pussy. Five more minutes. Oh, no. And the thing is, too, when I'm in the sauna, I'm not just sitting there. I'm hard stretching. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7912.0s)]
*  I do deep stretches, which is exhausting, too, because it's it's hard to do. And I'm holding like deep static stretches. You're pretty flexible. Yeah. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7920.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's so good. That's because I keep it. I mean, I'm 57. I keep my flexibility. Yeah. Yeah. Going to the sauna post. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7929.0s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of people as they get older, they lose that flexibility. And I think that's another thing that I actually if I'm criticizing myself, I didn't do enough of before I started fucking my lower back up. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7936.0s)]
*  Lower back's pretty solid now, though. It's still like it irritates me sometimes when I wake up in the morning, but it's nothing that stops me from doing anything. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7949.0s)]
*  I can still kick the bag, which is that was the big one, like because there's so much torque involved in the. Oh, yeah. When you're kicking the bag. And I hate not being able to do that. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7956.0s)]
*  So the fact that I can still get those workouts in is really huge for me. That is the absolute best stress reliever in the history. Oh, kicking bags. Mother Earth. Yeah. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7966.0s)]
*  Hitting a bag. Put put some 16 ounce gloves on, set a timer and start doing rounds on the bag. Start slow and you know, we start at like 30 seconds a minute. No, I do three minute rounds. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7977.0s)]
*  Three minutes rounds and then one minute rest, three minute rounds. But the first few rounds while I'm warming up, I'm just kind of tap and I'm like, [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7989.0s)]
*  I'm not full blast in it, but then around round four when I'm really sweating and I start to dig in and then what I do, what I do is I have two different timers. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=7997.0s)]
*  And one of them have this ringside timer that will give you these 30 second like dings. So to give you three minutes, but it gives a different sound that goes off at 30 seconds. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8010.0s)]
*  And so that's like, you know, halfway through the minute. No. So you know when to sprint. So you have sprinting times and then you have other times where you're sort of coasting and then the number goes off and they sprint. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8021.0s)]
*  And then I'll also do Tabata's and so Tabata's that protocols 20 seconds work, 10 seconds rest. So I do that protocol. My favorite way to do that one is actually on the air dine. So I have that air dine. Yeah. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8032.0s)]
*  The rogue machine is the best. It's called the echo bike. Rogue is like made. They make this. It's such a sturdy fucking rock solid piece of equipment. You mean rogue air and again. Yeah, it's a rogue one though. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8046.0s)]
*  They call it the echo. I see them over there. Get a picture of the rogue one. It's much sturdier than the other ones that I've seen. And so I do. And it has Tabata built into the system. So you can just do that. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8061.0s)]
*  So brutal. Yeah. So it's eight eight reps of this. So 20 second sprint, 10 second rest, 20 seconds sprint, eight, 10 second rest. You do that for eight a series of eight. So that's the rogue one. It's real thick and robust. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8072.0s)]
*  And you go fucking hammer. It's called the echo bike. Yeah. Is for me the best way to increase my cardio that Tabata protocol. I don't know. Some guy named Tabata invented that protocol. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8086.0s)]
*  But what is that treadmill with the weight? Yeah. Oh, the hit treadmill. Yeah, that's great, too. Yeah. I ordered one of those. You walk in with weight. Yeah. So it's like a farmer's exactly. But you're going uphill on a treadmill. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8099.0s)]
*  It's all about work, you know, getting your body to slowly build up to more and more work. Make sure you take a mineral salts when you do. Oh, I take a lot of shit. Yeah. Yeah. I'm what do you take? Well, I use element. You know, yeah, element tea. Yeah, that stuff. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8113.0s)]
*  And I put a bar. I'm addicted to that chili mango flavor. Oh, it's so good. Oh, development tea. Oh, it's so spicy. A little bit. Really? Touch. Just a touch of spice. I really like it. So I'll have like a 64 ounce water with four of those poured into it. Oh, 64 ounces. Yeah. And so I'm just hammering it. So but that's made a giant impact in cramps. I don't get cramps. Yeah, a lot of people think that, you know, sodium is it's funny how many people think that. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8135.0s)]
*  Sodium is it's funny how many people think sodium is the enemy. There's a really interesting study bullshit like the car, like the cholesterol. Yeah, like there's so many people. Oh, you're sodium. You're gonna have a high blood pressure. You're gonna die. Yeah. All your cholesterol from your carnivore diet. You're gonna die. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8162.0s)]
*  Like, come work out with me. You'll die. Yeah, you'll die. Just one leg kick. Yeah. I mean, with the workout. Yeah, it's fun. I take people through my workout. I love taking people through it because I've done it for so long that it's so hard. But I've built my system up to be able to tolerate it. So when I bring people and even people that work out, they're like, Jesus Christ, like, this is a lot of shit. Like, yeah. Yeah. How long do you work out? 90 minutes? It's the least 90 minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Because [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8178.0s)]
*  I do what's called when I'm not doing endurance training, I do the strong first protocol. So Pavel Tatselin, he developed this kettlebell protocol where so a lot of people like to work to failure. I don't work to failure ever. But I do the same amount of reps. So like, say if I have a 70 pound kettlebell, right, and I'm doing cleans and presses, if I can do, I could probably do 20 reps to failure. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8208.0s)]
*  So by 70 pounds, you're pulling it just to your chin or you're talking about one arm. One arm. One arm. One arm kettlebell swing. Press. Yeah. Down, clean press. Like if I go to failure, I don't know, I probably could do like 20 reps with 70 pounds. But I don't do 20 reps. I do 10. And then I put it down and then I wait like several minutes and then I'll do my left side and then I wait several minutes more and then I'll do my right side again. So I am completely rested by the time I do my second set. So I'm getting those 20 reps in but I'm doing [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8236.0s)]
*  it in two sets rather than in one set. And so I'll just do multiple sets to get the same amount of work in. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8266.0s)]
*  I think I heard him describing this to you. It's it's the amount of work. Yes. Right. So he's outworked you. Yes. Because he's done more. But you have to have time and you will feel like a lazy bitch because you're doing your set. But then your heart rates completely drop down before you do it again. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8274.56s)]
*  Really? Yeah. I take a long time. I watch TV. I'll get on my phone. I fuck off. I sit down and you feel like a lazy bitch. But I'm doing it over two plus hours. So when it's all over, I'm getting a lot of reps, but I'm not getting the same breakdown of form. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8294.68s)]
*  So the way he says it is he says that strength is a skill and that you shouldn't be doing skills when you're exhausted. He doesn't believe in like CrossFit and like all these workouts where you're going to extreme repetitions where you're breaking down your body's right. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8312.12s)]
*  Right. You would get injured that way. Yeah, yeah, they do. And some people don't. You know, but these are elite athletes and you build yourself up to it. And I understand I'm not against. Have you noticed that you've got I'm not either. Have you noticed that you've gotten a lot stronger? Oh, yeah. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8330.04s)]
*  Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. By doing it this way. Well, this is the thing like I don't bench press. But one time we were doing this, this podcast and we were drinking and we're drunk and we all like went to see I don't even we were drunk. I don't bench press, but I bench press to 2513 times and I don't do it. I don't know. I was like, let's see. And I was like, yep, but that's no bench pressing. I don't bench press. What do you do for your chest? I do push ups. I do 100 push ups a day and I do dips. That's it. Yeah, dips are dips. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8343.84s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't like have a big chest. So what else do you supplement with? So you take like creatine every day. Creatine is amazing. Every day. I think, you know, especially for women, by the way, I think if you're a female and you're 40 years or older, you need to be taken. I think it's great for your mind to. It's great for cognitive function, cognitive function and also cognitive function. If you're sleep impaired, it's one of the few things that's shown that can completely diminish the effects of sleep deprivation. You should most certainly make up for that sleep. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8373.84s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying you don't need sleep. Just take creatine. You definitely need sleep. We were talking about this the other day. I think it's one of the most important things that people neglect. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8403.84s)]
*  I think so, too. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8412.960000000001s)]
*  So I take creatine every day. I take all the supplements that you recommended to me. TMG, methylfolate. I take lots of vitamin D, K2, all that jazz. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8413.8s)]
*  Do you take that 10x Optimized? Do you take the multivitamin or do you take them separately? [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8427.0s)]
*  I take everything separately. I take I use pure encapsulations, vitamin packs. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8431.0s)]
*  Yeah. So they have a pack that has like, basically all your shit. And then on top of that, I pile on. You know, one other thing that I've started taking that I've been taking actually for a while that I was having a decrease in my eyesight and it was pretty noticeable as, you know, age related macular degeneration. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8436.0s)]
*  So I started taking macular support by pure encapsulations. That seems to have had an effect. But really what's had an effect is the red lightbed. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8453.04s)]
*  I know. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8460.24s)]
*  Red lightbed has had a big effect. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8460.64s)]
*  I told people like you texted me, you're like, bro, my eyesight is totally improved. Mine, too. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8462.24s)]
*  Stop deteriorating and start and improved slightly. Yeah, it's definitely where the point where I can look at my phone. I don't need glasses because I was using reading glasses all the time when I was looking at my phone. And now I don't need them at all anymore. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8466.48s)]
*  Yeah, I would I would definitely. Red light therapy, I would add on what I gave you the other day, those perfect aminos, which is just essentially the nine essential amino acids. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8477.119999999999s)]
*  You know, we talk about how most people are trying to dose protein so they can get to the amino acid equivalent or they're taking imperfect proteins like or incomplete proteins like collagen, which which can't build, which is a great protein, but it won't build muscle. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8490.32s)]
*  Because then. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8503.44s)]
*  But this is an important point, too. You were talking about the collagen does not build collagen. And this is. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8504.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that the idea that we can target direct proteins is is is a fallacy. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8508.92s)]
*  I you know, I use the analogy that we don't need our nails to grow our nails and we don't eat our hair to grow our hair. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8513.679999999998s)]
*  But we think that we can eat collagen to grow collagen. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8519.439999999999s)]
*  And that's actually not true. I'm not anti collagen. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8522.039999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying if you eat collagen or collagen in your coffee, it doesn't show up as collagen in your skin. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8524.359999999999s)]
*  My preference would be you take something that is a has all of the nine essential amino acids. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8529.32s)]
*  I take one called Perfect Aminos, but there's other products out there that are all nine essential amino acids. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8536.92s)]
*  You take can I pour that into the water with the hydrogen with the electrolytes in it? [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8542.36s)]
*  Hundred percent. It's not going to have any diminished. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8549.92s)]
*  I think the best morning cocktail is to take a mineral salt like a Baja Gold salt or a [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8552.12s)]
*  Celtic salt. Add that to your drinking water. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8558.880000000001s)]
*  Drop a hydrogen tablet in there. Take a scoop of Perfect Aminos. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8562.6s)]
*  Put that in there. Hydrate, mineralize and get the amino acids. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8566.12s)]
*  Can I ask you another question about creatine? [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8570.480000000001s)]
*  Is there any decreased benefit in taking creatine gummies versus creatine powder? [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8572.2s)]
*  You know, I don't I haven't looked at the at the at the bioavailability. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8577.92s)]
*  I mean, there's there's two types of creatine, which, you know, monohydrate and HCL. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8581.320000000002s)]
*  Monohydrate is where all of the research is. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8585.6s)]
*  There's a lot more research on creatine monohydrate, but creatine also comes in the HCL, the hydrochloride form. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8587.720000000001s)]
*  And I tell people that if they if they take creatine monohydrate and they and they have bloating, which some women do, they'll have a little water retention or some bloating, then just take the creatine HCL. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8594.76s)]
*  What about HMG with creatine? [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8604.92s)]
*  No issues of that at all. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8607.800000000001s)]
*  Is that a good thing? Because I know that a lot of companies, they combined creatine and HMG for some reason. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8609.12s)]
*  Yes. What is the benefit of that? Combine the two of them together? [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8614.12s)]
*  So it's myofibril uptake or cellular uptake. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8617.2s)]
*  Right. So bioavailability is a lot of these a lot of things that we we pair together for bioavailability, like D3 with K2. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8620.560000000001s)]
*  Right. And magnesium as well, right? [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8628.36s)]
*  Yeah. And magnesium is one of the critical divisions. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8630.080000000002s)]
*  I always take that with D3 and K2. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8632.36s)]
*  That's good. You take magnesium with D3 and K2. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8634.52s)]
*  That's perfect. That's a way that wouldn't you know, [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8636.96s)]
*  Can you take too much magnesium? [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8639.0s)]
*  You can take too much magnesium. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8641.48s)]
*  It's a little hard. I mean, it's a really essential light metal. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8643.0s)]
*  I mean, you have to really over supplement with that. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8645.439999999999s)]
*  I take a nighttime. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8647.839999999998s)]
*  I take this thing called by biooptimizer is called magnesium breakthrough, which has seven forms of magnesium in it. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8649.4s)]
*  I'm a big fan of that. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8657.4s)]
*  You can also isolate the magnesiums if you have trouble sleeping. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8658.56s)]
*  Magnesium 3 and 8 is really good. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8661.56s)]
*  Magnesium citrate and glycinate are good for intestinal motility. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8664.279999999999s)]
*  So if you're not somebody that has a regular bowel movements, magnesium deficiency is highly linked to poor intestinal motility. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8667.76s)]
*  So if you're not somebody that wakes up within 45 minutes of the day and has a bowel movement, [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8674.88s)]
*  you may want to look to magnesium supplementation the night prior and see if that fixes your your bowel movement. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8681.08s)]
*  Also, you know, people that have that ruminate at night who, you know, they lay down to go to sleep in their body tire, but their mind awake. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8687.400000000001s)]
*  This is generally a rise in something called catecholamines. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8695.28s)]
*  These these neurotransmitters in the brain that create a waking state. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8698.52s)]
*  They're also the same neurotransmitters that create anxiety and trigger our fight or flight response. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8702.2s)]
*  A lot of times magnesium, methyl folate and a simple B complex will quiet those those squirrels. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8707.76s)]
*  Very, very simple methylated nutrients to actually break down those catecholamines. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8716.4s)]
*  Because, you know, I talk about this all the time. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8723.92s)]
*  A lot of people that suffer from anxiety are never really told what it is. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8725.599999999999s)]
*  Like nobody sits them down and tells them what is anxiety? [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8731.16s)]
*  Like, why do I feel why do sometimes I feel like I'm in a heightened state of awareness? [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8733.8s)]
*  And then I move from a heightened state of awareness to being anxious. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8740.16s)]
*  And then I move from being anxious to full blown anxiety, like I actually feel the presence of a fear. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8743.56s)]
*  And then, you know, sometimes that presence of a fear goes into like a rapid heart rate or acute hearing or [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8749.0s)]
*  pupils dilate. And then that goes into a full blown panic attack. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8757.32s)]
*  And if catecholamines continue to rise, you can even have a full blown paranoia. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8760.0s)]
*  It's it's this rise in this category of neurotransmitters called catecholamines. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8764.039999999999s)]
*  So if we identified anxiety as that, and I'm not saying it's always that, but the majority of people have that form where [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8769.0s)]
*  they have metabolism issues because of a gene mutation called CompT. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8777.919999999998s)]
*  And they are warriors, not warriors. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8782.199999999999s)]
*  So they lay down to go to sleep at night, their mind wakes up, they start ruminating thoughts at night. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8786.08s)]
*  If they think about anything at night, they'll take it straight to worst case scenario. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8791.839999999998s)]
*  So every scenario that they that they ruminate on at night, they take it to worst case scenario. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8795.400000000001s)]
*  That's crazy that that could be nutritionally related. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8800.68s)]
*  It's absolutely nutritionally related, because when you when you talk about what a catecholamines do in the body, there are fight or flight response. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8804.12s)]
*  So if you walked out of this door right here and somebody was standing in front of you with a knife right in that hallway, your [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8811.720000000001s)]
*  side's kicking their ass. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8818.24s)]
*  Your pupils would dilate, your heart rate would increase, your extremities would flood with blood, your hearing would get acute. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8819.44s)]
*  You would instantly start having a fight or flight response. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8824.400000000001s)]
*  Well, what happened? Right. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8826.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, that person didn't do anything to you yet. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8828.800000000001s)]
*  What happened inside of your body that caused that response? [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8830.640000000001s)]
*  You received a dump of catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine, fedroin and dopamine, one of those we call adrenaline. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8834.28s)]
*  So so you're in this hyper acute state. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8843.880000000001s)]
*  So that's that's like we dump those to an eight full blown fight or flight response. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8846.68s)]
*  Well, what happens if we dump them to a three? [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8852.48s)]
*  Well, if that happens at night, your body tired, but your mind awake. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8855.72s)]
*  And so you lay there just ruminating because your mind is in awakened state, even though your body is tired. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8859.72s)]
*  And so if you look at the pathways that actually break down catecholamines, how do we down regulate catecholamines? [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8865.039999999999s)]
*  Complex of B vitamins, a form of a form of B12 called methyl cobalamin, which you can get anywhere, guys. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8871.08s)]
*  A something called methyl folate. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8880.32s)]
*  And every once in a while, Sammy has the dentist's old methionine. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8884.48s)]
*  It is astounding what you can do to human beings by putting those raw materials back. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8888.76s)]
*  Has anybody ever done a study on people with paranoid schizophrenia to find out if they're lacking in all this? [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8893.0s)]
*  No, no doubt. Paranoid schizophrenia are the next level. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8899.16s)]
*  You know, what's what's really interesting is I interviewed a Harvard physician on my podcast, and he was treating drug-related problems. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8901.84s)]
*  He was treating drug-resistant mental illness with diet, mainly keto diets. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8909.36s)]
*  And he found that the beta hydroxybutyrate, which is the ketone body, the main ketone body in this, and in basic supplementation, fixing their methylation pathways, meaning supplementing for for methylation, poor conversion of certain chemicals, [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8915.720000000001s)]
*  led to more better behavioral changes than they were having in the drug resistant mental illness group. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8934.679999999998s)]
*  And it's it's really fascinating because we don't like to think that nutrient deficiencies could lead to serious mental illness. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8943.24s)]
*  Could you just Google a methylation chart? [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8952.679999999998s)]
*  Can I just show you a chart of methylation? [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8957.76s)]
*  The reason why I want to put it up here is because and just click on any one of them once you once you put it up there, it's going to look like this complicated myriad. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8959.76s)]
*  Just click on that one. So this is something I've committed to memory. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8968.44s)]
*  But the reason why I show a lot of people this chart is for what's not on here. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8972.04s)]
*  So this is what we call methylation. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8978.36s)]
*  OK, this is this is the process that's going on 300 billion times a day inside of all of your cells. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8980.6s)]
*  And you'll see tryptophan and tyrosine and phenylalanine and quinone gas and lactic acid cholesterol. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8987.48s)]
*  You see all of this stuff on this chart. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8992.64s)]
*  The reason why I show people this chart is because this is going on 300 billion times a day inside of your body every minute, every hour of every day. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=8995.4s)]
*  What you do not see on this chart is a single synthetic, a single chemical or a single pharmaceutical. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9005.08s)]
*  So why is it that we think synthetics, pharmaceuticals and chemicals could be the answer to deficiencies in this chart? [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9012.6s)]
*  They're not. So what happens if I just start wandering around this chart and I find something like serotonin, I go, wow, let me just let me just. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9021.84s)]
*  Serotonin is the main driver of mood. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9033.52s)]
*  I wonder how serotonin is made. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9036.0s)]
*  Oh, I actually in fact, there's serotonin right there. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9038.56s)]
*  What is it made from? Just follow that arrow up. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9041.6s)]
*  Oh, it's made from tryptophan. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9044.28s)]
*  And what do I need in order to convert tryptophan to serotonin? [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9046.560000000001s)]
*  I need 5-HTP. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9050.52s)]
*  I need thiamine. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9052.720000000001s)]
*  I need a complex of B vitamins. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9054.08s)]
*  Could it be possible that a complex of B vitamins is stopping me from converting tryptophan into serotonin? [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9056.52s)]
*  Yes. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9062.36s)]
*  And what happens if I can't convert tryptophan into serotonin? [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9063.12s)]
*  Serotonin drops. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9065.800000000001s)]
*  And if serotonin drops, I cannot assemble moods that require serotonin. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9067.08s)]
*  So now I've been told I have a mood disorder and I have a nutrient deficiency. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9071.199999999999s)]
*  Look at this anxiety, ADD, ADHD. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9075.48s)]
*  See that on there? [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9078.16s)]
*  OK. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9079.919999999998s)]
*  Well, what do we make dopamine from? [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9081.0s)]
*  Phenylalanine and tyrosine. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9083.359999999999s)]
*  What if I had a deficiency in phenylalanine or tyrosine? [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9085.48s)]
*  Oh, I couldn't make it a neurotransmitter dopamine. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9088.16s)]
*  What is dopamine? [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9090.359999999999s)]
*  Dopamine is the main driver of behavior. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9091.519999999999s)]
*  Well, what happens if dopamine is low? [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9094.16s)]
*  Now I have an addiction. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9096.16s)]
*  Why? [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9097.72s)]
*  Because the absence of dopamine is the presence of addiction. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9098.12s)]
*  So could I have addictive behavior because I'm low in dopamine and not actually just addicted to nicotine, alcohol, drugs, [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9102.08s)]
*  promiscuity, gambling? [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9108.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9110.039999999999s)]
*  And why is it that most most addictions have a tendency to shift and never really go away? [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9111.12s)]
*  If you've ever really been an addict or ever known a true addict, why is it that their addiction has a tendency to shift and not go away? [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9116.44s)]
*  Yeah, like some of them find a healthy thing to get addicted to, like running. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9124.12s)]
*  Yeah, there'll be a so alcoholics become workaholics, workaholics become work-out-aholics. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9127.28s)]
*  When I used to compete amateur in long distance triathlons, most of the guys that I raced with were recovering addicts of some kind. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9133.2s)]
*  Some of the scariest guys I've ever trained with were former drug addicts. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9144.04s)]
*  Because this is their new... [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9148.0s)]
*  They're fucking driven, like in a weird kind of crazy way. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9149.52s)]
*  Why are they driven so hard? [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9153.960000000001s)]
*  Well, some of them actually almost died. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9155.160000000002s)]
*  And they realized... [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9157.2s)]
*  But, you know... [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9158.52s)]
*  They've been to death's door and come back. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9159.28s)]
*  The absence of dopamine is the presence of addiction. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9161.6s)]
*  And we never treat the dopamine deficiency, we only treat the physical addiction. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9165.44s)]
*  So we get you off alcohol and now you're on, you know, Suboxone, you get off Suboxone and now you're gambling, you're off gambling and smoking cigarettes. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9169.560000000001s)]
*  You've done smoking cigarettes, you know... [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9176.44s)]
*  So a lot of alcoholics, anonymous people are smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee constantly. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9178.400000000001s)]
*  Now, why is that? [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9182.6s)]
*  Because they're chasing the dopamine deficiency. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9183.64s)]
*  Rarely, if ever, did a true addict wake up one day and just say, I want to get really banged up. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9185.76s)]
*  The majority of addicts woke up one day and said, I want to feel normal. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9194.08s)]
*  And it was the search for normalcy that developed the addiction. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9198.279999999999s)]
*  They smoked a cigarette, they felt normal. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9203.039999999999s)]
*  They took a drink and they could socialize. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9204.56s)]
*  They were promiscuous and they kind of felt normal. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9207.119999999999s)]
*  They jumped off a fucking mountain in a squirrel suit and the rush dopamine actually brought their dopamine level to normal. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9209.0s)]
*  They actually felt calm 15 inches away from death. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9215.32s)]
*  And so the deficiency in dopamine very often drives this. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9220.279999999999s)]
*  And we label these people with mental illnesses. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9223.88s)]
*  We label them with mood disorders. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9227.439999999999s)]
*  But serotonin is a part of the recipe of mood. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9230.96s)]
*  So if you said to me, what is a mood? [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9236.08s)]
*  What is an emotional state? [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9237.56s)]
*  I would say it's a collection of neurotransmitters bound to oxygen. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9239.16s)]
*  So let's say that you said, OK, what's happiness? [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9243.16s)]
*  OK, there's so much serotonin, so much dopamine, so much norepinephrine, so much norepinephrine. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9246.839999999998s)]
*  Boom, you put these together, you have the emotion of happiness. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9250.359999999999s)]
*  Well, what if I just took serotonin out? [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9253.24s)]
*  Right. Like, what if I went to a bakery chef and said, hey, chef, you can bake whatever you want. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9257.039999999999s)]
*  You just can't use butter. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9261.039999999999s)]
*  And so I took butter out and it didn't sound like a big deal. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9263.08s)]
*  It's only one one component. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9266.16s)]
*  But think of how many recipes that would affect cookies, pastries, pies, brownies. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9268.24s)]
*  Well, the moods are no different. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9272.84s)]
*  I say, Joe, you can be in whatever mood you want. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9275.24s)]
*  You just can't use serotonin. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9277.88s)]
*  So now any mood that you go to assemble that requires serotonin, you can't manufacture. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9280.0s)]
*  So now you have a mood disorder instead of taking a step back and saying, well, [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9287.36s)]
*  why doesn't he have serotonin? [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9292.08s)]
*  Where's serotonin made? Well, serotonin is made in the gut. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9293.64s)]
*  90 percent of it's right here. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9295.72s)]
*  So if you don't have it here, you can't have it here. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9297.2s)]
*  And and so then why don't we go to the factory in the gut to make serotonin? [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9299.800000000001s)]
*  Where is the factory that turns tryptophan into the neurotransmitter serotonin? [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9305.28s)]
*  Well, it's in it's in the gut. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9310.16s)]
*  What has that done through a process called methylation? [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9311.480000000001s)]
*  You mean if I'm deficient in certain vitamins or nutrients, [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9315.16s)]
*  that methylation cycle is not working. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9320.36s)]
*  Am I not produce serotonin and therefore I might have a mood disorder? [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9322.08s)]
*  Yes. Am I saying that all mood disorders come from that? [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9324.6s)]
*  No. But there are so many things that come from this methylation [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9327.08s)]
*  cycle that are so potentially easy to fix with basic supplementation. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9331.6s)]
*  You know, for two years, [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9338.24s)]
*  for two years in our initial clinic, my wife and I and our doctor, [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9341.84s)]
*  we we pulled blood work. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9346.24s)]
*  I think it was about a 1600 patients or so that came through our clinic. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9347.92s)]
*  We pulled blood work and we pulled these basic biomarkers, CBC, ACMP, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9351.8s)]
*  lipid panel, hormone panel and nutrient deficiencies. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9355.68s)]
*  And then we also pulled this methylation test, right? [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9359.68s)]
*  Looking at five genes of methylation and and [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9362.6s)]
*  and you can get these methylation tests done anywhere. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9366.84s)]
*  And we looked at these five genes. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9369.08s)]
*  And then what we would do is we would solve [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9370.28s)]
*  with supplementation for the genetic deficiency [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9373.0s)]
*  and watch what happened to the blood biomarkers. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9376.2s)]
*  You would see kidney filtration rates improve. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9380.0s)]
*  You would see waste elimination, like people become more regular. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9382.88s)]
*  You would see C reactive protein. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9386.32s)]
*  These these nonspecific markers of inflammation drop. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9388.88s)]
*  You would certainly see things like homocysteine drop. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9391.24s)]
*  People have that very, very high levels of homocysteine. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9394.279999999999s)]
*  You supplement them with the right [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9396.76s)]
*  nutrients, a B complex, something called trimethylglycine. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9399.32s)]
*  And they start to break down homocysteine. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9402.16s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, they're reporting that their blood pressure [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9403.88s)]
*  is returning to normal and have less frequent headaches. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9406.16s)]
*  It is astounding to me how many people are just nutrient efficient [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9409.76s)]
*  and don't accept that basic supplementation or we can get everything from diet. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9414.08s)]
*  Bullshit. If you look at a soil lineage study from 1945 [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9418.8s)]
*  and a soil lineage study right now, you would be astounded [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9422.44s)]
*  to see how depleted our food supply is or our soil is. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9425.359999999999s)]
*  Add processed food and all this other stuff to it. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9428.72s)]
*  You don't stand a chance. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9430.68s)]
*  You need you need basic supplementation. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9432.279999999999s)]
*  All human beings need the same things. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9435.68s)]
*  We need two essential fatty acids. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9438.0s)]
*  Essential means they're essential for life. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9440.0s)]
*  You need nine essential amino acids. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9442.84s)]
*  So you can supplement with the nine essential amino acids in the morning. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9445.8s)]
*  You can supplement with the two essential fatty acids, omega [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9449.0s)]
*  three fatty acids like black seed oil or good mega fish oil. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9451.519999999999s)]
*  You can supplement with the minerals. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9456.08s)]
*  So many of us are mineral deficient [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9459.0s)]
*  and we don't realize the expression of mineral deficiency. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9462.279999999999s)]
*  Now, what is the best kind of minerals to take? [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9467.16s)]
*  Is it like chelated minerals? [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9469.28s)]
*  Is it I take one called Baja Gold Sea Salt? [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9471.08s)]
*  It's probably one of my other favorite biohacks because of a bag of Baja Gold [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9474.640000000001s)]
*  sea salt like a Celtic salt will have all these trace minerals in it. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9478.880000000001s)]
*  A $15 bag will last you five years. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9483.76s)]
*  It's dirt cheap. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9486.08s)]
*  And you can take a quarter to a half teaspoon of this. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9488.560000000001s)]
*  Put it in and you're drinking water. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9491.08s)]
*  I'll put throw a hydrogen tablet in there and some amino acids. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9493.4s)]
*  Take that with a methylated multivitamin and take that with [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9496.92s)]
*  an omega three fatty acid. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9501.199999999999s)]
*  And you have all the bases covered first thing in the morning. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9502.76s)]
*  And if you don't have to take that with the vitamins with food, [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9505.72s)]
*  I would take the vitamin D3 with food. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9509.48s)]
*  I would actually take all of that when I would take the the amino acids [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9511.279999999999s)]
*  and the the hydrogen and the and the sea salt on an empty stomach is fine. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9515.199999999999s)]
*  Whenever you're going to take your multivitamin and and your D3, [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9521.0s)]
*  which is fat soluble, I would take those with food. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9524.16s)]
*  So first thing in the morning, you just hydrated and mineralized the body [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9527.52s)]
*  just with a basic sea salt, just hydrate and there's a lot of good mineral. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9533.72s)]
*  And the amino acids you take on an empty stomach. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9538.88s)]
*  Amino acids you take on an empty stomach and those amino acids, [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9541.68s)]
*  those perfect amino acids won't won't break a fast. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9545.76s)]
*  They have their non caloric or they have, I think, one calorie, [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9548.640000000001s)]
*  but they won't break a fast. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9551.6s)]
*  And now you have all nine of the essential amino acids. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9553.480000000001s)]
*  You've got the majority of of the essential minerals. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9555.6s)]
*  You've hydrated yourself and you put hydrogen gas into your to your blood. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9558.240000000002s)]
*  You will feel the difference. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9562.560000000001s)]
*  Right. You just feel. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9564.400000000001s)]
*  And it's a simple thing to do. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9566.04s)]
*  And it's such a simple thing to do. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9567.2s)]
*  And I get so much flack for telling people to do them like this. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9570.160000000002s)]
*  Just this is just getting us back to the basic. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9572.44s)]
*  I do. It's crazy. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9575.400000000001s)]
*  It's just just people drive me crazy. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9576.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to start shutting it all off. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9578.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you have to. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9580.24s)]
*  It's it may it'll make your life a lot better. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9581.439999999999s)]
*  You know what you're doing. Yeah. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9583.24s)]
*  Yeah. And people are listening. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9584.48s)]
*  It's working. Yeah. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9586.56s)]
*  There's just too many people out there that is crying for attention. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9588.24s)]
*  And one of the ways they get attention is by attacking people [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9591.56s)]
*  who are getting positive attention. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9594.48s)]
*  It's a shame. Fuck those people. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9597.8s)]
*  Fuck those people. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9600.679999999998s)]
*  Anything else we should talk about before we wrap this up? [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9602.039999999999s)]
*  I think we covered a lot. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9604.119999999999s)]
*  People are going to have to review this and go back and forth. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9605.6s)]
*  I love coming out here and chopping it up with you, man. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9608.24s)]
*  I love having you on. I'll see you at the fights tomorrow too. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9610.76s)]
*  Yes, sir. I'm excited. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9612.4s)]
*  Yeah. Tomorrow's the weigh ins and then Saturday night's the fights. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9613.68s)]
*  I'm pumped. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9616.4s)]
*  By the way, dude, Joe Rogan on the Ultimate Human podcast, a rare sighting. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9617.36s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9622.08s)]
*  That was cool because we went down. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9623.12s)]
*  We went down some rabbit holes, man. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9624.56s)]
*  We went down the pyramids. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9626.0s)]
*  Yeah, we talked about a lot of cool shit. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhC8lLPpGl4&t=9628.52s)]
