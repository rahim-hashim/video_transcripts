# Joe Rogan Experience #2295 - Scott Payne
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=0.0s)]
*  You had a crazy fucking life, man. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6.4s)]
*  Like a really crazy life. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=14.76s)]
*  So to get everybody up to speed right from the beginning, you spent 25 years undercover, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=17.12s)]
*  working for the FBI in the Klan, Nazi organizations, and biker gangs. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=23.68s)]
*  And then some, yes sir. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=29.98s)]
*  What a crazy, crazy life that is. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=31.3s)]
*  First of all, how did you first get started doing that? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=36.06s)]
*  Good question. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=40.86s)]
*  I grew up in South Carolina, played ball, all that stuff. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=41.86s)]
*  I was always kind of a, I mean if you look back, not trying to be cocky, whatever, because [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=46.78s)]
*  that's not it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=51.94s)]
*  You've had plenty of people on this show that are complete badasses. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=52.94s)]
*  But I was kind of a bully of bullies. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=56.46s)]
*  I always looked out, I liked the underdog. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=58.58s)]
*  I bounced in college, so I was already learning that gift of gab and fight techniques and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=61.98s)]
*  stuff like that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=68.62s)]
*  And then I became a cop, because when I was in college, I took a course, I'm taking electives. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=69.62s)]
*  I went to college so I'd have four more years to figure out what I was going to do. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=75.14s)]
*  Because I didn't know what I was doing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=77.78s)]
*  Me too. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=79.62s)]
*  Except partying. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=80.62s)]
*  I did three years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=81.62s)]
*  I was good at partying. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=82.62s)]
*  I hit an elective that was criminal justice, and man I really liked it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=87.94s)]
*  Psychology was always a strong thing for me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=92.06s)]
*  But it took a back seat and I ended up coming out with a major in criminal justice and a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=94.7s)]
*  minor in psychology. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=99.18s)]
*  But during those criminal justice courses, I was like, at first, for a fleeting moment, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=100.54s)]
*  I said, I'm going to be an attorney. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=106.06s)]
*  Yeah, I'll be an attorney. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=107.38000000000001s)]
*  And then I realized I'd be a terrible attorney. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=108.9s)]
*  I said, because if I was the defense attorney and they said they did it, I would probably [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=111.58000000000001s)]
*  just walk in and go, they did it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=115.06s)]
*  That's not going to get me any clients. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=117.5s)]
*  And if I was the prosecutor, I pictured me being like Sam Kenness and grabbing them and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=119.3s)]
*  going, say it, say it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=122.38s)]
*  You did it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=125.06s)]
*  So I'm like, yeah, that's probably not the best role for me. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=126.06s)]
*  And I did a ride along with cops at the department and that was it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=128.62s)]
*  But once I got in to law enforcement, I was uniformed patrol for three years. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=133.38s)]
*  I was just so fascinated with undercover. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=139.3s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=141.7s)]
*  I can't really remember doing the book. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=142.98s)]
*  I've tried to dive back in. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=145.26000000000002s)]
*  People ask. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=146.5s)]
*  I don't really remember. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=147.5s)]
*  I just know that I loved undercover movies, period. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  If it was a biker underco... [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=152.3s)]
*  I don't care how cheesy it was. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=153.70000000000002s)]
*  I love them all. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=154.94s)]
*  And then one of my mentors at the sheriff's office, he was actually the world's strongest [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  man in the late 80s after Casmeyer. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  He was a former Marine and big dude. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=163.46s)]
*  And he, as a task force, had gone on a task force, had gone undercover in some biker gangs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=168.26000000000002s)]
*  And man, I wanted to be a biker. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=174.7s)]
*  I grew up on motorcycles and then just started taking off from there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=177.22s)]
*  You got to think that biker gangs are probably super suspicious of people being undercover [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=180.66s)]
*  because it's such a theme. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=185.61999999999998s)]
*  You think? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=187.42s)]
*  It's been around forever, the stories of guys infiltrating biker gangs. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=188.42s)]
*  It's been around forever. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=192.62s)]
*  40 plus years right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=193.62s)]
*  Easy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=197.01999999999998s)]
*  And then there's books made. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  There's books made. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  They go to court. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=200.01999999999998s)]
*  They learn. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  So it was right after the Vietnam War, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  That's when all the biker gangs really started kicking off. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=204.9s)]
*  I think it goes back to world, I mean my history's bad, but I think it goes back to World War [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=205.9s)]
*  at least too, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  Because all those, the way it goes, everybody always asks what a one percenter is. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=214.34s)]
*  And it goes back, I think it's 1947, but it goes back to when your veterans are getting [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=218.18s)]
*  out. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=223.86s)]
*  They have nothing, they had no decompression back then. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=225.02s)]
*  They had no plans or programs for them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=228.58s)]
*  And they've been out here living this raucous, rowdy life. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=231.34s)]
*  And now they're back in the States and now they're supposed to just flip and be like... [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=234.82s)]
*  So they started creating these clubs and they were doing some raucous and rowdy stuff. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  And then it was the president of the American Motorcycle Association that came out and made [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=242.3s)]
*  this statement that said something to the effect of, listen, 99% of all motorcycle riders [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=247.58s)]
*  are good, law-abiding citizens. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=253.34s)]
*  There's only 1% that's bad. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=255.34s)]
*  And they took that as a badge of honor and said, we're one percenters. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=257.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=260.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=261.38s)]
*  Cool stuff. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=262.38s)]
*  Who was the first person to infiltrate them? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=263.7s)]
*  Do you know the history of that? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=265.46s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=266.94s)]
*  But so it's been going on forever. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=267.94s)]
*  As soon as they found out, it's like it's been the case with the mob. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=269.34s)]
*  It's been the case with everything. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=272.9s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=273.9s)]
*  Johnny Brasco. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=274.9s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=275.9s)]
*  My mentor. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=276.9s)]
*  One of my... [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=277.9s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=278.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=279.9s)]
*  Joe Pistole? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=280.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=281.9s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=282.9s)]
*  He helped certify me. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=283.9s)]
*  I saw him probably within the last six months or so. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=284.9s)]
*  Graciously, he did a blurb on the book, too. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=285.9s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=287.14s)]
*  I call him boss man. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=288.14s)]
*  So do you remember your first undercover assignment? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=289.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=292.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=293.62s)]
*  What'd you have to do? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=294.62s)]
*  It was at the sheriff's office. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=295.62s)]
*  So after three years in uniform, I make it to Narcotics Investigator. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=297.58s)]
*  Well, you got... [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=301.74s)]
*  It's a tough crowd, but we're funny. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=303.1s)]
*  You know, it's just like a good military group or anything else. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=304.82s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of ribbon and stuff like that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=308.42s)]
*  So they said, hey, you're going to go buy some dope tonight. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=310.9s)]
*  It's my first time. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=315.54s)]
*  Now, granted, I bought weed and stuff in high school when I was around those groups, but [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=316.54s)]
*  I never bought crack cocaine. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=319.66s)]
*  I was already probably 6'4". [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=321.58000000000004s)]
*  I probably was about 270 pounds. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=323.14000000000004s)]
*  I did not look like I smoked crack unless I just fell off the wagon. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  Just real recent. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=331.18s)]
*  Or I just started, yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=332.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=333.18s)]
*  I'm the vegan that shows up still smelling like beef. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=334.18s)]
*  I just stopped. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=336.82000000000005s)]
*  But they told me, hey, it's real easy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=339.38s)]

*  It's a known drug trafficking area. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=342.38s)]
*  You're going to roll down there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=345.02000000000004s)]
*  White boy, you're going to roll down the window. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=346.66s)]
*  They're going to come up to you and say, what do you want? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  And back then, it was a 20. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  You get a rock, 20 bucks for a rock. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=351.02s)]
*  All you got to do is hold that 20 and say, you just want a 20. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=352.73999999999995s)]
*  Joe, I drove down there. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=355.61999999999995s)]
*  I know I was scared because I was out of my comfort zone, but I was also scared to make [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=357.7s)]
*  a fool of myself in front of the narcotics guys and gals that were training me. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=363.58s)]
*  And I rolled down the street and I pull up and they come running up to the window, what [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=369.26s)]
*  you want? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=371.97999999999996s)]
*  What you want? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=372.97999999999996s)]
*  I cracked the window. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  I crack it about this far and I stick a 20 like I'm trying to go to a vending machine. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=374.97999999999996s)]
*  I want a 20. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=381.14s)]
*  You know? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=382.14s)]
*  And the dude's like, he takes the 20, but he can't hand me the crack rock back to the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=383.14s)]
*  cracked window. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=387.18s)]
*  He's like, roll the damn window down. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=388.18s)]
*  And I'm like, my bad. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=389.38s)]
*  It's probably like a sliver of soap. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=391.29999999999995s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=392.7s)]
*  But that was my first drug buy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=393.7s)]
*  First undercover, like legit. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=396.06s)]
*  And so what was the protocol? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=398.34s)]
*  Like you had to buy the drug and then what do you do? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=399.9s)]
*  It depends. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  Case by case basis, we may want to make numerous buys on that corner, try to come in with the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=404.34s)]
*  jump out boys, they used to call them and shut that corner down for a while. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  We may be trying to make buys on the low level people on the corner selling who are probably [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=412.02000000000004s)]
*  most likely users, at least in my experience. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=417.26s)]
*  So maybe like every five crack rocks they sold, they can peel one for themselves. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=420.06s)]
*  And maybe we want to get them, build a case on them, kind of try to climb it up. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=425.54s)]
*  And then find out who's the distributor. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=430.90000000000003s)]

*  I don't like them. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=551.4s)]
*  I can go buy it for you. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=552.4s)]
*  A lot of times we're paying a source or they could be working off a charge. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=553.4s)]
*  It could be part of their plea agreement. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=560.32s)]
*  So this is your first one. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=561.88s)]

*  And then how often are you doing this? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=564.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=566.4s)]
*  I mean, we could come in. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=567.4s)]
*  Let's just say there's six investigators on northern or southern command narcotics in [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  Greenville County. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=573.96s)]
*  You might be one of my partners and we come in and you go, hey, I got a source. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=575.92s)]
*  If he's going to go make a buy tonight, you might hop in the car with him. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=579.04s)]
*  It just happens. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=581.36s)]
*  It gives me it's almost a daily thing. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=582.36s)]
*  And so you develop your skills doing this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=585.56s)]
*  You get real good at being undercover. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=588.0s)]
*  And then how do you move on to the big boys? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=590.1999999999999s)]
*  How do you move on to biker gangs, Nazis? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=592.7199999999999s)]
*  I got hired by the FBI. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=595.04s)]
*  And was it specifically because you were good at undercover shit? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=597.04s)]
*  No, you see a picture of me. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=601.64s)]
*  This is me. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=603.9599999999999s)]
*  For the Academy, I mean, it's a cheesy, thin, fuzzy mustache. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=605.56s)]
*  Can't go past the crease of your lip, high and tight. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  You're going to get your haircut at the PX in Quantico. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=613.56s)]
*  It was usually foreign ladies that were cutting your hair. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  No matter how I'd explained what I wanted, I got the same haircut every time. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=619.7199999999999s)]
*  You take it up a little bit here and not so much here. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=624.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=626.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=627.12s)]
*  You know, like, all right, there you go. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=628.12s)]
*  I guess this is what we're doing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=629.12s)]
*  One thing I noticed at the state level was we would all go back then, the South Carolina [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  Criminal Justice Academy is in Columbia, South Carolina. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=636.4s)]
*  So we would go there and get certified. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=639.64s)]
*  But in your county, I mean, how many ways can I shape? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm in the same county and you're going out here making buys. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=646.44s)]
*  How many times can I change my car, change my outfit, change my facial hair, the hair [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  on my head until everybody starts knowing I'm a narc? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=654.16s)]
*  You know, because when you're in that local environment, and I mean, I'm talking Greenville, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=658.24s)]
*  South Carolina, Miami might be a little bit different or New York City, but you're going [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=662.6s)]
*  to court a lot and people are seeing you in court. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=666.6s)]
*  And then so how do you roll out there? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=669.6s)]
*  So a lot of it turns into just running sources. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=671.2800000000001s)]
*  To me, I believe developing and running sources is hand in hand with undercover because other [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=675.4000000000001s)]
*  than them not being a bonded law enforcement officer. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=681.5s)]
*  I don't have a felon on my record, but they do. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=686.2s)]
*  They're still the ones we're wiring up and going in to get the evidence. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  So a lot of it over the last many years with the defund the police and the black guy is [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  hard to recruit. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=700.1600000000001s)]
*  It's hard enough to get people to fill the uniform slots. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=701.48s)]
*  So you really don't have anybody doing undercover. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  Most of it, most of your smaller departments that I've taught or talked to or learned [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=708.4000000000001s)]
*  from is they're just running sources. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=713.12s)]
*  Really, so this all stopped during defund of the police? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=715.88s)]
*  Or like the George Floyd times? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=718.44s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=719.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's the pendulum swings, right? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=720.88s)]
*  Or it could be that because generations are different these days, people come to apply [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=723.8000000000001s)]
*  and they've got felons on their record. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=729.2s)]
*  And we're like, bro, you can't be a cop. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=730.64s)]
*  You got a felon on your record. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=733.44s)]
*  But I remember thinking, wouldn't it be kind of cool if South Carolina Criminal Justice [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=735.84s)]
*  Academy had all of the certified undercovers in some type of database where it says, hey, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=741.28s)]
*  Scott's skill set is biker, you know, riding motorcycles, can go in a biker bar or whatever, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=745.4s)]
*  strip clubs, this, that, and the other. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=751.0799999999999s)]
*  Maybe Charleston County needs somebody. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=752.52s)]
*  Wouldn't that be cool if I could just shoot down there and make buys for Charleston County, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=754.9599999999999s)]
*  but go back? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=758.68s)]
*  Then that way nobody knows me in Charleston County. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=759.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=761.28s)]
*  And when I got in the FBI, that's kind of what they do. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=762.0s)]
*  You get certified in the FBI and you can go around the world. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=764.64s)]
*  So what was your initial job in the FBI? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=768.4399999999999s)]
*  You are a case agent. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=772.0s)]
*  When you get hired, your only responsibility you have really is you're a case agent. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=773.4s)]
*  And that means you investigate, you do your own cases. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=780.6800000000001s)]
*  I did that the entire career. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=784.36s)]
*  Even when I was doing undercover, I was still a case agent. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=786.08s)]
*  But I went through the Academy. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=788.76s)]
*  I got New York City as my first office. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=791.88s)]
*  And New York is the largest office. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=794.12s)]
*  So they put you kind of like on a rotation. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=795.72s)]
*  You don't just go straight to a squad. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=797.44s)]
*  You're going to be like, they want you to learn the city. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=799.16s)]
*  They want you to learn the ins and outs of having a placard and the bus lane and all [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  that stuff. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=805.6s)]
*  Or just how to figure out how to get into the damn Lincoln Tunnel when six lanes go [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=806.52s)]
*  like that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=811.04s)]
*  But eventually I went through the rotation and I got placed on the Colombian drug squad. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=813.28s)]
*  So there, then people start learning you were a certified undercover at a state level [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=817.92s)]
*  on this side and the other. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=822.6s)]
*  So then they about be something like, say, LA takes off a 3,000. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=823.48s)]
*  We're talking like 2001, 2000, somewhere in there. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=827.64s)]
*  So they take off 3,000 pounds of weed in LA. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=831.96s)]
*  And it was supposed to come to New York. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=834.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, we go with them and say, man, can you send us all the stuff? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=837.24s)]
*  They're cutting leads to us saying, hey, they're supposed to go to this address. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=841.08s)]
*  But we got to build the exact replica box. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=844.48s)]
*  And it depends on the US attorney working the case. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  They may want assistant, United States attorney. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=850.6s)]
*  They may want to just deliver it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=852.48s)]
*  And that's good enough. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=854.84s)]
*  Some may want us to deliver it, pull away, and then they've got a hidden switch or something [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=855.68s)]
*  that notifies us when they open it just to make that case tighter. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=860.4s)]
*  So I started doing cameos on stuff like that. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=864.16s)]
*  And then I landed in undercover, which I don't really talk about in the book [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=867.28s)]
*  because it's classified. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  And we are coming up on 25 years, which is usually when they declassify them. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=872.68s)]
*  It's kind of been outed, but I just don't talk about it because I don't want to end up [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=877.52s)]
*  in the box, the lie detector, and have somebody beating me down. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=880.52s)]
*  But I landed that undercover. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=885.56s)]
*  And after about 30 days in San Antonio, they gave me another 60-day extension, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=887.68s)]
*  and I became the primary. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=893.4799999999999s)]
*  And because I was there full-time working undercover, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=895.1199999999999s)]
*  they transferred me to the San Antonio division. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=897.8399999999999s)]
*  So the first undercover gig, what was your job? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=900.16s)]
*  What were you pretending to do? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=904.88s)]
*  The classified one? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=908.16s)]
*  Again, it's classified. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=909.28s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=910.68s)]
*  I was a security guard. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=911.5999999999999s)]
*  Can you imagine being a cop with a cool uniform with a real gun on your hip? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=913.48s)]
*  And now I'm making it to the FBI, and I'm working third shift as a night [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  at the museum with a flashlight. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=922.48s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=924.1600000000001s)]
*  But I wanted to get my foot in the door of the undercover program. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  And sometimes it was easier to get a slot in the undercover school [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=928.96s)]
*  if you were already in or slated for an undercover. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=932.84s)]
*  So you eventually work your way up to probably more and more [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=938.8s)]
*  dangerous and complicated assignments? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=942.92s)]
*  What happens, at least in my experience, what happened with me is I get certified. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=946.16s)]
*  Our certification school is very, very intense. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=951.8s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what they're doing now, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=954.28s)]
*  but I'm 99.9% sure it's still very intense. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=956.04s)]
*  It's two weeks, no days off, huge on sleep deprivation. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=959.64s)]
*  I'm not going to give away all the scenarios and stuff for tradecraft reasons. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=963.6s)]
*  But let's just say that I got certified in 2002. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=967.4s)]
*  In 2003, I started role playing and assisting at the school. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=972.76s)]
*  I probably missed a handful of schools up until the day I retired. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=976.52s)]
*  Never 100% graduation rate. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=981.0s)]
*  I don't know of any 100% graduation rate before I got into the program. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=983.6s)]
*  And it's not hazing. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=989.24s)]
*  You get 20 slots. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=990.8s)]
*  So it's four groups of five. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=993.1999999999999s)]
*  And generally, it goes like you get some trainings during the day, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=995.04s)]
*  and then we're running scenarios. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=998.68s)]
*  And we're putting you into live stuff. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1000.12s)]
*  But day three and four, when you're really hurting for sleep, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1001.8s)]
*  I've seen people nut out. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1006.3199999999999s)]
*  And mine are in psych. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1008.16s)]
*  I didn't think I would see that, because some of them I might know. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1009.3199999999999s)]
*  Maybe we were on the SWAT team together. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1012.8s)]
*  Maybe I know you as a case agent, and you're squared away. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1014.4s)]
*  But you go to the UC school, and after about three days of no sleep [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1018.04s)]
*  and not getting your normal meals on your normal times, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1021.76s)]
*  not getting your workout in, one of my buddies walked in. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1024.56s)]
*  He looked like he'd been raped by a tribe. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1028.44s)]
*  He walked in, hair disheveled, buttons not lined up, zipper undone, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1030.3999999999999s)]
*  half a shirt tail. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, are you OK? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1035.76s)]
*  And some people, it's just I would say that the reason the training is [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1038.56s)]
*  like that, it's not hazing. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1045.44s)]
*  It's just so we don't lose anybody. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1047.04s)]
*  Try to make it as real as you can. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, you've got to find out who's going to crack. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1049.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and think of this. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1051.92s)]
*  In a real scenario, not all undercovers are like this. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1054.8000000000002s)]
*  But in the ones I would usually do, there's [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1058.76s)]
*  going to be a lot of times with no sleep. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1060.76s)]
*  My skill set led me not to Wall Street. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1062.6000000000001s)]
*  It didn't lead me to the yacht. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1064.92s)]
*  It didn't lead me to the mafia club unless I was standing in the corner [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1066.6000000000001s)]
*  and I was muscle for the mafia guy. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1069.44s)]
*  Mine led me to the woods and what you already mentioned, crazy, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1072.04s)]
*  crazy-ass meth heads or just ideologies. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1074.96s)]
*  So I get certified and then I go back and role play. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1078.72s)]
*  And that's when people start kind of seeing. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1083.72s)]
*  And you're trying to make a name for yourself. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1085.92s)]
*  I wasn't getting calls because on paper, I'm [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  a white guy with no foreign language. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1091.96s)]
*  But about every week or so, I would call the undercover unit [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1093.8s)]
*  and be like, hey, you got anything? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1096.3200000000002s)]
*  It's a big country. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1097.8s)]
*  You got anything more medium now? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1098.96s)]
*  But I could even be a little country at this point. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1100.4s)]
*  But I'd be like, hey, you got anything for any rednecks [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1104.16s)]
*  with no foreign language? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1106.28s)]
*  And I'd just wear them down until they'd laugh. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1107.36s)]
*  And then they finally asked me to come to school. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1109.1999999999998s)]
*  And once you do the school, now there's [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1111.24s)]
*  seasoned undercovers coming back. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1113.4799999999998s)]
*  And they're not only there to role play and to run a school, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1116.1599999999999s)]
*  they're also looking for undercovers [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1118.52s)]
*  for cases in their own divisions. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1120.56s)]
*  And that's where I kind of started getting into some things. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1122.36s)]
*  It has to be one of the most exciting kinds of law [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1125.4799999999998s)]
*  enforcement. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  For me, absolutely. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1129.84s)]
*  It has to be so crazy. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1131.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the day, military, first responder, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1133.12s)]
*  type A personality, we're adrenaline junkies. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1137.24s)]
*  Yeah, and that's got to be a gigantic rush. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1139.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1143.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1143.6200000000001s)]
*  They're onto us. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1144.1200000000001s)]
*  I've talked to a few guys that have done that kind of work. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1147.1200000000001s)]
*  And they always speak of it with sort of fond memories [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1149.5s)]
*  of how crazy it is. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1153.4s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1154.72s)]
*  It's like it's a very particular type of person [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1155.48s)]
*  that would want to put themselves [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1157.1200000000001s)]
*  in that highly stressful, adrenaline-charged situation [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1158.46s)]
*  where any mistake and they find out who you really are, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1161.76s)]
*  you're dead. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1165.0s)]
*  Could be. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1165.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1166.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1167.1999999999998s)]
*  Now you made me second guess my career. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1168.6799999999998s)]
*  Seems like it worked out. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1171.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1173.0s)]
*  I'm going to call it cash now. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1174.6s)]
*  I'll call it cash. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1176.04s)]
*  Hey, you think I could come back in? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1176.84s)]
*  What was the first one that you got, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1178.6s)]
*  the first assignment that you got where you're like, oh, boy, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1180.36s)]
*  this is big leagues? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1182.82s)]
*  That was an outlaws case. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1184.12s)]
*  I'd already done some undercovers, again, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1185.1999999999998s)]
*  in the FBI. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1187.76s)]
*  I'd done several street-level things or numerous whatever [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1188.76s)]
*  at the state level. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1192.56s)]
*  But I was doing a couple of cases in the FBI, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1194.4s)]
*  and they were smaller. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1198.3600000000001s)]
*  Maybe it was supposed to be interstate transportation [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1199.76s)]
*  of stolen goods, and it turned into a public corruption case. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1202.52s)]
*  But when I landed the outlaws case, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1205.0800000000002s)]
*  that was my first big and probably one [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1206.48s)]
*  of the biggest I did. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1210.3200000000002s)]
*  So how does that go? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1211.44s)]
*  How did that start? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1212.76s)]
*  I'm not a smart man, so that's how it started. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1214.44s)]
*  Why do you do this, Scott? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1216.8000000000002s)]
*  I go, I'm not smart. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1220.64s)]
*  I am stupid. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1222.44s)]
*  I'm a glutton for punishment. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1224.3200000000002s)]
*  And my last name is Payne. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1225.4s)]
*  In that case, they'll do canvases. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1228.28s)]
*  A lot of times, I was an undercover coordinator. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1232.3600000000001s)]
*  Every division has an undercover coordinator, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1234.28s)]
*  so you are the front line on all things covert, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1236.24s)]
*  and you're the liaison between headquarters and that field [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1239.24s)]
*  office. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1241.4s)]
*  So if I had a case come up, I may already know you [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1242.8400000000001s)]
*  or whoever and be like, hey, I'll just put a text out [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1245.68s)]
*  to you. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1248.16s)]
*  You interested? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1248.66s)]
*  Or we may just send out a canvas, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1249.64s)]
*  and then a canvas comes from headquarters [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1251.42s)]
*  and goes to every undercover coordinator. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1253.04s)]
*  And if it gets to the point to where [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1255.54s)]
*  no certified undercovers have responded, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1257.22s)]
*  then they'll do a bureau-wide canvas and see what we can get. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1259.0600000000002s)]
*  I can't remember exactly if somebody called me on that one. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1263.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1266.38s)]
*  I don't remember that outlaw as being a canvas, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1267.14s)]
*  but it possibly could have been. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1269.46s)]
*  Well, you fit the bill. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1270.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1272.66s)]
*  You look like an outlaw biker. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1273.54s)]
*  It depends. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1274.9s)]
*  A slash Viking, whatever. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1275.5s)]
*  It depends. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1278.26s)]
*  That's what a lot of people. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1279.1000000000001s)]
*  I'll get off on a tangent, but throughout my career, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1280.34s)]
*  my mentors, my peers, people I've been blessed to mentor, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1285.4199999999998s)]
*  some people come up in the office, very good friends, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1288.74s)]
*  unbelievable agents. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1290.74s)]
*  I mean, brainiacs. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1292.4599999999998s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1293.54s)]
*  They'll be like, man, I could never do what you do. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1294.02s)]
*  My beard would be down to here, whatever, tatted up. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1296.1s)]
*  And I'm like, well, don't do me. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1300.22s)]
*  What's your background? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1302.54s)]
*  And they're like, well, I was an accountant. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1303.62s)]
*  And I'm like, with who? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1305.1799999999998s)]
*  Before they had been? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1305.98s)]
*  I was an accountant with Disney or whatever. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1307.1399999999999s)]
*  I was this. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1308.82s)]
*  I was a lawyer. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1309.3s)]
*  Well, you'd be you. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1310.34s)]
*  I could. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1312.1399999999999s)]
*  Somebody's probably going to be pissed because they're [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1313.7s)]
*  going to say it's trade crap. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1315.26s)]
*  But listen, I could bring you in, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1316.34s)]
*  and you just walk into the group. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1319.98s)]
*  I'm in the primary. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1322.58s)]
*  I've already laid all this stuff out. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1323.58s)]
*  It's a chess game. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1325.18s)]
*  We're always trying to stay four or five moves ahead. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1326.06s)]
*  Or we're master of puppets. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1328.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm just trying to connect with people and work the scene. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1330.06s)]
*  But you come in, and you dress as an accountant, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1333.98s)]
*  and you talk like an accountant, and then you walk out. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1337.18s)]
*  You're you. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1339.58s)]
*  It's real. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1340.4199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1341.1s)]
*  So there's rules for all sorts of different types [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1342.6599999999999s)]
*  of personalities and life skills. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1344.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1346.34s)]
*  And I'm like, you might see something where they say, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1346.6999999999998s)]
*  I need a person this tall that speaks this language, that [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1348.74s)]
*  does this and knows this. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1351.58s)]
*  But what are you trying to do? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1352.8999999999999s)]
*  Essentially, the FBI works everything. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1354.5s)]
*  And if a target, if we have predication, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1358.98s)]
*  or predicated target, or there's information coming in [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1363.46s)]
*  about somebody doing something nefarious, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1366.22s)]
*  if we want to do an undercover, how do I get close to you? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1369.42s)]
*  I mean, what do you find attractive? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1372.8600000000001s)]
*  Usually, it's money in the criminal world. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1374.42s)]
*  It's green, right? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1376.5s)]
*  You can see the Mexican mafia working with the Aryan [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1377.8600000000001s)]
*  Brotherhood of Texas. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1380.14s)]
*  They hate each other, but they love green. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1382.0200000000002s)]
*  And one needs guns, and one needs dope, and you know it all [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1384.94s)]
*  in the criminal world. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1388.5s)]
*  But for that case, I went up. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1389.66s)]
*  I got interviewed by, of course, the FBI. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1393.18s)]
*  There were task forces there. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1398.58s)]
*  DEA was there. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1399.82s)]
*  ATF was there. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1401.02s)]
*  And they had been working this case for a while. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1402.46s)]
*  And generally, this is the way it would work for me [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1404.62s)]
*  on these long-term type undercovers. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1407.22s)]
*  The case team's been working this for a long time, a year [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1409.54s)]
*  plus. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1412.34s)]
*  They've been building intelligence. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1413.1799999999998s)]
*  Now, they've got some evidence already, maybe a seizure, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1414.62s)]
*  a dope here, report of a carjacking here. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1418.1799999999998s)]
*  But to get that airtight case and to find out [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1421.74s)]
*  what's really going on, now they're [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1424.4199999999998s)]
*  at the point to where they can use the investigative technique, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1426.38s)]
*  which is undercover. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1428.8600000000001s)]
*  And we came up with a plan. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1430.46s)]
*  And I went in cold. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1434.42s)]
*  I tried to bump them, as we say, cold bump. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1436.74s)]
*  But I went into a bar that they frequented. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1440.8200000000002s)]
*  I went there when they weren't there. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1444.46s)]
*  It was a strip club. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1446.0600000000002s)]
*  I used to bounce at strip clubs. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1447.3000000000002s)]
*  In the book, I make a joke because I call them [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1448.7800000000002s)]
*  a gentleman's club, but then I say that's an oxymoron [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1452.2600000000002s)]
*  because everyone I've been in, there's not a lot of gentlemen [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1454.58s)]
*  in there, and that includes me back in the whatever days [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1458.46s)]
*  I were. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1461.1799999999998s)]
*  But I knew how they work. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1462.54s)]
*  So I went in there, and I just started hanging out. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1463.82s)]
*  And of course, this accident in Boston, Massachusetts, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1466.02s)]
*  I'm getting noticed as soon as I start talking. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1470.6599999999999s)]
*  Where the hell are you from? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1472.6999999999998s)]
*  And I kind of worked that and started working the bar, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1474.1799999999998s)]
*  doing what I do. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1477.62s)]
*  Everybody has their own way. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1479.3799999999999s)]
*  And let me say this, since it's at the beginning, listen, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1481.58s)]
*  for me, I want people to know it comes from a humble spot. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1485.3s)]
*  There are men and women out there that have done way more [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1488.54s)]
*  undercovers than me. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1491.18s)]
*  They have been through more harrowing things than me. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1492.46s)]
*  I already said, I've got mentors, I've got peers, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1494.74s)]
*  I've got people, I've been blessed a mentor. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1497.1399999999999s)]
*  Some of them don't want to talk. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1499.62s)]
*  Some of them haven't had the opportunity. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1501.86s)]
*  So just know it's coming from a love kind of place. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1503.82s)]
*  Got it. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1506.82s)]
*  So when you say you work in the bar, what do you mean? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1507.34s)]
*  You just like making friends with people there? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1509.5s)]
*  What I did last night here in Austin. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1511.8999999999999s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1515.1399999999999s)]
*  Isn't it like old habits die hard? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1515.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I just walk out like, hey man, how's it going? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1517.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1519.9399999999998s)]
*  It's like catch and release. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1520.4599999999998s)]
*  You're like pretending. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1521.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's still working your gab. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1522.62s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1525.1s)]
*  So you're always working your skill set, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1525.8999999999999s)]
*  even though you're not on the job anymore. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1527.5s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1528.8999999999999s)]
*  I love connecting with people. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1530.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't care whether you're smart, stupid, big, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1531.3799999999999s)]
*  skinny, fat, any ethnicity, doesn't matter. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1535.62s)]
*  And that's one thing I do miss about the job. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1538.4199999999998s)]
*  I miss getting called out at 10 in the morning [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1540.34s)]
*  for the craziest of the crazies. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1542.26s)]
*  And you show up to do an interview. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1544.02s)]
*  And essentially, I befriend you. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1545.58s)]
*  And you either confess or we find out you really [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1548.82s)]
*  won't do anything. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1551.46s)]
*  I do remember one night, this wasn't undercover, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1552.3s)]
*  but they called me because towards the end of my career, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1554.7s)]
*  I was doing nothing but mainly domestic terrorism. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1557.18s)]
*  And they called me, we got one down here. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1559.82s)]
*  He's a white supremacist. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1561.58s)]
*  He's assaulted a cop. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1563.02s)]
*  This, that, and the other. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1563.86s)]
*  Will I get down there? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1564.94s)]
*  It's like 3, 4 in the morning now. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1565.98s)]
*  I do my spiel. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1567.86s)]
*  I'm not screaming at the guy. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1568.58s)]
*  Man, you need something to drink. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1569.82s)]
*  Here, man, you look cold. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1571.02s)]
*  Here's a coat. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1572.06s)]
*  So tell me about what happened. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1573.06s)]
*  I'm not here for this other stuff. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1574.22s)]
*  And I start talking. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1575.74s)]
*  Well, somewhere in there, I'm like, OK, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1577.5s)]
*  this guy's not a white supremacist. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1579.18s)]
*  He's a sovereign citizen. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1580.34s)]
*  And he's just anti-government. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1582.58s)]
*  Pro sheriff, elected, but anti-government. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1584.46s)]
*  Sovereign citizens, I really can't stand to deal with them. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1587.42s)]
*  It's just like absurdity to the max. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1590.18s)]
*  Explain sovereign citizens to people. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1593.7s)]
*  You see it all over YouTube. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1596.02s)]
*  They get pulled over and they don't need a driver's license. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1599.1s)]
*  I'm in commerce. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1602.02s)]
*  I'm in transit. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1603.06s)]
*  If they touch you, well, that's rape. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1603.98s)]
*  They think they've got a hundred and I'm going to forget it, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1605.98s)]
*  but it's like a hundred and seventy five, two hundred fifty thousand dollars [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1608.62s)]
*  being held by the government for each person. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1611.62s)]
*  It's crazy. They'll start putting liens on people. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1613.94s)]
*  People put on trainings. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1617.86s)]
*  So when it first started happening, a cop pulls you over [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1618.94s)]
*  and they see like this thing signed in blood and the paperwork looks legit. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1621.78s)]
*  But I never got that training. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1625.26s)]
*  Is this legit? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1626.7s)]
*  You know, I guess I can't pull this guy over. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1627.58s)]
*  Then you start diving in, you start getting the training. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1629.74s)]
*  These people are full of crap. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1632.26s)]
*  Then you see the cops popping the window and dragging them out of the car. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1633.82s)]
*  You're still going. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1636.9399999999998s)]
*  But this guy was a sovereign citizen. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1638.1s)]
*  He had a brother and we're talking and he's telling me this stuff [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1640.26s)]
*  and the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1646.1s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, yeah. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1649.4199999999998s)]
*  And I said, but how do you know that's what the forefathers meant [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1650.8999999999999s)]
*  when they signed that? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1654.54s)]
*  And he said, because I was there, son. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1655.98s)]
*  Oh, boy. And that's when I went. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1657.74s)]
*  Oh, he's not just a sovereign citizen. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1661.9s)]
*  He's a cook. He's crazy. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1663.5s)]
*  Why did it take me this long to find out? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1666.14s)]
*  He said I was there. Yeah, I was like this. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1667.7s)]
*  He goes, because I didn't miss a beat. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1669.94s)]
*  I go, how do you know? Because I was there, son. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1671.46s)]
*  And I went there. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1673.7s)]
*  Oh, you've been reincarnated about four or five times. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1675.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, and I'm like, and you got this life this time? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1679.14s)]
*  You got the one you're living right now this time. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1683.14s)]
*  What are you talking to me for in the morning? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1685.82s)]
*  You look like you've had a rough life. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1688.74s)]
*  I mean, I would, you know, if I was going to buy into, you know, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1690.3s)]
*  reincarnation, I'd want to come back as maybe like my mom's dog [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1693.78s)]
*  or something like that, you know, something. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1696.62s)]
*  Yeah, something get this great life, sleep, eat and play. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1698.86s)]
*  But so back to the the outlaws thing, I go in [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1703.34s)]
*  and I'm just shooting the shit. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1707.66s)]
*  I'm just working the bar. I'm telling jokes. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1708.86s)]
*  You get a crowd of people around you and that's no that's not trade. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1711.34s)]
*  I mean, that's just me. Right. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1714.34s)]
*  And by the way, for the listeners who may not know, little intervention. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1716.1399999999999s)]
*  If you buy all your friends, all their drinks and their food all the time, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1721.6599999999999s)]
*  they're probably not your friends. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1726.6999999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1728.98s)]
*  I got all kinds of friends. Those aren't your friends. Right. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1730.9399999999998s)]
*  Stop paying. They won't come around anymore. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1733.4199999999998s)]
*  But that's kind of what I was doing. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1735.54s)]
*  And then now we get to the night to where the outlaws are leaving their clubhouse. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1737.5s)]
*  And for the listeners that don't know in the biker world, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1742.78s)]
*  especially one percenter world, there's a mandatory meeting every week [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1744.94s)]
*  at a clubhouse and they refer to it as church. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1747.5s)]
*  So they're leaving church. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1750.3s)]
*  I get the surveillance team telling me, hey, man, we're leaving church. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1751.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, cool. I'm at the bar already. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1753.74s)]
*  The Foxy Lady in Brockton, Massachusetts. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1756.5s)]
*  And that's a rough town. Right. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1759.3s)]
*  And marvelous Marvin Hagler. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1761.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I go for a jog and I get all the more. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1763.74s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1767.42s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. But [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1769.1s)]
*  they tell me they're coming. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1771.7s)]
*  Now, the intelligence that they provided me when we started [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1772.78s)]
*  getting this case together, I was like, hey, man, can they wear their colors, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1775.3s)]
*  their cuts, their leathers in the bar? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1778.06s)]
*  And they said, no, they don't allow that. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1780.54s)]
*  And I'm thinking in my mind, well, that makes my approach easier [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1781.82s)]
*  because I'm not tattooed guy [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1784.5s)]
*  watching naked women listening to heavy metal and drinking [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1787.1399999999999s)]
*  next to a guy who's watching naked women and heavy metal drinking. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1790.4199999999998s)]
*  They had that part wrong because about 13, 15 outlaws come walking into the bar, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1793.98s)]
*  take the whole back bar. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1798.7s)]
*  They're all wearing their colors. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1799.8600000000001s)]
*  So that does that change my approach? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1801.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think it does. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1804.74s)]
*  Yeah. Unless you want me to go up. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1805.98s)]
*  And as I say, when I'm teaching this, I go up and I go, what do you say? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1807.42s)]
*  Come on, go. Hey, you you boys, right? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1809.74s)]
*  Nothing. No. All right. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1815.14s)]
*  Fine. I'll just I'm going to go back on the other side of the bar. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1816.9s)]
*  Please don't beat my ass. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1819.9s)]
*  So I just was being loud and boisterous. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1822.3400000000001s)]
*  It's me. That's what I do. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1825.5s)]
*  It doesn't always work for undercovers. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1828.3s)]
*  Some people don't like it, but it's my personality. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1829.98s)]
*  Are you allowed to get drunk? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1832.02s)]
*  Boy, that's a tricky question. Yes, I can drink. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1834.8999999999999s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1837.86s)]
*  Let's say that outlaws case, that was two years. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1839.74s)]
*  So there's two years of recordings of you seeing me turn a Jack and Coke up. Right. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1842.4199999999998s)]
*  I was I'm anal, even though I look and sound like trash on paper, I'm pretty tight. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1848.54s)]
*  And I wanted to be good. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1853.5s)]
*  I wanted to always get better and be more well rounded. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1855.18s)]
*  So I would watch. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1857.82s)]
*  And even if I caught myself at five in the morning, six in the morning, slurring, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1859.1399999999999s)]
*  as I'm listening to it, I'd be like, dead, come on, man. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1863.58s)]
*  And then I'd listen. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1866.3s)]
*  And within five minutes, I'd be back because you got to remember [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1867.4199999999998s)]
*  all that could be played in front of a jury. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1870.4199999999998s)]
*  And if I'm on there slurring and saying a bunch of stupid stuff. Right. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1872.7s)]
*  I mean, how does that affect my articulation for what I was doing? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1875.98s)]
*  But was my alcohol tolerance very high? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1880.4199999999998s)]
*  And you're a big dude. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1883.1799999999998s)]
*  Probably put some way. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1884.54s)]
*  I did kind of still do. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1885.78s)]
*  I did. I'll tell you what. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1888.46s)]
*  What put me on a three month timeout with CPI. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1890.82s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1893.78s)]
*  Because you go down there and you get the explained it. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1894.74s)]
*  We're talking about the cellular performance institute that my friends [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1897.4199999999998s)]
*  run down in Tijuana. Absolutely. Great, great facility. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1901.02s)]
*  I will tell you the. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1904.7s)]
*  My previous hospital visit before I went to Tijuana, I almost died. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1906.82s)]
*  I had a hip replacement and it got steps. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1911.26s)]
*  I got sepsis and almost died. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1914.34s)]
*  So 14 days after my total hip replacement, quickest surgery I've ever had. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1916.78s)]
*  About 30 minutes, chopped the femur off, drill it, pop. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1920.06s)]
*  They're walking you out. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1922.74s)]
*  You're still very high on all your. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1923.58s)]
*  They're like, if you can walk, you can go home. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1926.3s)]
*  And I'm like, I can't walk. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1927.74s)]
*  But apparently something happened. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1930.3s)]
*  They got infected. So 14 days later, I had sepsis and they got it under control. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1932.3s)]
*  And they went back in and cleaned me all out. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1936.74s)]
*  I had two hip surgeries in 14 days. But fast. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1938.38s)]
*  So now I'm going to Tijuana, knowing what I know about working the border. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1941.34s)]
*  No, even though I'm friends with Ed and Scotty, the owners, and I'm like, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1944.82s)]
*  I'm like, man, now I'm going by myself. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1950.74s)]
*  Best hospital stay I've ever had. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1954.3s)]
*  So yeah, it's phenomenal. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1956.34s)]
*  It's an amazing place. Phenomenal. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1958.1s)]
*  And what? But what? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1959.78s)]
*  Stopped cut back on my drinking is I got down there. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1961.26s)]
*  You can't drink the week before, especially if you're getting the IV stem cells, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1964.46s)]
*  because they travel through your body and they grab stuff. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1968.74s)]
*  So if you drink and it sees your liver working harder, it's going to go to your liver. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1970.86s)]
*  So you're kind of wasting the shots. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1973.94s)]
*  I knew I couldn't drink the week before I got there. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1976.9s)]
*  And they go, yes, you can't drink for three more months. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1978.94s)]
*  And I went three months. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1980.66s)]
*  And they're like, I said, they ain't nobody told me that. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1982.5s)]
*  And I was like, you know, I immediately went, I need to cut back anyway. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1985.26s)]
*  That's fine. You know. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1988.6200000000001s)]
*  But yeah, tolerance was high for you. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1990.1000000000001s)]
*  You have to be drinking with these folks when you're hanging out. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1993.22s)]
*  You don't have to. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1995.98s)]
*  But this will go back to an explanation of the undercover school. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=1997.42s)]
*  If you're going to drink, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2001.18s)]
*  we want you to drink in a controlled environment when you're tired, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2003.34s)]
*  because we want you to see how you feel. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2006.8999999999999s)]
*  We also want to see how you behave [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2008.86s)]
*  when you're extremely tired and you're plastered. Right. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2011.6999999999998s)]
*  So you have to know that, in other words, you don't want to find out [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2016.1799999999998s)]
*  in the middle of the clubhouse that you can't handle your shit. Right. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2019.1799999999998s)]
*  So, yeah, I I you can drink. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2024.6599999999999s)]
*  And but you're being recorded. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2028.6599999999999s)]
*  So be wary about wary about it. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2031.14s)]
*  What about drug use? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2034.5800000000002s)]
*  This is what I get is, is this tradecraft or not? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2037.7800000000002s)]
*  Maybe this is the easiest way to say it. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2043.98s)]
*  If I believe my life is in danger and like literally I'm getting ready to die, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2046.1000000000001s)]
*  I will snort the lacquer finish off of this damn table. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2051.46s)]
*  And I'll be like, is that is that all you got? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2057.06s)]
*  You want me to do some more? Right. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2058.94s)]
*  Because I really don't feel like dying right now. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2060.78s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by LifeLock. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2062.98s)]
*  Tax season is already stressful. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2065.7000000000003s)]
*  You shouldn't have to worry about identity theft on top of everything else. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2068.1400000000003s)]

*  Just without answering it completely. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2161.98s)]
*  Yeah, let me give you this. You're going to trial. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2164.46s)]
*  We've got a two year case against you. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2168.18s)]
*  And I'm up here articulating what I did. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2170.66s)]
*  It's in my documents. It's in the recordings. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2173.9s)]
*  And we have built this case. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2176.74s)]
*  Usually with undercover cases, in my experience, the evidence is so overwhelming. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2180.18s)]
*  The only thing the defense can can claim is entrapment, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2184.98s)]
*  which you should be able to shoot that down pretty quick if you've done your due diligence. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2188.7799999999997s)]
*  Or they try to make you look like a piece of trash on the stand. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2192.66s)]
*  So imagine if they're saying, well, he did dope with us. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2195.74s)]
*  You need to be able to articulate, did you? Why did you? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2199.02s)]
*  That's more movie stuff. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2202.02s)]
*  It does happen on on levels. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2203.7s)]
*  And I wish it didn't. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2206.18s)]
*  But it happens on levels where people don't have training. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2207.3799999999997s)]
*  And that's that's sad because there have been plenty of people. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2211.62s)]
*  Let's just use biker gangs from law enforcement, from local small [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2215.02s)]
*  department all the way up to feds that have infiltrated biker gangs [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2219.1s)]
*  that have patched and gotten their colors. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2222.2999999999997s)]
*  But the cases went to crap. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2224.2599999999998s)]
*  They lost themselves. They lost their marriage. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2226.06s)]
*  They became addicted to drugs. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2228.2599999999998s)]
*  So we shouldn't be. There's no case worth that. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2230.18s)]
*  That's the best way to say it. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2232.94s)]
*  There's no case worth you getting addicted to drugs or endangering yourself. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2234.1800000000003s)]
*  Just walk. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2238.1000000000004s)]
*  So what is the dance of getting to the bar, becoming a regular [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2239.02s)]
*  and then eventually getting to know these guys? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2244.2200000000003s)]
*  So that first night, I'm being loud and boisterous. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2248.0600000000004s)]
*  And they did say that there was one particular member [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2251.54s)]
*  who loved to be the center of attention and he loved to be surrounded by big dudes. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2254.5800000000004s)]
*  Take that for what you want. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2260.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't know. I didn't dive too deep into that one. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2261.42s)]
*  But when you say hang out with the surrounding [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2263.26s)]
*  wiser jar Vaseline, what kind of party is this? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2269.2200000000003s)]
*  What's with the cameras? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2272.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2273.54s)]
*  Hey, Scott, have a drink of this before you come in here and sign this NDA. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2276.9s)]
*  Yeah. What? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2279.98s)]
*  What? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2280.78s)]
*  So I start befriending them and I'm being allowed to take it back. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2283.58s)]
*  I'm being allowed. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2287.26s)]
*  This guy did like attention. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2288.46s)]
*  He sees it and he's like, hey, hey, where the F are you from? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2290.78s)]
*  So I fire some stupid comedy thing back. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2297.82s)]
*  We start going back and forth because he's already asked the bartenders, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2300.5s)]
*  who the hell is that guy? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2303.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh, that's Tex. He comes up here all the time from Texas. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2304.98s)]
*  That's human nature. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2308.78s)]
*  It's like, you know, you caught a fish this big by the 10th person you're telling. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2309.6200000000003s)]
*  There was like 10 of them. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2313.26s)]
*  I had to fight them off with my pinkies. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2314.7400000000002s)]
*  But I get called over. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2317.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know who sent a drink to who first, but he calls me over [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2321.22s)]
*  and just starts shooting the shit with me. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2324.2599999999998s)]
*  And from then, he pretty much invites me to one of their northeast [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2325.9399999999996s)]
*  regionals called Lobster Fest held in Brockton at that clubhouse. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2329.74s)]
*  And we were kind of on the way. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2334.9399999999996s)]
*  There was a guy who was not patched and his name was Scott as well. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2337.3399999999997s)]
*  I said the name of the book is all it's all adjudicated. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2342.9399999999996s)]
*  It's all in the court proceedings and stuff. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2345.46s)]
*  But Scott Town was his name and he was a big dude. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2348.46s)]
*  He was jacked and he came in. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2352.3s)]
*  I remember going to the bathroom and again, I think I'm doing pretty good. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2355.06s)]
*  Like I'm in great shape and I'm being me. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2359.54s)]
*  I'm talking, shooting the shit, not hanging out too much. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2361.26s)]
*  I walk back over, play a little, you know, you come chase me kind of thing. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2363.5s)]
*  So I go to the bathroom and nobody's in there. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2368.26s)]
*  And for the listeners that don't know men's bathrooms and bars, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2370.26s)]
*  usually at the urinal, there's some kind of box plexiglass with some kind of ads [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2374.42s)]
*  like, hey, this person's coming next week, that stuff. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2378.06s)]
*  So as I'm peeing, I'm looking at the reflection and I see the door swing open [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2381.02s)]
*  and I see this jack dude, Scott. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2385.9s)]
*  It must have made an impression because in the report, I even say he's wearing [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2388.42s)]
*  a gray shirt with black trim. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2392.02s)]
*  He's completely sleeved out. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2393.78s)]
*  And I'm getting all this, you know, sleeved out on the left arm, huge earrings. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2394.9s)]
*  And I watch him and I see him kind of ducking and looking under stalls. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2400.5s)]
*  And hitting the doors to make sure nobody else is in the bathroom. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2404.46s)]
*  I'm acting nonchalant, but then I see him walk up to me. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2407.9s)]
*  And for that split second, I thought I'm getting jacked. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2410.82s)]
*  I'm going to get jumped right here. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2413.3s)]
*  But he ends up just asking me, what brings you to Massachusetts? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2415.9s)]
*  I think what happened is they sent him in there to press me. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2419.1800000000003s)]
*  And this is a good lesson. Don't bluff. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2423.14s)]
*  If you bluff, whatever you say today, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2425.58s)]
*  you might be still in that case a year and a half, two years later. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2430.3s)]
*  It needs to match what you said on day one, or you could be slipping up [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2433.94s)]
*  and getting found out. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2438.5s)]
*  But I said where I'd been around, McAllen grew up in South Carolina, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2440.1800000000003s)]
*  all this stuff, he'd been to all those places because he used to travel [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2445.0600000000004s)]
*  the country fighting dogs. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2447.6600000000003s)]
*  So if I'd have been bluffing, I'd have been done right there. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2448.86s)]
*  And then from there, we start building relationships. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2451.82s)]
*  Now I'm trying to ingratiate and I'm getting invited to parties. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2454.86s)]
*  They my story was that I was a site survey specialist [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2459.6200000000003s)]
*  and I traveled the country for investors out of Texas. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2463.1s)]
*  And I would look at properties that they want to buy, whether it was [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2466.6200000000003s)]
*  whether it's residential or mercantile and, you know, pull stuff [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2469.46s)]
*  from the clerk of court and all that kind of stuff. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2472.42s)]
*  But as it usually does in the criminal world, it came out [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2475.34s)]
*  that I also did some crimes myself. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2479.38s)]
*  And that's when we started getting into [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2481.78s)]
*  they were doing insurance fraud first with me. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2484.82s)]
*  They would report vehicles stolen and then sell them to me for a stolen price. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2488.1400000000003s)]
*  And the story was, since I was based out of McAllen, Texas, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2492.18s)]
*  I'm just using the facts that we were moving vehicles to Mexico [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2495.1s)]
*  in trade for whatever guns, most likely dope, but whatever. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2500.06s)]
*  And that's how we started. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2504.66s)]
*  And then from there, now you start gaining more trust. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2506.14s)]
*  You start hanging out more. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2508.8599999999997s)]
*  You become tighter. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2510.46s)]
*  You're building these relationships. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2511.7799999999997s)]
*  And then it's like, hey, we just carjacked somebody. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2514.62s)]
*  We got this car. We took this dude at gunpoint. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2518.2599999999998s)]
*  This thing's got low Jack or on star or whatever was around. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2520.34s)]
*  And then we got to get rid of it. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2522.6200000000003s)]
*  Don't worry about it. I got it. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2524.46s)]
*  Have a truck driver show up. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2525.9s)]
*  We load all the stolen equipment, vehicles, whatever on the truck. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2527.34s)]
*  And they thought they were going to Mexico, but they were just going [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2531.9s)]
*  to a warehouse somewhere in Massachusetts. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2534.46s)]
*  So you never actually brought cars to Mexico. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2536.7000000000003s)]
*  No. So when you would do that, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2539.94s)]
*  we just get cash from the FBI to like represent. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2542.3s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they would I would pay them. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2546.3s)]
*  Yeah. A stolen price, usually stolen is usually [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2548.14s)]
*  20 to 25 percent of what it would normally cost, you know, because it's hot. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2552.62s)]
*  And that just started gaining trust. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2557.66s)]
*  I mean, like I said, there was other undercovers that would help. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2558.8599999999997s)]
*  We call this cameos. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2562.42s)]
*  If you're the primary undercover, that's you. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2565.06s)]
*  That's your case. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2567.3399999999997s)]
*  A secondary undercover might mean you come in to meet me, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2568.58s)]
*  but you stay with me for a couple of days and we go out and meet bad guys together. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2570.94s)]
*  That's going to be a secondary role. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2574.2999999999997s)]
*  If you're coming in as a truck driver, you're just pulling the parking lot. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2575.58s)]
*  We're loading up stuff. That's a cameo. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2578.5s)]
*  And I've done many cameos for other undercovers as well. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2580.38s)]
*  You know, just rolling to town, do a deal, whatever. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2583.58s)]
*  So no one's ever trying to go with you to Mexico to make sure that all this is [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2587.06s)]
*  happening. Not on that case. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2590.7s)]
*  But if they did want to, we would have to work that out. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2591.8199999999997s)]
*  We would have to have that kind of. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2594.42s)]
*  Because I took this from a buddy of mine who who I helped certify as an undercover. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2595.66s)]
*  And I just thought it was a great way to say it. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2602.7799999999997s)]
*  It's look. At the end of the day, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2604.42s)]
*  we want that target going to bed thinking that was a good day. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2608.34s)]
*  You don't want them laying in bed going, man, there's something [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2612.78s)]
*  went right about that guy. Something something's not right. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2616.1800000000003s)]
*  Because you want it to be as real as possible. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2619.26s)]
*  So is it was it a fact that the cartels at that point in time [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2621.38s)]
*  loved four by four V8s and Harley Davison's? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2626.82s)]
*  Absolutely. That they get stolen all the time on the border. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2629.54s)]
*  Absolutely. So that's that's factual stuff that's real. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2633.5s)]
*  So now I'm a guy they they they eventually learned and believe that I was a high [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2638.1000000000004s)]
*  ranking, high ranking member of an international theft ring. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2642.7000000000003s)]
*  And that's what we were doing. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2647.2200000000003s)]
*  And then through those through those, then they start stealing vehicles, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2648.3s)]
*  which I got to be careful of. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2651.6600000000003s)]
*  I can't say, hey, I want to I want a brand new F350 quad cab, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2652.9s)]
*  because then they can steal it. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2656.78s)]
*  I that's somewhat of entrapment. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2657.78s)]
*  I just led them to go steal that car. Right. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2659.78s)]
*  But over the next year or so, we're getting more and more stuff. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2663.38s)]
*  I buy dope from them. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2667.9s)]
*  Like I said, car jackings, we learned of them. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2670.38s)]
*  Certain members extorting people like the good old mafia days, you know, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2673.78s)]
*  extorting businesses, home invasions. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2677.5800000000004s)]
*  But again, for the listeners listening to hear that at a bar and say, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2681.6200000000003s)]
*  yeah, we robbed that house. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2685.3s)]
*  Is that enough to charge somebody? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2687.1000000000004s)]
*  Probably not. As an assistant United States attorney, going to be like, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2688.9s)]
*  yeah, that's enough. No, we're going to have to dive in more and find out [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2691.46s)]
*  and vet it out and get that evidence. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2694.38s)]
*  Wow. Stressful shit. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2696.38s)]
*  Slightly getting stressed out just thinking about you doing all these things. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2699.38s)]
*  Me too. So how how long is this relationship while you're building a case? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2702.34s)]
*  Like how how much time are you spending with these people? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2707.5s)]
*  I was for that case. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2710.9s)]
*  I was probably up there every three weeks for a good week. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2712.1800000000003s)]
*  But then this constant contact when I'm not there. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2714.94s)]
*  Next messages. Yeah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2717.82s)]
*  Well, next tells we're big with them at that point in time. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2719.14s)]
*  So, yeah, that's the church. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2721.46s)]
*  The old days, the walkie talkie radio. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2723.34s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2725.34s)]
*  A little funny. People forgot about them. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2726.3s)]
*  Yeah, talking. Yeah, man. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2727.9s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2730.06s)]
*  But you could key up and talk to somebody in Japan and it'd be Chris or Cree. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2731.14s)]
*  But if you tried to call somebody, it was the worst connection ever. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2734.9s)]
*  Yeah, there were terrible phones. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2737.38s)]
*  But that's what they used. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2738.78s)]
*  And that's what I got. I was mirroring them. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2739.94s)]
*  But yes, you build those relationships and it depends. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2742.42s)]
*  Each case is different. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2745.3s)]
*  But I will say that the tightest relationship [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2746.2200000000003s)]
*  I had on that case was Scott town. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2749.7s)]
*  It was absolutely scary how similar we were [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2752.7s)]
*  and how tight we were. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2757.02s)]
*  Now, again, he didn't know I was Scott Payne, FBI undercover. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2758.98s)]
*  But he knew I was Scott Calloway. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2762.1s)]
*  And he knew I mean, it would be to the point to where [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2763.98s)]
*  if we were going out to do an op that evening, an operation, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2767.9399999999996s)]
*  they wouldn't put it in the operations plan, but they would ask, Hey, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2773.02s)]
*  Scott, I'm going to be there tonight. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2775.46s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2776.54s)]
*  And even the FBI cover teams, it's that would be like good [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2777.18s)]
*  because they knew that he cared enough about me. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2780.3399999999997s)]
*  He'd take a bullet for me and protect me and vice versa, really. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2783.3399999999997s)]
*  As me and Scott Calloway. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2786.8199999999997s)]
*  And I mean, we finished each other's sentences. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2788.2599999999998s)]
*  We thought the same other than the criminal stuff [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2791.54s)]
*  and some faith belief systems. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2795.3399999999997s)]
*  But yeah, that was my tightest. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2798.1s)]
*  And the second one over the two years was probably a guy [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2800.74s)]
*  whose road name was Closeline. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2804.02s)]
*  And he was the enforcer for the Taunton chapter. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2805.66s)]
*  And then after that, it probably would have been the president, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2807.98s)]
*  which was Joe Dawgs, and then it just trickles down from there. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2809.98s)]
*  Do you have conflicted feelings when you develop [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2812.54s)]
*  like these relationships with these guys? I did. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2815.3799999999997s)]
*  You can put on as much training. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2819.94s)]
*  You can get the training. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2821.74s)]
*  You can be a part of it. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2823.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm still human. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2824.66s)]
*  You know, now was I to a point to where I'm going to go? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2826.02s)]
*  I'm leaving the FBI and I'm going to become the center. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2829.46s)]
*  Some people do, though. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2833.58s)]
*  I know some people do, but I wasn't there. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2834.46s)]
*  I wouldn't. I wouldn't do. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2836.54s)]
*  How often does that happen? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2837.5s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2839.78s)]
*  In the FBI, probably not a lot. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2841.94s)]
*  But those cases are well known if something happens like that. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2843.86s)]
*  Somebody goes rogue like, you know, your breach story and [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2846.18s)]
*  all these people selling secrets and getting people killed. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2849.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't there. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2851.94s)]
*  Nor would I be. I wouldn't be. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2854.02s)]
*  I would like to think if I did have a one percenter club, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2855.86s)]
*  nobody would ever infiltrate it, though. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2857.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, you probably understand how it works. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2859.94s)]
*  But even then, yeah, I mean, you're dealing with [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2862.98s)]
*  ragamuffin people. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2866.06s)]
*  Yeah, no, no. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2867.7s)]
*  But those are like, again, those are my kinds of people. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2869.18s)]
*  When we're riding around and we're people are [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2871.54s)]
*  wrestling each other over tables. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2874.2599999999998s)]
*  This is my favorite move. Bang. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2875.86s)]
*  I mean, at one point, I'm driving down the road with Scott Town in a snow storm [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2877.66s)]
*  and I'm driving and I'm like this with my hand. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2881.58s)]
*  He reaches over out of nowhere and breaks my pinky. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2884.8199999999997s)]
*  Just pop. And this sucker's like 90 degrees. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2887.86s)]
*  And I'm like, Motherfuck. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2890.7s)]
*  I pulled over, I slammed on the brake. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2892.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, I mean, snow. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2893.98s)]
*  Come to the stop and I go, what the F is your problem? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2895.58s)]
*  And he's looking at me, he's going, hey, I don't know what he was on. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2899.1s)]
*  But he was in an evil space. Right. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2902.8999999999996s)]
*  And I'm looking at him and I'm going, look, if you want to F and fight, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2904.9399999999996s)]
*  we'll stand out in the damn snowstorm right now and we'll go at it. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2908.62s)]
*  I know you think you can whip me, but maybe I can whip you. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2911.3799999999997s)]
*  And I saw it wasn't going anywhere. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2914.46s)]
*  And he was getting more and more angry. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2915.9399999999996s)]
*  And I just looked at him and I went, he's an animal right now. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2917.62s)]
*  I'm going to diffuse. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2921.62s)]
*  I'm going to deescalate, which is really what you should be doing as an undercover. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2922.66s)]
*  And I look over and I go, hey, hey, after I pop my finger in, I go, hey, sniff, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2927.74s)]
*  smell, good boy, friend, friend like that. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2932.94s)]
*  I'm trying to calm it down. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2938.38s)]
*  And he starts laughing. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2939.1s)]
*  But that's the kind of stuff you get. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2940.2999999999997s)]
*  But to me, it was no different than being in college playing ball, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2941.66s)]
*  hanging out with psychos. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2945.06s)]
*  Yeah. When you're there in the month of August and nobody is there, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2945.94s)]
*  it's just 24 seven football. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2949.02s)]
*  What was it like when you eventually brought that guy down? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2950.86s)]
*  It was sad. It was sad because in that case, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2953.42s)]
*  there was a point where I, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2959.5s)]
*  I had a young daughter and his youngest daughter was roughly the same age as my [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2962.66s)]
*  daughter. So I'm not at home with my kid, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2967.86s)]
*  but I'm in his house bouncing his daughter on my lap. And the, and you know, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2970.7400000000002s)]
*  when they're developing as a human being there at that stage, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2974.38s)]
*  they're kind of making the same noises, moving the same way. It was, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2978.9s)]
*  it was surreal. And then I remember thinking, man, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2982.22s)]
*  I mean, I really liked this guy, you know, he likes to drink. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2986.5s)]
*  I liked the drink. He likes to fight. I liked to fight. He likes to ride. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2989.22s)]
*  I liked to ride. He likes to live. I liked to live. I go, man, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2992.46s)]
*  we finished each other since everything already said. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2994.38s)]
*  And then I look over at his refrigerator and, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=2996.58s)]
*  and I see all these stickers and magnets and stuff. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3000.58s)]
*  And my eyes just settled in on WWSD. And for the listeners that don't know, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3003.22s)]
*  WWJD is very common in the Christ follower Christian community. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3007.5s)]
*  What would Jesus do? You see the bracelets all the time. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3011.8199999999997s)]
*  And I look over and said, WWSD, what would Satan do? And I looked and I went, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3015.18s)]
*  oh yeah, we're not the same. We're not the, I'm back. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3018.9s)]
*  I used to, we'd be in the clubhouse and everybody's yelling there like, you know, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3023.94s)]
*  if for the, again, people that don't know, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3027.14s)]
*  whatever your biker club name is, you usually get these same sayings. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3029.22s)]
*  So for the outlaws is outlaws forever, forever outlaws. Hell yeah. Yeah. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3033.1s)]
*  Yeah. God forgives outlaws don't. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3038.2999999999997s)]
*  It's better to be first in hell than second heaven. And I'm like, what? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3042.5s)]
*  T hang on. I'm like, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3048.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm a chalk walk in Christian cause I'm pretending to be a one [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3051.3399999999997s)]
*  percenter, you know, evil man, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3054.8599999999997s)]
*  but what story have you ever heard of hell where it was good? I mean, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3056.5s)]
*  you helping me out here. So yeah, it's a crazy bunch. But on that case, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3060.58s)]
*  one of the biggest things that happened is we had been going for a year and a [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3065.14s)]
*  half and doing all these things. They've car jack stuff. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3069.78s)]
*  We're getting more and more evidence. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3074.06s)]
*  There was a hell's angel president murdered in [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3075.18s)]
*  Connecticut, Bridgeport, Connecticut. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3079.78s)]
*  Terrible town. Terrible. Is it? Oh, Bridgeport is dangerous. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3081.58s)]
*  So Bridgeport, Connecticut and the other hell's angel that was shot didn't die. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3085.7s)]
*  And he was able to give a description of a green truck with Florida plates. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3092.7s)]
*  We knew at that time that Florida outlaws were up in that area cause they were [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3097.5s)]
*  hanging out with our targets. And even when I would call, I'd be like, Hey man, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3101.14s)]
*  man, it's hot here right now. If you come out, you need to be strapped. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3105.74s)]
*  And I'm like, well, I don't want to fly with it. I don't want to put a bullseye [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3108.2999999999997s)]
*  on my back back then. I'm like, if I show up and we'll give you a vest, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3111.18s)]
*  we'll give you a gun kind of thing. So we're doing all that. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3115.38s)]
*  And now we get to the point to where we can all the predications there. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3118.94s)]
*  Uh, they've done wiretaps. The case team has been doing a wiretap. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3123.62s)]
*  They know that there's drug deals going on. They're doing surveillance. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3127.1800000000003s)]
*  And now we're to the point to where, uh, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3129.9s)]
*  we can introduce that I used to be in the dope game as well. Um, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3132.82s)]
*  my story was that the reason I got out of it and only did the [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3137.6600000000003s)]
*  stolen stuff was because some of my peeps got popped because the heat was getting [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3142.54s)]
*  close. So I pulled chocks and I was out. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3147.88s)]
*  And all I do now is move stolen equipment down because it's a lot less. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3150.3s)]
*  Uh, the way I explained it, it was less likely for law enforcement to catch me. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3156.06s)]
*  And, and then they would ask, you know, well, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3159.98s)]
*  how come a white guy is not cut out by all these Mexicans you're working with? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3162.06s)]
*  And I go, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3165.78s)]
*  because I'm the gringo that has the contact at the port of entry and the [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3166.18s)]
*  contacts at the checkpoints to pay them 15 grand to turn their head for two [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3169.14s)]
*  minutes and let our stuff go through. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3173.02s)]
*  And that was really happening on the border. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3174.7799999999997s)]
*  And I knew that because I was on the border working it again, real things. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3176.3399999999997s)]
*  You're just, you're just putting them into your story. Um, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3179.94s)]
*  but I'd now let them know it took a long time. I don't put words in their mouth. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3183.18s)]
*  Um, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3188.54s)]
*  but I started laying breadcrumbs over weeks and months that I did used to be in [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3189.46s)]
*  the dope game. And of course, Joe dogs, the president, I mean, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3193.7799999999997s)]
*  the first time I met him and he said, where are you from? I said, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3197.94s)]
*  McAllen, Texas on the border. His next question was, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3200.86s)]
*  how much can you get a kilo of cocaine for? And I went, well, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3203.46s)]
*  if we were needing predication, I think he just gave it. Uh, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3207.14s)]
*  but his business skills weren't that great. Cause I'd say, look, man, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3211.14s)]
*  about 13 grands, which you could get a kilo for then on the border. He said, man, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3213.58s)]
*  so if I got 10 of them up here for 13, I'm like, no, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3217.3s)]
*  that's not gonna cost 13 up here. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3219.5s)]
*  There's a reason the kilo cost 25 to 30 grand up here because somebody has to [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3221.62s)]
*  get it from the border to here. Now, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3225.86s)]
*  if you want to drive down the border and buy 10 for 13 a piece and you risk [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3228.78s)]
*  taking them back over. But, um, so we let it be known, uh, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3232.78s)]
*  that, that I had some car to, of course they knew I had cartel contacts. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3237.54s)]
*  And we started introducing those, some cameo undercovers came in, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3241.78s)]
*  unbelievable people. Um, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3245.26s)]
*  and we ended up doing what some refer to as a drug protection. Uh, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3247.3s)]
*  there was going to be a drug shipment coming in and my crew was going to be [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3251.86s)]
*  delivering it to another crew and we needed protection and we did it in [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3255.14s)]
*  Brockton. Um, and several outlaws hopped in on it. Uh, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3259.1s)]
*  the issue was this, at least one of the big issues, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3264.02s)]
*  pretty much that case I had a great time. Yes, it's violent. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3267.62s)]
*  And my, my mentality was changing. There is a podcast that's a, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3270.14s)]
*  it's a series that's going to be coming out, um, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3274.8199999999997s)]
*  with the book and they actually interview one of the, uh, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3278.2599999999998s)]
*  task force officers who was over me on that case and the outlaws. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3282.5s)]
*  And I remember him calling me. He's like, Hey, what say, what can I say? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3286.02s)]
*  I said, tell them the truth. I said, I want to know, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3288.7s)]
*  I want to know what you were thinking. I know what I was thinking. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3290.26s)]
*  And it was really, really surreal to hear him talking about. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3292.62s)]
*  He could see my personality changing. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3296.38s)]
*  He could see in like the FBI office might be saying we want him to patch. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3298.58s)]
*  And he was over here fighting going, hell no, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3302.62s)]
*  we're getting everything we need now. If he patches, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3304.54s)]
*  then they can order him to do shit. And it was just really cool to hear that. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3306.42s)]
*  But, uh, essentially for the case, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3310.3s)]
*  it was me and FBI case agent and two task force officers. Uh, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3312.66s)]
*  we had, uh, detective Joe Cummings from Brockton PD, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3317.06s)]
*  Sergeant Higginbottom from the Massachusetts state troopers, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3320.62s)]
*  and then an agent with the FBI. And that was it. I mean, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3323.7s)]
*  they would add some here and there, but for two years that was it. It was us. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3325.94s)]
*  So now we get to this point to where we're like, man, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3328.9s)]
*  let's do this drug protection. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3331.26s)]
*  And the assistant United States attorney was like, Hey, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3333.3s)]
*  if you're going to be at the clubhouse or did they talk about this at the clubhouse? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3336.3s)]
*  Yeah. And he goes, well, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3339.54s)]
*  that'd be awesome if we could get that recorded because it helps right to show [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3340.38s)]
*  what they're planning on doing. Um, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3344.26s)]
*  so the night before the deal is supposed to happen, they don't know it, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3347.34s)]
*  but we've got 40 kilos of real cocaine and a thousand pounds of weed real. Um, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3351.66s)]
*  so you can imagine SWAT teams are involved because I mean, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3356.42s)]
*  can you imagine if the FBI lost 40 kilos of cocaine and [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3359.82s)]
*  Brockton and Tauntons are all wide awake for the next week, you know, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3365.14s)]
*  or there's ODs, you know, cause that's a liability. Um, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3368.94s)]
*  did you say you had 40 kilos? There's only 39 here. Hmm. I don't know. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3373.54s)]
*  But, uh, so they say, Hey, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3379.06s)]
*  Joe dogs calls me it's not a church. He says, Hey, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3383.86s)]
*  I need you to come to the clubhouse. I'm like, all right, cool. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3386.38s)]
*  And of course I'm thinking I'm Taipei. I'm Scott paying. I got this. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3389.3s)]
*  Let's go do this, man. These are my boys. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3392.66s)]
*  I've been doing this a year and a half and I went into the clubhouse and what I [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3394.14s)]
*  couldn't see, and I won't say where the recording devices were at because that's [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3398.74s)]
*  trade craft. Um, but let's just say I had a video and recording device hidden [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3401.74s)]
*  somewhere in my clothing. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3406.4599999999996s)]
*  I had a completely audio recording device somewhere else on me and I had a [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3408.22s)]
*  transmitter batteries that so the team could listen in. Um, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3412.8999999999996s)]
*  and I went into the clubhouse like normal, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3417.14s)]
*  but what you can't see if you go back and you watch the video is if I'm facing [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3419.8199999999997s)]
*  this way and I'm shooting the shit with you and this is the bar and you're [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3424.4199999999996s)]
*  laughing at my jokes, like always, when I would turn my head to look this way, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3427.98s)]
*  it's still filming and I didn't see it cause I turned my head, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3433.22s)]
*  they go stone face and I missed it. I didn't see it. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3436.42s)]
*  Um, I do know that when I got to the clubhouse, I knock on the door, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3442.02s)]
*  knock on the door, I'm knocking on the door. I'm like, what the f you know, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3445.02s)]
*  Joe dogs prophecy cause they, hey, we're not ready yet. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3447.14s)]
*  And I'll give them why the hell did you tell me to come? I was being a smart. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3449.34s)]
*  I'm like, what's the deal? I was just say, come if you're not ready. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3452.06s)]
*  I didn't pick anything up. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3455.42s)]
*  So I go in and for the listeners, uh, that may not know, uh, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3458.02s)]
*  at least in this clubhouse, if you're not a patch member, which I wasn't, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3462.14s)]
*  they offered it several times. They wanted me to patch, but I, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3465.74s)]
*  I'm with the, what I said for the task force officer. I said the same thing. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3469.46s)]
*  I'm like, look, if I'm a probate and they say, get your shit text, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3472.9s)]
*  we're going to go check this dude. I kind of got to go. I mean, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3477.02s)]
*  if I don't do it, I'm either getting kicked out or beat down or whatever. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3480.62s)]
*  Um, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3484.02s)]
*  but being a high ranking member of an international theft ring that they're [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3484.86s)]
*  making money off of, so a little different. We were getting everything we wanted. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3488.58s)]
*  So I go into the clubhouse. I miss that. I also missed it in the back. Uh, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3492.5s)]
*  one of them chocolate Scott, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3497.1s)]
*  it looks like he's dancing to the song that's playing, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3498.98s)]
*  but he's warming up and I miss that. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3501.7400000000002s)]
*  And then my second closest contact clothes line says, Hey Tex, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3503.98s)]
*  you got a minute? And I said, yeah. And we walk, I'd been in that clubhouse. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3507.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know how many times Joe, but there's one door I'd never been in. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3512.22s)]
*  And that's the door we went in. And it was a very tight stairwell into, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3516.8599999999997s)]
*  you can say a basement, but that's being very, uh, that's, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3520.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm stretching it because I could probably touch the ball wall on both sides. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3524.54s)]
*  And I couldn't stand up straight. So they bring me down in there. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3527.8599999999997s)]
*  They've brandished their weapons. One of them walks in behind me. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3530.6s)]
*  He's on the steps. So they got their pistols and, uh, my friend says, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3533.22s)]
*  Hey, there's a lot of shit going on. It's my job to take care of my brothers. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3538.68s)]
*  I need you to write down your full name, your address, your phone number, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3542.3799999999997s)]
*  all kinds of stuff. Uh, and I need you to take off all your clothes. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3546.8999999999996s)]
*  I need to check you for a wire. Here's the problem. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3550.4599999999996s)]
*  Had I not been wired embarrassing? Yes. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3554.7799999999997s)]
*  Naked with a bunch of men around you in a cold basement. Yeah, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3557.4599999999996s)]
*  that would have been bad, but it would have been no threat. Um, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3562.4599999999996s)]
*  but I was wired to the hilt. And so you think, man, do you fight? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3567.02s)]
*  Do you try to get out? Well, there's already two or three there. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3571.42s)]
*  I'm probably going to do some Tommy boy shit and knock myself out on the joist [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3574.58s)]
*  as soon as I start trying to fight. And then upstairs, there's what? [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3577.98s)]
*  10 more outlaws and that door, what I was getting to do earlier, I didn't say, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3580.82s)]
*  uh, if you're not a patch member, you can't touch the door. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3585.7400000000002s)]
*  That door has more than one deadbolt on it. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3588.34s)]
*  They had welded metal hooks to the frame and put one of those like shipyard [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3590.78s)]
*  metal bars across. So from a breacher standpoint, it's a fortified door. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3594.34s)]
*  It might be easier to breach the wall next to it. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3598.98s)]
*  So we're down there in the basement. And when I go to write my name down, um, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3602.42s)]
*  I forgot my middle name and that's because I was having a no crap moment. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3607.86s)]
*  I had an adrenaline dump. Same thing as cops and shootouts, uh, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3611.06s)]
*  military and shoot out somebody in a car wreck. First time, everything, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3614.7400000000002s)]
*  when you're having that adrenaline dump, everything slows down. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3618.14s)]
*  You get auditory exclusion. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3621.66s)]
*  So everything you're hearing sounds like you're underwater is going to whoosh, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3623.02s)]
*  whoosh is slow. Like you're talking to me like this time dilation, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3626.1800000000003s)]
*  your eyes are clicking, you look and everything's in frames. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3631.02s)]
*  Everything's slowing down. Your hamstrings get really rubbery. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3634.54s)]
*  You feel your heart beating. I mean, do you feel everything? Poulson? Um, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3637.6200000000003s)]
*  and what seems like 10, 15 minutes is probably 30 seconds. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3641.98s)]
*  And that happens. That's an adrenaline dump. So that was happening. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3646.6200000000003s)]
*  And I forgot my middle name and I'm going to Scott Callaway, Scott Callaway, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3650.54s)]
*  Scott Callaway. I'll start going through this damn Rolodex in my head and I'm [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3653.9s)]
*  going, oh, Scott Callaway, Scott Callaway. And I'm going Scott Joseph. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3656.34s)]
*  I got, not damn it. That was a middle. That was my middle name for another alias, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3658.9799999999996s)]
*  you know? And I don't realize that, uh, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3661.8599999999997s)]
*  I do a distraction technique or something to try to get more intelligence. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3666.2999999999997s)]
*  I would have never known. I said it would have never agreed. I said, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3670.3799999999997s)]
*  had I not seen it in the recording, but I turned and I go, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3674.14s)]
*  and what else do you need? And by the way, you've got a baseline of me now, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3677.02s)]
*  my voice, it did not sound like this on that recording. My throat was tight. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3680.18s)]
*  The octaves, I mean, it was very higher than normal. And I'm like, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3684.7799999999997s)]
*  not even enunciating that well. I'm like, what else do you need? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3688.62s)]
*  And they're like, what? I go, my name and what else? Well, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3692.2999999999997s)]
*  now I hear them scream up and they go, what else do you need for that website? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3694.8199999999997s)]
*  So now I know, oh, are they going to Google me? Back then there was, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3698.2599999999998s)]
*  who's a rat.com, things like that. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3701.2599999999998s)]
*  So I'm gathering that evidence or intelligence. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3704.58s)]
*  And then I remember my middle name was, uh, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3706.94s)]
*  my initials were SAC cause I'm an idiot and I thought it was funny cause I [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3709.14s)]
*  shoot the SAC is the head of an FBI division and I knew I was never going to be [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3712.14s)]
*  one. So, so I made my initials SAC. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3715.3799999999997s)]
*  So I remember my name's Scott Andrew Callaway and then I write that down. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3718.54s)]
*  Well now I take off all my clothes. I take off my, my, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3722.62s)]
*  my outer clothing, all my shirts. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3725.2599999999998s)]
*  I take my boots off and I'll basically pull my underwear and jeans down around my [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3727.62s)]
*  ankles. Um, so pretty much naked from, I mean, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3731.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm definitely naked from ankles up and he starts searching me. And I'm, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3735.3799999999997s)]
*  again, I'm having an oh shit moment and he's, he's trying to talk to me and, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3740.3399999999997s)]
*  and he's like, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3745.2999999999997s)]
*  like we had known each other for a year and a half. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3748.14s)]
*  So I'm not saying it out loud, but if you saw what my face was saying, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3750.7s)]
*  what my face is saying and asking is tell me I'm okay. Is this okay? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3754.8999999999996s)]
*  Well clothesline because we were tight hits me back with a face look. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3760.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like everything's all right. This is just procedure. However, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3764.4599999999996s)]
*  he didn't know that I'm an undercover agent and I'm wired. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3767.7799999999997s)]
*  So that adds a whole nother issue. So he searches me. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3770.5s)]
*  Um, he had been one point he even tells me, he says, uh, trust me, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3775.02s)]
*  if somebody accused me of being a fed, I'd probably smash them the fucking mouth. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3778.34s)]
*  And I said, those are his words. And I immediately said, well, I'm not happy. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3782.14s)]
*  I'll tell you what I did do. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3786.7799999999997s)]
*  I did look to make sure there was no plastic on the floor and I've had people [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3787.9s)]
*  ask me, what does that mean? And I go, well, listen, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3791.3s)]
*  if you're in the criminal underbelly of society and there's plastic on the [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3793.18s)]
*  floor and they're telling you to walk on it, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3796.1s)]
*  yeah, you get to clean up the blood. I didn't see that. I saw a rope. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3798.86s)]
*  I saw pistols and I knew I didn't have a chance on hell of getting out of there [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3803.38s)]
*  and one piece. So [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3808.3s)]
*  he finishes and he's saying something. He goes, he goes, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3812.7400000000002s)]
*  wouldn't you be suspect if somebody comes to your town and starts doing all this [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3816.34s)]
*  shit with you? I said, yeah, if you came to me, I didn't come to you guys. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3820.34s)]
*  Y'all called me over. Nobody has to do this shit. I'm like, what do we, you know, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3824.46s)]
*  nobody has to do anything. Right. And I think we're done. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3830.06s)]
*  So I pull my pants back up and I think we're done. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3833.98s)]
*  And he grabs a piece of clothing of mine and he starts needing it and going [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3837.2599999999998s)]
*  through it. Now this is 2005 to 2007 ish. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3841.5s)]
*  So tech technology today is way better than it was then just like technology is, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3846.46s)]
*  but let's just say this, had he done this down my entire piece of clothing, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3851.3399999999997s)]
*  he would have felt something. And he says as a joke, when he starts, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3856.1s)]
*  he goes, Hey, I'm not going to find anything in here. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3861.1s)]
*  I don't want to like some naked pictures of my old lady. And he laughs. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3864.14s)]
*  And his laugh is like, and my laugh is like, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3867.7799999999997s)]
*  and then I'm watching him go down this piece of clothing and he's doing this and [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3872.74s)]
*  he's needing it. And, and I, you can hear, again, I don't know how to do it, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3877.54s)]
*  but on the recording, you can hear me go, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3881.74s)]
*  uh, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3886.1s)]
*  an audible sigh because I'm like watching it and I'm going, what the f what am I [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3887.94s)]
*  going to do? So here's how it ends. He doesn't find it. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3892.14s)]
*  Wow. Almost. I mean like very, very close. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3897.8199999999997s)]
*  And by the way, that first adrenaline dump, I've come back up and now I've got [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3903.94s)]
*  another adrenaline dump and now I've come in. I'm like, son of a bitch, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3906.98s)]
*  you know, speaks in valleys and uh, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3909.42s)]
*  everybody that I've taught this to or spoke about it to always ask, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3912.38s)]
*  they're like, man, what would you have said? And I'll tell you, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3916.86s)]
*  I had two responses because I'm a jovial idiot. My first response, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3919.7s)]
*  if he would have said, what is this? I would have probably said, I don't know, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3923.86s)]
*  some naked pictures of the old lady to try to buy myself some time, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3927.14s)]
*  maybe make him quit searching. The only, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3930.3s)]
*  the other thing I had Joe is, and I remember it like it was yesterday, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3932.46s)]
*  I would have said the gig is up. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3935.86s)]
*  I'm an undercover FBI agent and I can walk out of here and we can see each other [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3937.94s)]
*  in court or all hell's going to break loose. Here's the issue. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3941.62s)]
*  As I get a swig [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3946.02s)]
*  that would have been a bluff on my part because as far as I knew, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3950.66s)]
*  every time I was in that clubhouse, my cover team could never hear me [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3954.66s)]
*  for whatever reasons, because somebody's going to say it's trade craft. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3959.74s)]
*  But again, this is 2005 to 2008, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3962.7799999999997s)]
*  but they could never really hear me in that clubhouse. And [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3965.22s)]
*  I make it out. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3969.54s)]
*  I ended up going out with Scott Town and Joe dogs at night. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3971.78s)]
*  But what happens is I am legitimately pissed off because now my adrenaline's [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3975.06s)]
*  coming back down and I'm, I'm taking it personal. I shouldn't. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3979.34s)]
*  I'm undercover as an FBI agent. I'm not really Scott Calloway. I'm kind of, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3983.98s)]
*  but you're so deep in the role. Well, and it's really me kind of, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3987.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean that's the whole thing. I never was far off of who I really am in life. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3990.38s)]
*  Right. A pedophile. Yeah. You're hiring me to kill somebody. No, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3994.06s)]
*  I'm not going to ingratiate with you. I'm a stone cold killer, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=3997.38s)]
*  but I'm hanging with you for two years or a year and a half or whatever. Yeah. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4001.26s)]
*  The jokes are kind of the same. So, so I'm pissed. And I'm at, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4005.86s)]
*  at one point I'm telling Joe dogs, I'm like, you know what, man, F all you sons. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4010.2200000000003s)]
*  I said, y'all show up tomorrow. I said, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4013.58s)]
*  I'm stripping all y'all in the damn parking lot. You know, I was just, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4014.98s)]
*  boy, they were nice. They let me vent my stuff. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4017.06s)]
*  Well that night when I went to turn in my equipment, uh, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4021.5s)]
*  in an undisclosed location, probably three, four or five in the morning to the [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4024.74s)]
*  case team. Um, what I found out was this, uh, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4028.3399999999997s)]
*  the shift started with Sergeant Higginbottom. Everybody caught him Higgy, uh, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4033.3399999999997s)]
*  and Joe, the detectives, I'd be detective. Uh, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4037.18s)]
*  these guys are awesome. Phenomenal law enforcement officers. Uh, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4041.1s)]
*  although I think their love language is yelling, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4046.02s)]
*  maybe that's my Southern thing mixing with the Northeast thing, but uh, uh, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4050.8999999999996s)]
*  they told me, they said, Scott, we heard you in there. And I'm like, what? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4055.14s)]
*  When I had that first interaction with Joe dogs, they are very street smart. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4059.54s)]
*  They're very good investigators and they had been working this group for ever. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4064.2999999999997s)]
*  Something that happened in that first interaction made their spotty senses or [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4068.58s)]
*  the Holy spirit. If you're a believer, uh, say something's not right. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4071.8799999999997s)]
*  They had pulled close enough. They heard everything. They put on their vest, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4076.5s)]
*  they suited up. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4081.06s)]
*  And because they'd been in that clubhouse before and knew that door system, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4081.94s)]
*  their plan was to drive the van into the cinder block wall next to the door. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4085.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. Just to smash that, you know, uh, sometimes I'm teaching this. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4090.46s)]
*  I'll joke about it and say, it probably would have killed me cause I was in the [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4094.26s)]
*  basement, you know, reverse back up. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4096.3s)]
*  You're so damn heavy. But, um, at that moment I was scared to death, right? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4101.26s)]
*  So they tell me what happened was they pulled close enough. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4105.7s)]
*  They heard everything. They're suiting up. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4110.54s)]
*  They have radioed now cause it's kind of the beginning of the shift. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4112.5s)]
*  They've radioed now back to Boston. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4115.38s)]
*  Everybody that's working that night is now blue license siren all the way down to [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4117.3s)]
*  hauling ass to Taunton, Massachusetts. So, uh, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4121.06s)]
*  I say this in a jovial way, but the case agent was actually a good friend of mine. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4124.1s)]
*  We went through the FBI academy together and, uh, that night, um, again, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4127.7s)]
*  I'm still shell shocked. He says, man, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4132.34s)]
*  when I was coming down the highway with my blue license sirens on, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4134.42s)]
*  I felt like I was in there with you. And I looked at him and I said, you weren't, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4137.660000000001s)]
*  I said, cause I was looking for any friendly face I could find and that's damn [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4145.1s)]
*  whole. But, uh, so, uh, that night, um, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4149.38s)]
*  we haven't talked about my family. I try not. Well, I'll take it back. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4154.38s)]
*  In the book I'm very transparent about where things went south with the family, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4157.700000000001s)]
*  where my marriage almost ended, you know, nine one, one hangups, stuff like that. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4162.26s)]
*  But at that point in time, uh, I'd bought my wife, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4166.82s)]
*  everybody's pretty familiar now with the burner phone, but I'd bought my wife, uh, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4169.82s)]
*  a phone that came back to nothing. So my undercover phone could call that phone, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4173.66s)]
*  not violating the operational security that night. Joe, when I called her, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4177.5s)]
*  I'd always call her every night. And again, five, seven in the morning, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4182.54s)]
*  didn't matter. And it might just be, she wakes up and says, hello. And I go, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4185.66s)]
*  Hey, I just want you to know I'm done heading back to the hotel room. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4188.82s)]
*  Whenever I wake up this afternoon, I'll call you. It might be that quick. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4191.38s)]
*  That night when I called her, um, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4195.06s)]
*  the first thing she said to me was, are you okay? And I said, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4197.7s)]
*  I said, yeah, why? And she said, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4202.5s)]
*  I was driving with our daughters at such and such time in McAllen. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4204.62s)]
*  And she said she got this overwhelming feeling and pulled over on the side of [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4208.74s)]
*  the road and started praying for me. And I matched it up. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4212.38s)]
*  That's when I was in the basement. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4214.9400000000005s)]
*  So say what you will, but, uh, damn. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4217.900000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4223.06s)]
*  Yeah. Apparently my shit signal. Apparently I don't need Verizon or anything. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4223.74s)]
*  Cause it went from Boston all the way to the bottom of Texas, but it's just, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4229.3s)]
*  uh, I mean that that's just one of the little, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4233.46s)]
*  one of the things that happened and it just takes a toll on you over time. Um, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4236.66s)]
*  I can only imagine. Yeah. So I'll get you to the next day. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4241.3s)]
*  We do the deal. Clothesline doesn't show up. Well, that pisses me off. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4245.46s)]
*  Wait a minute. You supposed to be my boy. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4250.66s)]
*  And you took me into the damn basement and stripped me at gunpoint, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4252.9s)]
*  but you can't come up. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4256.66s)]
*  You don't show up the next day and help with this thing again. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4257.58s)]
*  I'm taking it personal. I shouldn't. So everybody knew there was a beef. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4260.78s)]
*  Let's just fast forward a month or two. I go back home. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4265.219999999999s)]
*  I come back and big Scotty had even said, he goes, look, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4267.98s)]
*  these guys are going to settle this like grown men face to face. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4271.099999999999s)]
*  It ain't going to happen over the damn phone. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4273.299999999999s)]
*  So the next time I go back to Massachusetts, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4274.82s)]
*  I'm at a Cantina. We used to go hang it and drink it and bridge water and, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4279.38s)]
*  another hard town. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so, uh, these are my people. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4284.74s)]
*  This is where I get called. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4289.42s)]
*  We did not do any meetings at the long wharf Marriott. You know what I mean? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4291.66s)]
*  Ah, why would you like to meet me at legal seafoods tonight? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4296.54s)]
*  My fellow criminals, you know? Yeah. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4299.54s)]
*  Uh, so, uh, so I'm at this Cantina and clothesline walks in. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4303.26s)]
*  Now you gotta remember the last time I saw this dude, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4309.14s)]
*  he took me into a damn basement and he looked a little rough, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4311.06s)]
*  like a little whipped, you know, like he'd been disheveled. And he says, Hey man, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4315.38s)]
*  can I talk to you for a minute? And the first thing I said was no. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4320.7s)]
*  And he says, why? I said, cause the last time you asked me that shit, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4324.42s)]
*  I ended up naked in the basement. No. So he says, I was like that. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4326.66s)]
*  So we went back in the kitchen and we're talking and what we learned or what I [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4331.06s)]
*  learned in the case team learned is when we up the ante to do that drug deal. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4335.9800000000005s)]
*  Um, and again, a lot of those outlaws were pushing for it because as a drug [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4341.660000000001s)]
*  dealer, what are you always looking for? Cheaper product, higher quality. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4344.42s)]
*  That's just more money for you. Right? So he was really, especially Joe dog. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4348.34s)]
*  They wanted to get a pipeline. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4352.3s)]
*  They wanted to get an introduction to the cartel so they could get quality dope, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4353.54s)]
*  you know, and, and have a, have a very successful business. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4357.620000000001s)]
*  Um, so I'm in there with him and I'm ready. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4361.02s)]
*  I'm ready to go to blows if we have to. And he starts talking to me and he says, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4365.34s)]
*  you know, Scott, he said, um, what had happened? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4370.9800000000005s)]
*  Well I was going to tell you is that the call went up to the top in the top to [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4373.78s)]
*  us meant Milwaukee Jack was the national president. Uh, and this, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4377.82s)]
*  this makes a hard argument for when they say it's not an organization. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4381.78s)]
*  You do your own stuff. We only DM in each other. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4385.54s)]
*  Nobody knows each other's business. Well then how did it go to the top of the [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4388.34s)]
*  outlaws who said, has this guy ever really been checked? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4391.66s)]
*  And they go back and say, well, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4394.9400000000005s)]
*  we've done like six to eight jobs with him and we're not in bracelets, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4396.54s)]
*  meaning handcuffs. And he said, I don't care. Check them. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4399.14s)]
*  So now that's when I get stripped in the basement. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4402.18s)]
*  I learned that and this is what clothes line tells me. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4406.06s)]
*  And you gotta remember my mindset is screw this guy. I'm ready to go to blows. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4410.26s)]
*  I'm not going to look like a bitch. And he says, man, um, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4413.74s)]
*  I know I was born to be an outlaw. I'm either going to die young or die in jail. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4418.42s)]
*  He said, and these are my brothers. He said, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4422.900000000001s)]
*  but I really don't have a lot of friends. And he said, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4424.92s)]
*  ones that I know would take a bullet for me and I'd take a bullet for them. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4427.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's when I started looking at his face and I'm going, Oh shit, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4432.34s)]
*  don't you say it, man, don't you say it? And he says, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4435.22s)]
*  and you're one of those people. So now I'm like, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4439.46s)]
*  and he says the reason he didn't show up is because he felt so bad. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4443.82s)]
*  For what he had to do to me in the basement that night. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4448.66s)]
*  He got so obliterated that night. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4451.14s)]
*  He was passed out through the whole drug deal the next day. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4453.9800000000005s)]
*  So that night when I called my wife, she says, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4458.82s)]
*  hello. And my first words are, or she's like, how's it going? How did it go? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4463.02s)]
*  My first words are, I am a dick. I go, I am such a dick. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4467.58s)]
*  This guy loves me. He cares about me. Now that's the real side. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4471.900000000001s)]
*  That's the human side. Now there might be, you know, we don't train that way. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4477.179999999999s)]
*  We tell you, look, that's not you, but I'm still human. I'm out there. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4481.179999999999s)]
*  I'm out there. I'm surprised we hadn't said this yet. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4484.139999999999s)]
*  A lot of times if I'm speaking or teaching or whatever, I'll put up there, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4488.74s)]
*  what does undercover mean to you? So I'll ask you, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4491.9s)]
*  what do you think undercover is? You're pretending. Okay. You're pretending. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4494.139999999999s)]
*  You infiltrate an organization, pretend to be one of them. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4497.94s)]
*  I get that a lot. I get lying. We hear acting. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4502.219999999999s)]
*  You're a character. Here is the definition of undercover work. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4507.42s)]
*  You are building relationships that you're going to betray. And that sucks. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4512.46s)]
*  If you look at it that way, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4517.62s)]
*  especially if you genuinely have something in common with these guys, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4518.9s)]
*  and you actually like their company. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4522.339999999999s)]
*  Now don't get me wrong. If you haven't done anything illegal, well then no, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4524.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm really not. I mean, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4527.9s)]
*  I guess I'm still betraying you because you thought I was somebody else, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4528.62s)]
*  but we're not arresting you. I've done undercovers like that. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4531.099999999999s)]
*  There's those that happen all the time. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4533.58s)]
*  You're in there for five months and you're like, there's nothing federal here. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4534.66s)]
*  I mean, they're just, they're there within their constitutional rights. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4537.0599999999995s)]
*  And you just bail. But, uh, you, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4540.62s)]
*  you have to, you are basically building and betraying relationships, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4545.0599999999995s)]
*  especially if you're gathering evidence of criminal activity. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4549.74s)]
*  And you need to know how you're going to deal with that. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4552.099999999999s)]
*  Rationalize that in your mind so it doesn't have an adverse impact on your [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4554.0599999999995s)]
*  psyche. And that's, that's tough. You know, uh, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4558.0s)]
*  I'll fast forward you a little bit. I, I, I, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4562.74s)]
*  I crashed on that case for the three year period. Um, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4564.78s)]
*  I'd been going nonstop and I'm not saying I'm tough. Uh, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4568.54s)]
*  I met my threshold. I think your threshold changes every day, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4572.900000000001s)]
*  just like your comfort zone. Some days I take off jogging at 54 years old. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4576.26s)]
*  Sometimes I take off running and I go, it's going to be a damn good day. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4580.62s)]
*  I feel like fluffy floating on the floating on the cloud. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4583.7s)]
*  Some days I take off running and I go, how long have I been running? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4587.38s)]
*  Two minutes. Damn, it's going to be a long day. You know, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4590.46s)]
*  so your comfort zone changes, I think your threshold changes, but, uh, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4594.5s)]
*  I go into great detail in the book, but, uh, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4598.780000000001s)]
*  for three years I had been doing too much. Um, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4603.06s)]
*  well I say doing too much, but even when I moved to Tennessee, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4608.34s)]
*  I did too much again. I just learned how to balance it better. I, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4612.14s)]
*  I'm a workaholic. I love working. I love doing it all. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4615.580000000001s)]
*  Swat call outs, running tactical schools here, case agent first, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4618.1s)]
*  building cases, putting bad people in jail undercover. Um, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4622.14s)]
*  but I had stopped taking days off because I didn't want to give management a [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4627.5s)]
*  reason to tell me I couldn't go do an undercover. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4631.740000000001s)]
*  I just worked through the weekend or be undercover through the weekend, come back, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4634.06s)]
*  type up all my stuff, then run my cases. Um, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4637.700000000001s)]
*  teaching all the tactics and firearms for McAllen and Brownsville agents, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4640.46s)]
*  uh, resident, resident agents, which is just a satellite offices, uh, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4645.74s)]
*  out of San Antonio on squat, running firearms for them, stuff like that. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4649.06s)]
*  And I just stopped taking care of myself. So we get to a point to where, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4653.74s)]
*  uh, like I said, in great detail in the book, but just picture this, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4659.22s)]
*  I already give you a little bit of a blurb on the undercover school, right? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4661.9800000000005s)]
*  Two weeks, no days off. Let's just say I'm there for 10 days. Well, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4664.860000000001s)]
*  once we put you to bed, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4669.18s)]
*  we're probably going to hang out and drink a little bit because you're my peer. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4670.900000000001s)]
*  And it's also therapy. And I haven't made, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4673.94s)]
*  it's good to know that you're not on an Island by yourself, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4676.5s)]
*  that there are other people doing the same thing you are. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4679.18s)]
*  And there's a lot of bonding that goes on there. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4681.42s)]
*  But that means for 10 days, I'm not getting a whole lot of sleep. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4684.06s)]
*  And I'm probably got too much alcohol in my system. If we're being transparent, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4687.0199999999995s)]
*  but then I'll leave straight from that undercover school and I go right into an [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4692.14s)]
*  undercover. And let's just say I land in Sturgis, which I did. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4695.42s)]
*  And the hell's angels shoot five outlaws at point blank range. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4699.38s)]
*  My first day there, like I hadn't even been in town like an hour. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4702.46s)]
*  Now there's two old ladies, two patch members and a probate, but they're all shot. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4705.46s)]
*  They confirmed it was hell's angels. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4709.62s)]
*  We're talking paralyzed from the waist down for life. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4711.1s)]
*  We're talking shot, crushed clavicles. I mean, not just like a zinger. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4713.82s)]
*  And now you're back doing that for days on end. And when I would get home, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4718.86s)]
*  I would stop taking care of myself. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4723.78s)]
*  I got to the point to where I was a walking zombie. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4725.78s)]
*  Um, I was on antihistamines, decongestants, inhalers. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4728.7s)]
*  I was taking hydroxy cuts like crazy. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4733.02s)]
*  I was making the strongest coffee I could possibly make. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4734.9800000000005s)]
*  And I'd drink a pot of coffee and fall asleep. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4739.1s)]
*  So what I learned through the book process, even though I'd learned a lot already, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4742.3s)]
*  I found out from my wife, I was a ghost, man. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4747.14s)]
*  I'd come home from SWAT work undercover, whatever. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4749.62s)]
*  I'd be on the couch and my daughters would be on my lap. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4754.1s)]
*  I'd help put them to bed, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4756.86s)]
*  but my wife couldn't even ask me a simple question about the bills. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4758.42s)]
*  You know, Hey, there's this bill I got, do whatever you got. I can't think. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4763.42s)]
*  I just need to, and she wanted to do everything she could to support me and just [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4766.86s)]
*  let me veg and not putting anything on my plate. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4770.5s)]
*  So we get to the end of the outlaw case and I'm starting to crash. Um, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4774.34s)]
*  didn't know it. Uh, if you are a certified undercover and you were active in the [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4779.02s)]
*  FBI, you mandatorily have to be psychologically assessed twice a year. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4784.38s)]
*  Um, that whole thing is called safeguard. I'm not outing anything. It's out there. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4790.46s)]
*  It's on the internet. Um, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4794.42s)]
*  but the safeguard process was created by Joe Pistone down in Nebraska. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4796.14s)]
*  It was created by Joe and a, and a former agent who was about his background was [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4801.22s)]
*  a clinical psychologist, Steve band. And they came up with this because Joe, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4805.9800000000005s)]
*  you gotta remember when Joe was undercover, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4810.580000000001s)]
*  there was no attorney general guidelines. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4812.1s)]
*  There was probably wouldn't even an operational procedure manual for [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4813.900000000001s)]
*  undercovers. It was like, here's money. Here's your recorders. Go make a case. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4817.46s)]
*  He was one of the first 25 undercovers in the FBI in 1972. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4822.02s)]
*  That happened right after Hoover left. Hoover did not believe in the undercover [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4826.740000000001s)]
*  technique, but soon as he was out, they started working undercover. Um, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4830.18s)]
*  but the safeguard process goes like you take a bunch of psychological set test, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4834.900000000001s)]
*  and then you're going to sit down, you're gonna take a break. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4839.14s)]
*  It's going to put a bunch of numbers into some charts. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4841.46s)]
*  You're going to sit down with the clinical psychologist. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4843.62s)]
*  They may be an agent for the FBI or they may be contracted in. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4845.42s)]
*  They're going to go over all that stuff with you. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4848.14s)]
*  They're going to dive deep into your psyche. Try to. Uh, and then after that, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4849.66s)]
*  you're going to sit down with somebody like a Pistone or an experienced [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4853.66s)]
*  undercover. Cause you know, the old saying, you can't bullshit a bullshitter. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4857.02s)]
*  Well, we use undercover UC as a verb. You can't UC a UC. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4860.820000000001s)]
*  So I remember going to take one of the tests is an open ended sentence. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4866.22s)]
*  You have to fill in the blanks. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4870.42s)]
*  So I'm on my way to Daytona at a world run with the outlaws, uh, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4871.54s)]
*  still rolling heavy in the case. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4876.14s)]
*  And I stopped off at an undisclosed location to do the assessment. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4878.02s)]
*  And I remember like the open ended sentence is not be men are, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4883.1s)]
*  and you got to finish it. I'd always say men, women are, I put women, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4887.66s)]
*  they'd be like, what do you mean? I go, you know what I mean? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4892.5s)]
*  That's I'm not opening that can of worms. No, we're different. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4894.66s)]
*  How's that? Um, but there was one that said the last time I relaxed, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4899.54s)]
*  I and I couldn't think anything. Wow. Nothing. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4903.3s)]
*  And that's not me BSing. I'm like sitting there at the table going, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4907.34s)]
*  well, I work out all the time. I'm like, but that's not relaxing. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4911.7s)]
*  It's not like I'm Namaste and listen to Yanni and shit. I'm like, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4914.66s)]
*  I'm trying to throw 45s across the gym, you know? Um, but I'm like, [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4917.74s)]
*  Hmm. So I just made up a story. Even, even at that moment, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4922.62s)]
*  I thought that that's really screwed up. Wow. But I was like, yeah, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4925.5s)]
*  well, it ain't a big deal. And, uh, again, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4929.62s)]
*  way more detail in the book. But the thing that, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4934.14s)]
*  the thing that happened to me was, uh, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4936.06s)]
*  I ended up out and out partying without laws and mongols all night. Um, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4938.54s)]
*  we, uh, I wake up the next morning. I mean, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4943.7s)]
*  you can hear and feel the whiskey and eggs squishing in your belly, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4946.3s)]
*  you know that, you know, and I'm like, I'm, I've just feel disgusted. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4949.64s)]
*  I'm going to start working out. So I'm in the hotel room doing, uh, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4953.86s)]
*  before P90 came out, but kind of that thing, burpees, mountain climbers, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4957.54s)]
*  pushups, air squats, sit ups, all this stuff. And I came up and by the way, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4960.860000000001s)]
*  this is after I hit the inhaler, took a decongestant and histamine, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4965.66s)]
*  three hydroxy cuts, two cups of coffee. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4969.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know if there was anything else in there. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4972.64s)]
*  I later learned that that was basically a cocktail for an anxiety attack. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4974.780000000001s)]
*  I was like, who knew? Ah, that doesn't make a lot of sense, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4979.06s)]
*  but I had, I had an anxiety attack. I was trying to work out. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4983.02s)]
*  I came up for air hyperventilated, forgot all about combat breathing, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4985.22s)]
*  forgot about paper bags. And, uh, but did I stop? Did I say, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4988.820000000001s)]
*  man, that's really screwed up? No. I took a nap, got up, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4993.780000000001s)]
*  started drinking Jack Daniels and went back. But when I flew home, uh, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=4997.900000000001s)]
*  I slept wheels up to wheels down till I hit Houston. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5003.38s)]
*  And then I slept wheels up to wheels down until I got to McAllen. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5007.38s)]
*  And I think probably the first two days I might've slept close to 20 hours. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5010.62s)]
*  A day. Um, but for the whole week, for a five, from like Sunday to Friday, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5015.02s)]
*  I slept an average of 16 plus hours a day. Wow. And I wasn't, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5019.78s)]
*  I wasn't depressed. I wasn't sick. I know what they both feel like. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5024.82s)]
*  I was that damn tired. Um, so by Friday morning, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5028.82s)]
*  I take a phone call from a former good buddy of mine. Um, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5032.26s)]
*  he has probably one of the best undercovers I've ever seen. Uh, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5036.3s)]
*  but he was calling me about a possible another biker case. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5039.68s)]
*  And his first question was, how you doing country? And I'm like, not too good. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5042.5s)]
*  And then he let me talk for an hour and convinced myself I needed to call [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5047.18s)]
*  safeguard. So I called them. They came in and did an onsite assessment. They, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5051.08s)]
*  uh, diagnosed me as overassigned and they said, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5055.9800000000005s)]
*  you can continue the case on the phone until they take it down. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5059.3s)]
*  And I stayed on the phone. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5064.54s)]
*  I made a story up because I'd gotten married technically and I told him I was [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5066.3s)]
*  getting a divorce, but I had to relocate my, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5070.3s)]
*  my wife and my kids to El Paso where her family was at. Once that's done, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5072.78s)]
*  I'm pulling chocks. I'm coming to Massachusetts. We had already created, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5077.04s)]
*  it was in the creation, uh, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5080.58s)]
*  our own biker club that it was approved by the top of the outlaws to be the [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5082.74s)]
*  number one support club in the Northeast. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5086.64s)]
*  And we were never named at the righteous few. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5088.900000000001s)]
*  Scott town was going to be the president. I was going to be an officer in it, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5090.5s)]
*  uh, sergeant in arms. And, uh, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5094.18s)]
*  and I never went back up there because they told me I couldn't. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5097.42s)]
*  When you get put on timeout, it's like, you know, travel, uh, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5100.26s)]
*  you can be a case agent. Um, we're going to suggest to your division, no travel, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5103.42s)]
*  uh, definitely no undercover work. Um, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5107.46s)]
*  there was some confusion there because one of the arguments is you need to [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5110.34s)]
*  ingrate, you need to, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5113.46s)]
*  you need to get back in to be in a case agent and remember what you're supposed [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5115.34s)]
*  to be doing. And I'm like, I never stopped being a case. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5119.08s)]
*  I'm running all these damn cases while all this is going on. But, uh, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5121.26s)]
*  I took a timeout. Um, well, I've made some phone calls. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5125.34s)]
*  There was one guy named Tim Sylvia, not the fighter, uh, who is a buddy now, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5129.34s)]
*  by the way. Um, Tim, this guy's name was Tim Sylvia. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5133.26s)]
*  He had been in prison most of his life. Uh, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5137.38s)]
*  but before I stopped going up there, he was introduced to me. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5140.38s)]
*  He knew about the cocaine. He knew about what I did. He calls me and says, man, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5145.120000000001s)]
*  uh, I got some stolen vehicles for you. Uh, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5149.46s)]
*  I'm in the magic powder business. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5152.54s)]
*  If you can get me those bricks or whatever he called them code on the [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5154.46s)]
*  phone, uh, for 18 a piece, I can buy 10 of them right now. Um, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5159.400000000001s)]
*  so I called the case team and said, look, he's reaching out to me. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5163.740000000001s)]
*  I can't come back up there. Uh, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5165.9400000000005s)]
*  so we rigged it up to where the guys that were posing as my truck drivers went [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5167.92s)]
*  and they were going to pick up these stolen vehicles. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5172.42s)]
*  They had like a seven series BMW worth a hundred plus grand at the time and some [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5175.26s)]
*  other vehicles while they were with them. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5180.02s)]
*  So here I am on time out in my garage sweating my tail off in McAllen and I've [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5182.4400000000005s)]
*  got my two phones. I'm talking to the undercovers. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5187.160000000001s)]
*  I'm talking to Tim Sylvia. I'm telling them where to go. They're being covered. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5189.46s)]
*  They go, they meet while they're meeting Tim. Uh, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5194.4400000000005s)]
*  the truck driver supposed play in my truck driver calls me. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5198.780000000001s)]
*  You can hear me clearly on the recording. I'm talking on it. And, uh, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5202.02s)]
*  I tell him how much to pay Tim for the stolen vehicles. And Tim was like, Hey, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5205.38s)]
*  I'm going to report the BMW stole stolen on Friday. And I said, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5209.82s)]
*  can you make it Saturday? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5213.099999999999s)]
*  Give me 24 hours more to get this thing into Mexico. And they did that. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5214.0199999999995s)]
*  And then when they went to load the vehicles, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5218.46s)]
*  he hit them for an 18 a key for 10 keys. And they said, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5221.599999999999s)]
*  yes. And they ended the case with them doing a ruse delivery of that dope. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5226.32s)]
*  And so you ask about the relationships. So this is how it ends. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5231.98s)]
*  I'm in Nevada helping put on an undercover school. Uh, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5236.66s)]
*  that was one thing that Safeguard said I could go to, uh, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5240.4s)]
*  because they also knew they could do many assessments, watch me, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5243.18s)]
*  put me around other undercovers, make sure I'm not losing my shit. And, uh, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5245.78s)]
*  I can't remember the time difference, uh, to Massachusetts, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5250.86s)]
*  but I've already been drawing up diagrams of all these houses and club houses. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5253.88s)]
*  I've been in and I'm, you know, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5258.54s)]
*  sending those to all these SWAT teams all over the Northeast that are going to be [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5260.46s)]
*  hitting all these places. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5263.86s)]
*  And I got back to my hotel room and I always kept my undercover with a case [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5265.78s)]
*  went over technically yet anyway, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5271.78s)]
*  but I always kept my undercover phones on for at least a month after a case went [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5272.94s)]
*  down because you got threatened or anything like that. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5276.5s)]
*  Well I get back to my room and my next tail is chirping and I check and it's [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5279.82s)]
*  Scott town. He's left me a message. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5284.139999999999s)]
*  So I chirp him up and he's all raspy voice cause he's been just woken up and [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5286.259999999999s)]
*  he's like, Hey man, I just want you to know, uh, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5290.38s)]
*  your, your truck driver Tony and then the other guy, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5293.22s)]
*  they were beating big Timmy and I don't know what happened, but they all, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5296.22s)]
*  I think they all got locked up. Well, he doesn't know that I'm an undercover. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5299.160000000001s)]
*  And he's telling me that that was the take down day. So he's calling me and I'm [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5302.660000000001s)]
*  like, Oh, I said, well, you know what, brother, I appreciate that. I said, I don't, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5307.02s)]
*  I don't always control everything they do. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5310.26s)]
*  Sometimes they do side jobs on their own. I said, I, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5311.76s)]
*  they were not up there for me, but I'll try to find out what's going on. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5314.54s)]
*  He's let me tell you what I'm going to do. He said, I'm going to get up, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5318.1s)]
*  get cleaned up. I'm going to find out what the hell's going on. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5320.580000000001s)]
*  I'm going to call you back. And I said, okay. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5322.58s)]
*  His last words to me were I'm going to get choked up. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5325.26s)]
*  His last words to me were I love you brother. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5328.38s)]
*  And I churned back and I said, I love you too. And he didn't, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5331.3s)]
*  he didn't know that a SWAT team was going to be hitting him in about 40 [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5334.22s)]
*  minutes. That's the last time I talked to him. He'll probably hear this. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5336.5s)]
*  I got a 50, 50 shot. If he walks up, I'll hug him. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5341.82s)]
*  He probably wants to beat the shit out of me, but Jesus, man, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5344.86s)]
*  is he out? Yeah, he's out now. How much time did he do? [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5350.379999999999s)]
*  I think he did like eight, eight or 10 somewhere in there. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5353.419999999999s)]
*  Do you have this anxiety of running into those guys somewhere? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5357.459999999999s)]
*  Yes and no. It really comes with a job. However, somebody pointed, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5361.5s)]
*  pointed out a difference to me the other day. There I'm like, look, man, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5366.66s)]
*  as a cop or as an agent, you're locking people up and they're getting out. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5369.74s)]
*  You know, if you get threatened in Greenville County, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5375.9s)]
*  if you're working for Greenville County Sheriff's office, let's say we're here. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5377.58s)]
*  Was it Travis County? If you get a threat, a legit threat in Travis County, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5379.58s)]
*  do you think they got the money in the budget or they would even spend money in [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5383.22s)]
*  their budget to move you to another town? No, but in the FBI, we have that. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5385.98s)]
*  You hit the threat system, they move you somewhere, change a bunch of stuff. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5390.78s)]
*  So in the law enforcement, there's always been, you can lock people up. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5394.34s)]
*  You go to the grocery store, you're with your wife and kids and you see them. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5397.9s)]
*  Everybody handles it their own way. For me, my best defense is a good offense. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5402.34s)]
*  I'll just walk right up to you. Hey man, holy shit. How are you doing? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5407.38s)]
*  I cannot believe, when did you get out? Are you okay? Hey, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5413.02s)]
*  are you on the straight and narrow now? You know, because I'm going to tell you, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5416.700000000001s)]
*  transparent, there's few things I love more than a success story. Sadly, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5419.9400000000005s)]
*  they're very rare in my 28 year career, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5425.18s)]
*  but to see somebody who broke the law, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5427.660000000001s)]
*  got out, turned themselves around and are doing great. I love it. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5432.22s)]
*  You do see some of those. Yeah. And I'll help them. I'm helping one right now. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5436.0599999999995s)]
*  I told them, I said, look, if you're doing the right thing, they're like, well, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5439.94s)]
*  I got a felon on my record. I'm like, well, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5442.82s)]
*  who better to be a reference for you on your application than the guy who gave [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5445.0199999999995s)]
*  you the felon? If you're doing the right thing, I'll talk for you. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5448.459999999999s)]
*  We all mess up. I mean, shit, you know, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5452.5s)]
*  but that's gotta be so complicated because you're the guy who got them arrested. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5455.459999999999s)]
*  It is. And I have had threats that were legit. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5459.66s)]
*  And I've had them at the sheriff's office where I was like, what do we do? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5464.139999999999s)]
*  And my lieutenant is like, we're going to get some cops and we're going to knock [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5466.7s)]
*  on that day's door. Okay. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5469.0599999999995s)]
*  And I've also been in the FBI where you could have gotten moved. And I decided, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5471.58s)]
*  no, I'm not. Once that case gets taken down, I'm overt. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5475.16s)]
*  Like a lot of people may not know it. I'm not trying to insult intelligence, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5479.219999999999s)]
*  but when you're arrested, I may be arrested with you. I may not be. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5482.38s)]
*  There's all kinds of ways we can do a takedown, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5486.099999999999s)]
*  but eventually you're going to be sitting with your defense attorney and you're [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5487.78s)]
*  going to get discovery and discovery is supposed to be everything. Now, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5490.86s)]
*  there have been FBI people who did not turn over everything and it was very [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5494.62s)]
*  wrong and we are still paying the price for it, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5497.74s)]
*  but discovery is supposed to be everything. And at that point, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5499.5199999999995s)]
*  you're going to hear me on a preamble. You're going to hear me go, let's see, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5503.5s)]
*  what's the day you're going to hear me go? This is UCE undercover employee. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5506.5s)]
*  This is UCE one, two, whatever. It's Wednesday, March 26 central time, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5509.94s)]
*  2 45 PM about the walk in to meet Joe. And they're going to hear that. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5514.5s)]
*  And they're going to know that I'm the undercover. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5518.74s)]
*  They may not know my last name's pain, but they're going to know. Now, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5520.54s)]
*  what somebody pointed out to me was, you know, as a cop though, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5524.780000000001s)]
*  you're just doing your job and you're resting them as an undercover. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5529.42s)]
*  You've lied to them. And I went, Hmm, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5531.900000000001s)]
*  probably should have thought about that for I did the book. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5533.860000000001s)]
*  But I, I try not to, I don't, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5539.3s)]
*  I don't want to live my life in fear. I'm a optimist. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5543.42s)]
*  I'm a glass is always half full guy. God, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5546.62s)]
*  that's hard to believe given your circumstances. I don't know how, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5550.14s)]
*  for me personally, I don't know how to survive otherwise. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5553.34s)]
*  Cause if I was doom and gloom and the glass is always half empty, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5556.0199999999995s)]
*  maybe this is a good time to interject this first responders military. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5560.46s)]
*  Do you know what we're number? I'm talking fire medic cop, uh, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5564.34s)]
*  military, you know, we're number one in suicide, suicide. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5568.9s)]

*  throw in pills or whatever you want there. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5576.34s)]
*  We're also number one in dying within five years after retiring. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5578.02s)]
*  Who signs up for that? Right. You know, hell yeah. First in hell, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5583.1s)]
*  second in heaven. No, no, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5588.1s)]
*  I'll pass. But yeah, so that hurt. I mean, it's very, it's surreal. Um, [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5593.34s)]
*  and yeah, great job, but yeah, I mean, I'm human. And, and, uh, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5598.3s)]
*  and I did really bond with that guy. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5602.34s)]
*  And just like, I felt like a piece of trash when clothesline told me that I was [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5604.34s)]
*  really, he considered me really his friend. Wow. You know, so how's he doing now? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5608.780000000001s)]
*  I don't know if he's out or not. He had, he was supposed to get, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5613.700000000001s)]
*  I think he got 12 and a half, but I didn't keep up with it. I mean, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5616.18s)]
*  sometimes people go to jail, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5619.540000000001s)]
*  they pick up some more charges cause they did something stupid in jail. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5620.740000000001s)]
*  But I will tell you talking on that trans, uh, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5623.820000000001s)]
*  talking on that success story thing, most of my career, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5626.700000000001s)]
*  uh, with the exception of a pedophile, um, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5630.74s)]
*  almost everybody I've arrested, I'll sit down with them and I'll say, listen, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5635.5s)]
*  I'm not saying I think you're a bad person. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5639.38s)]
*  I'm not saying I disagree with what you did. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5642.42s)]
*  What I'm saying is is you're an adult, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5644.46s)]
*  you made a choice to break the law and you got caught. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5646.3s)]
*  So let's just start right here. This is whatever that is. All I got. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5648.58s)]
*  This is on the table. Let's don't do that date and game BS where you lie to me [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5651.22s)]
*  for two months and I lie to you for two months. And then when we were figuring [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5655.46s)]
*  out, we figured out we really do kind of like each other. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5657.86s)]
*  Now I can tell you the truth. This is what I got. And it's just, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5660.14s)]
*  it's not dehumanizing and there's still people and I love connecting with people. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5664.18s)]
*  Like I said, wow. It was a great attitude. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5669.860000000001s)]
*  Did you ever think like while you're talking to people like Scott town, like, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5673.14s)]
*  man, if my life had been different, I had gone down the wrong roads, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5675.9800000000005s)]
*  grew up in a different neighborhood, you would be one of them. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5678.780000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. That's why we had so much in common. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5683.46s)]
*  Yeah. That's part of the problem with life. Yeah. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5685.38s)]
*  Everybody wants to pretend that that could never be me. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5687.820000000001s)]
*  No, absolutely. It could have easily been me. And I'm like, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5690.62s)]
*  I looked at it and I'm like, it's that proverbial fork in the road. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5693.780000000001s)]
*  I went that way, but I got it. Easily went that way. Yeah. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5696.9400000000005s)]
*  That's why I got along with them so much. You know, [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5700.46s)]
*  like, yeah, other than like pedophile stuff. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5704.22s)]
*  So what pedophile stuff did you have to do? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5705.900000000001s)]
*  Actually one of the quickest undercovers I ever did was the most satisfying. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5708.860000000001s)]
*  And I actually did this one, I think before the outlaws. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5714.06s)]
*  I was in San Antonio. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5715.98s)]
*  They, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5719.139999999999s)]
*  there was a guy that got picked up from molesting a kid and I didn't know the [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5720.62s)]
*  whole backstory, but in the San Antonio vision, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5724.78s)]
*  the agents and stuff knew me or the SWAT people. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5727.66s)]
*  They knew I'm the undercover guy and they called me up because while he was in [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5729.5s)]
*  bear County in San Antonio, he approached, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5733.58s)]
*  somebody in jail solicited them to kill the kid or to find somebody that could [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5738.259999999999s)]
*  kill the kid. A lot of these murder for hire plans are stupid, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5742.259999999999s)]
*  but that's actually wasn't too bad of a plan. Like if the kids, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5745.78s)]
*  these cases are tough. They suck. They are, they're atrocious. They are, [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5749.58s)]
*  I mean, it's a waste of oxygen in my personal opinion, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5753.54s)]
*  but it's usually a kid from a broken home is after the fact. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5756.78s)]
*  It's an adult versus a kid. But he knew he wasn't going to do well in [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5760.98s)]
*  prison. So he approached somebody in prison who then, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5765.9s)]
*  as most people who are serving time do, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5770.139999999999s)]
*  they are trying to get credit to get out. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5772.54s)]
*  And that person called his attorney and that attorney called the FBI and they [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5775.46s)]
*  worked it out to where he intruded me. So I drive up to bear County. I, [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5779.26s)]
*  sign in cause he put me on the list. I go in and, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5784.26s)]
*  I'm in, I'm in the phone bank. It's all stainless steel. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5789.780000000001s)]
*  You can't hear nothing but baby mamas and everybody's screaming and cussing and [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5794.34s)]
*  pissed off. And here I am trying to get this recording through this glass. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5797.860000000001s)]
*  And I'm talking to the guy and I said, you know who I am? He's like, yeah, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5801.62s)]
*  I said, well, I hope you do it. Cause you put me on your list to come see you. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5806.1s)]
*  You know what I do. And he's like, yes, I was like slow rolling it. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5809.22s)]
*  I didn't know. I didn't want to scare him off. So I was like, you know, [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5812.14s)]
*  I'm in the extermination business. And he's like, yeah, I said, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5814.7s)]
*  I killed pests for 11. He said, yep, that's exactly what I wanted. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5817.34s)]
*  And I had a picture of the kid. Of course we're working with a family on this, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5821.9800000000005s)]
*  but I had a picture of the kid just walking like a surveillance photo. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5826.900000000001s)]
*  And I put it up on the window and I said, is this the pest? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5830.219999999999s)]
*  Uh, that you won't taken care of something to that effect. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5833.82s)]
*  And clearly on the recording, thank you Lord. It picked it up. He said, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5836.62s)]
*  that's him. So you're not going to call a bug him, right? So, um, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5839.82s)]
*  what I found out is I met him twice, uh, just a two meat thing. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5845.9s)]
*  But what I found out from the solicitor's office and in bear County, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5851.139999999999s)]
*  it was mostly women working it because it was the, [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5855.259999999999s)]
*  the crimes against children was combined with the domestic violence unit. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5857.86s)]
*  And Joe, when I went walking in there and they're like, this is Scott. I mean, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5862.66s)]
*  they all stood, it's like some TV show. They stood up and they started clapping. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5865.54s)]
*  I'm like, I don't understand. And they said me chest beating. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5868.179999999999s)]
*  That's not what I'm trying to, but it's like, what is going on? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5871.46s)]
*  They're like, thank you so much. You were so, and I'm like, I appreciate it, [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5873.54s)]
*  but I'm doing my job. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5877.86s)]
*  What they told me is that guy had walked on four molestation cases before. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5879.74s)]
*  Uh, and he also walked on some, uh, possession of, uh, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5884.34s)]
*  uh, somehow he got out of possession of child pornography stuff. And, uh, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5890.66s)]
*  but when he found out, when they approached him and said, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5895.3s)]
*  I was an undercover and that they got him, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5897.42s)]
*  he pled guilty to hiring me to kill the kid and pled guilty to the molestation [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5900.1s)]
*  of the kid. Matter of fact, when I was talking to him the first time, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5904.54s)]
*  he threw me off guard because he starts, he was like, yeah, yeah. And I go, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5907.06s)]
*  all right, well, what do you got this? [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5911.3s)]
*  And the other, we're talking to things and he goes, Hey, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5912.74s)]
*  I'd like you to kill the rest of his family too. They're in Wisconsin. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5913.74s)]
*  And I'm, I actually giggled a little bit because it threw me off. I went, well, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5916.26s)]
*  I'm not above traveling, but let's deal with one pest at a time. I'm like, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5920.98s)]
*  you agree. I'm thinking in my head, go man, you know, but he knew, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5923.58s)]
*  as most pedophiles do, you're not going to do well in prison. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5928.1s)]
*  So his idea was kill the kid, kill the family. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5931.3s)]
*  And then there's no evidence like he did. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5934.34s)]
*  He just gets to walk because there's no witness to show up to trial. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5936.38s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5939.66s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5940.5s)]
*  and then being around that stuff, like I've had trainees that, you know, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5944.18s)]
*  you get a new agent, they come in, they assign you as the training agent, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5947.88s)]
*  and they might be working that stuff. And I'll tell you for me personally, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5950.66s)]
*  um, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5955.22s)]
*  that's tough to work for me. It was before I even had girls before I even had kids. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5957.3s)]
*  I remember seeing like five images. We hit a guy, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5962.26s)]
*  he was actually a professor at university of Texas, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5965.7s)]
*  Pan Am and he was so vigilant. I mean, he had like, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5968.98s)]
*  he had all the, the, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5973.0599999999995s)]
*  the child porn videos broken down by ethnicity, age, sex. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5975.099999999999s)]
*  So I mean, you could say I want Asian male 11 and he would have, I mean, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5980.259999999999s)]
*  and it was just sick. Now, did he come from a messed up thing? Yeah. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5984.78s)]
*  Turns out his mother had molested him and his brother. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5988.58s)]
*  We'd tie them in the basement, tie them to each other, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5991.179999999999s)]
*  make them have sex with each other. But it's horrific, but break the chain, man, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5993.5s)]
*  break the chain. So yeah, I saw, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=5998.259999999999s)]
*  I saw like five photos and I was, I was messed up for probably a week or two. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6001.46s)]
*  A professor. Yeah. My wife would try to, she tried to touch me, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6005.179999999999s)]
*  not even just to be in it. I mean, just to touch and I'd be like, ah, no, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6008.58s)]
*  I'm like, I can't man. I gotta get this shit out of my head. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6012.54s)]
*  Now later on in undercovers, I could be the guy to drive and pick you up. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6015.7s)]
*  I could show you pictures. Is this what you want kind of thing? [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6019.58s)]
*  But to like sit there and look through that stuff, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6022.139999999999s)]
*  my brain's not cut out for that. Um, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6024.42s)]
*  but there are those who are and in the FBI, they, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6026.82s)]
*  if you're looking at that, you have to be psychologically assessed as well, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6031.299999999999s)]
*  as you should. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6033.94s)]
*  I could only imagine how are these guys getting these videos? [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6034.78s)]
*  Are they making them Joe? It is. There's like, see, that's the thing, right? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6038.98s)]
*  This is one of the huge, it's one of the freaking huge. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6043.099999999999s)]
*  That's the scary thing. Cause most people aren't aware of it. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6046.42s)]
*  And this is one of the big conspiracy theories that there's these pedophile [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6048.7s)]
*  rings out there, but they're real. Yeah. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6051.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Human trafficking. Now I can sway on some of the human trafficking stuff, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6054.179999999999s)]
*  cause I've seen human trafficking from the border all the way to the hotel room. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6058.099999999999s)]
*  Um, if it's, it's rarely a hooker over on free will or an escort of on free [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6062.98s)]
*  will. But if they're out there doing, I don't know, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6068.179999999999s)]
*  it gets a little muddy on some of the trafficking stuff for me personally, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6070.86s)]
*  but it's still trafficking. They got brought in when they were underage. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6073.9s)]
*  Now they're a product of what they've been forced to do. You know, that's, uh, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6077.179999999999s)]
*  it's very sad, but as far as the child porn stuff goes, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6080.54s)]
*  it's insane. I've worked with some, they call them ICACs, uh, um, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6083.66s)]
*  uh, crimes against children. Um, and there's so much out there, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6088.78s)]
*  but there were so much at one, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6093.54s)]
*  this is just me and in Tennessee. I'm with them. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6097.42s)]
*  They have so many hits on whatever dark web thing it is. Might be discord. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6100.42s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what it used to be, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6105.18s)]
*  but there's all kinds of stuff like that, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6106.98s)]
*  that they'll go to these and what they believe or what are encrypted apps, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6109.0199999999995s)]
*  uh, that are based overseas. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6114.94s)]
*  So they don't think that the FBI or feds here, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6117.5s)]
*  the alphabet boys and girls can do subpoenas and get that stuff. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6120.74s)]
*  That's why they use those. Now, does that mean that everybody on discourse? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6124.179999999999s)]
*  Bad? Absolutely not. Telegram? No. But do people go there to do bad things? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6127.139999999999s)]
*  Yep. Yeah. And it's just like, you could go. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6132.26s)]
*  I remember them showing me stuff as the undercover coordinator. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6134.86s)]
*  I'm over there and I'm looking at stuff and they're showing me what all the hits [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6137.82s)]
*  they've got right now, just people hitting. And through the databases, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6141.14s)]
*  you could do knock and talks every fricking day, all day long. Hey man, [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6145.14s)]
*  how you doing? Hey, not if we look at your computer, you might not get in there, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6148.82s)]
*  but yeah, it's, it's a mess. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6152.3s)]
*  A mess. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6155.82s)]
*  And so there's a whole ring of people all across the country. Yeah. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6156.94s)]
*  Or just mom and pops farming out their kids. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6160.5s)]
*  Yeah. Uh, sex across state lines. Yeah. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6164.82s)]
*  Not good at all. There's just [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6169.5s)]
*  like, again, I mentioned McCallum several times. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6175.179999999999s)]
*  This isn't undercover stuff, but case agent stuff. I mean, there's, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6177.419999999999s)]
*  I might look at doing a book on case agent stuff. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6180.94s)]
*  I was down there working the cartel with me and my, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6183.74s)]
*  and the people I worked with that was back when OZR Cardenas ran the golf [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6186.259999999999s)]
*  cartel. So it was violent, violent as you know what, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6191.18s)]
*  but there was some kind of SOP. There was like a procedure. Um, but I mean, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6194.26s)]
*  when I try to tell people, I'm like, look, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6199.700000000001s)]
*  I don't care whether you're left or right. I meet all kinds of people. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6201.42s)]
*  If you're extreme left, I'm probably going to tell you you're an idiot. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6204.66s)]
*  If you're extreme right, I know you're an idiot cause I've been with them. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6207.780000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I just want to bring it. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6213.06s)]
*  What's so funny is you start here and you go far left and they're like, I want it. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6214.22s)]
*  I'm a socialist. I'm a socialist. I want everything for free. I want it. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6217.9400000000005s)]
*  And you start here on the far right and they're like, I want Hitler. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6220.98s)]
*  I want Hitler. But that socialism you get here, it's the same shit. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6223.219999999999s)]
*  They just want the stuff for free. I want all whites. Well, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6226.38s)]
*  that'll fix everything. You know, it's just, it's insane. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6229.54s)]
*  But down on the border, you tell people, you're like, man, they just, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6233.74s)]
*  I'm not saying that I'm not trying to shed a bad light on Mexico and stuff, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6236.78s)]
*  but it, a lot of it runs on corruption. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6240.46s)]
*  A lot of it runs on money and they do not value life like we do. I mean, man, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6243.219999999999s)]
*  they chop heads off. It's Al Qaeda stuff. I mean, they're sawing heads off. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6248.22s)]
*  You find a van full of eight heads. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6252.54s)]
*  We worked kidnapping, seeing extortions down there all the time back then. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6256.780000000001s)]
*  One of the, one of the cases, OZL, it was, we thought it was a wives tale. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6260.46s)]
*  And this is sick. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6265.22s)]
*  So I apologize to people that think this is way gross, but it's real. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6266.18s)]
*  The first one in that gross, he had a line he would feed people to a line. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6271.820000000001s)]
*  And that was the rumor. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6276.74s)]
*  And then I can't remember if they went up in a fixed wing or a helicopter, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6277.86s)]
*  but they flew over the line and somebody was asking the other one, Hey, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6281.62s)]
*  what are all those bones? And they were like, Oh, you know, chicken, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6285.099999999999s)]
*  that's a big ass chicken. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6288.34s)]
*  That chicken was like a femur, you know? So there's that. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6291.46s)]
*  But the one that was really sick is a, so when they would kidnap you, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6295.0199999999995s)]
*  like if you lost a load or they thought you stole something or you didn't pay [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6298.139999999999s)]
*  your quotas, because even as a, as a undocumented special interest alien, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6301.82s)]
*  whatever you want to call it, illegal alien smuggler, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6306.1s)]
*  you had to pay quotas to the cartel to smuggle through their territory. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6310.06s)]
*  Same thing with dope. If you got behind on that, they kidnap you. Same MO, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6313.14s)]
*  three Suburbans pull up somewhere in South Texas, jump out on such and such corner. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6318.26s)]
*  Everybody's in black, beat EUs. They grab you. That was the status. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6322.620000000001s)]
*  They were the enforcement cartel. They'd take you over, beat you, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6325.46s)]
*  start calling the family saying we want a hundred grand, 300 grand, whatever. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6328.34s)]
*  You start, we'd start brokering the deal because we have border liaison officers [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6331.9400000000005s)]
*  and we would do cross trainings with military and police in Mexico. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6335.58s)]
*  So the borderly AI officer calls and goes, Hey, it's such a, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6340.74s)]
*  such time of day on this corner. Three Suburbans pulled up. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6343.54s)]
*  The guy's name is this. It was this time of day, 30 minutes, 40, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6346.1s)]
*  30 minutes to an hour later, we get a call back. They got him. What's the deal? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6349.5s)]
*  He, he brought a load back and it was missing a hundred grand. Okay. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6352.94s)]
*  So now I'm in the house with the family going, okay, they want 300 grand. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6357.42s)]
*  Well, we don't have it. Well, they don't have it. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6362.0199999999995s)]
*  Uh, they want a hundred grand. Uh, we don't have it. Well, what do you got? [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6364.820000000001s)]
*  We got 60 grand. What else they got? Remember my V8 four by four, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6368.660000000001s)]
*  they got a suburban. Uh, how many miles are on it? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6372.900000000001s)]
*  And here we are at midnight rolling the suburban over the bridge with $60,000 [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6375.42s)]
*  to get the son back. So one of the, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6380.26s)]
*  we thought was a wives tale is that OZL had a, I don't, [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6383.38s)]
*  I don't know what the politically correct term is these days, but a midget, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6387.860000000001s)]
*  small person. I don't know. Uh, but the rumor was back then that he had a midget, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6390.62s)]
*  he was very well endowed and he would rate people for the cartel. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6395.9s)]
*  And he's let that soak in for a little bit. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6402.26s)]
*  Uh, my comedy starts coming out. I'm like, how do you get the small person? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6406.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6409.5s)]
*  That's his thing. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6411.1s)]
*  So, uh, we all thought it was BS. And then there was a Christmas Eve. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6412.66s)]
*  Uh, we started getting calls. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6417.860000000001s)]
*  I was actually driving to Arizona for vacation, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6420.54s)]
*  but I was on the phone calling sources and calling all the other agents. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6425.38s)]
*  The, this guy had, uh, basically carjacked a car in Rio [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6429.22s)]
*  Grande city. So directly across the river is Camargo. So he gets in there. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6434.54s)]
*  He didn't look at the back seat as an infant. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6439.42s)]
*  Now the cartel is pissed at him for bringing heat and they are beating him and [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6441.66s)]
*  they're, I mean, it's, they used to hit them with the clubs, throw kilos, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6444.9s)]
*  bricks at them, cigarette burns, cigar burns, real big, um, uh, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6448.9s)]
*  battery cables, stuff like that, threatening them. And, uh, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6454.139999999999s)]
*  we got him back. But when he came across the bridge, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6458.339999999999s)]
*  my peers called me and go, holy shit, Scott is real. I go, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6461.139999999999s)]
*  what are you talking about? This dude is bawling. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6464.54s)]
*  When the call came in and the cartel was like, okay, let this one go. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6467.38s)]
*  The midget was in the room. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6471.74s)]
*  That guy was crying when he came back across the bridge. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6473.42s)]
*  He was getting ready to get raped. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6475.46s)]
*  Wow. Slightly sick, right? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6478.5s)]
*  Yeah, slightly. It's a different world. Yeah. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6480.66s)]
*  That's probably the least bad thing they can do to you. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6484.42s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know how to look in the mirror after all that. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6488.38s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, you get out alive, I guess. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6492.74s)]
*  It's insane. Or do you? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6495.58s)]
*  So other than the pedophile cases, uh, what, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6498.099999999999s)]
*  what were the most like shocking cases that you had to do? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6502.5s)]
*  Well, they're all a little shocking in their own way. Um, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6507.14s)]
*  the pedophile one's gotta be the hardest one to like sleep at night. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6510.9s)]
*  Yeah. But what a good feeling to get him. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6513.7s)]
*  That's a different feeling. That's a non-conflicted feeling when you get him. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6517.5s)]
*  Good. Yeah. When she called me, uh, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6520.7s)]
*  when the assistant solicitor called me and said, Hey, he played guilty. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6522.46s)]
*  He got 20 for, I can't remember which was for which, but he got 20 years for, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6526.26s)]
*  uh, I believe the most molestation in 10 for hiring me to kill him. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6530.740000000001s)]
*  So, and then they had to do state of Texas with 85%. Um, so yeah, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6534.38s)]
*  it was going to be a tough ride for him. Pardon the bun. Yeah. But, uh, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6539.860000000001s)]
*  yeah. So crazy stuff, man. I mean, some of that Neo Nazi stuff was just insane. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6544.9800000000005s)]
*  How'd you get involved in that? [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6549.46s)]
*  Well, uh, number one, I go where my skill set takes me. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6551.02s)]
*  Number two, we kind of go to what the shift is in the FBI, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6555.58s)]
*  where people doing a lot of biker club stuff anymore. Not at that time. Uh, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6559.54s)]
*  I was a criminal, uh, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6563.82s)]
*  criminal investigator for pretty much my entire career. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6565.82s)]
*  But towards the end, uh, in Tennessee, um, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6569.98s)]
*  I switched over to the joint terrorism task force and I really did it because it [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6574.099999999999s)]
*  was just, I was having some disagreements. Some would be likely, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6577.7s)]
*  but I was having disagreements with management and my MO had always been, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6582.2s)]
*  even though I'd burned myself out before, once I got to Tennessee, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6585.62s)]
*  I set up accountability buddies. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6589.18s)]
*  I set up trip wires and stopped saying yes to everything and made ways to relax [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6591.86s)]
*  and balance and get myself back. Um, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6598.54s)]
*  but towards the end, uh, we, [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6603.3s)]
*  I switched over to joint terrorism task force because again, my MO was, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6606.98s)]
*  try to be above average on your squad. Um, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6611.1s)]
*  and then if you're kicking butt on stats and stuff like that, then, uh, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6614.0199999999995s)]
*  maybe they won't say no to let me go do the undercover. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6618.82s)]
*  Maybe they won't say no to let me go help put on this SWAT school or this SWAT [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6621.58s)]
*  call out. And that was what I did. Um, [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6626.16s)]
*  but that wasn't working for me in Tennessee anymore. And I, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6629.9s)]
*  I went to the head of the division and requested to be moved. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6634.299999999999s)]
*  So I went to joint terrorism task force and, uh, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6638.299999999999s)]
*  my skillset kind of led right into that domestic terrorism stuff. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6641.62s)]
*  Cause it was like in the state of Tennessee, you have Aryan nations, uh, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6644.24s)]
*  which was the Tennessee, uh, department of, uh, corrections, TDOC, [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6648.64s)]
*  uh, prison gang, but it's white supremacy. Um, so as a case agent, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6654.26s)]
*  I started working that stuff and then I just started getting more exposed to [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6658.18s)]
*  those kinds of cases. So now when the canvases start coming up or we're running [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6662.24s)]
*  an undercover op ourselves, uh, those cases are coming in and it's like, okay, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6665.9s)]
*  I'll do that one unless anybody's got a disagreement, you know, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6671.02s)]
*  and that's what I started doing. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6673.740000000001s)]
*  That's how we kind of got into those cause we started getting more threats, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6675.3s)]
*  you know, after the Charlottesville stuff, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6678.580000000001s)]
*  now it's really getting kind of on the radar. They're like, man, this is, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6680.860000000001s)]
*  maybe we should be putting more resources. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6684.18s)]
*  Maybe we should be putting the FBI saying, [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6688.18s)]
*  maybe we should be putting more resources to this domestic terrorism threat. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6690.360000000001s)]
*  And that's what I started getting. I mean, I would go into, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6693.540000000001s)]
*  I kind of mentioned it earlier, but a, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6696.42s)]
*  a neo Nazi group, uh, but it's mainly online. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6700.58s)]
*  And here I am for five months reading post after post. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6704.66s)]
*  And if I woke up after six hours of sleep and there was, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6707.78s)]
*  I was 1500 posts behind, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6710.4400000000005s)]
*  I'd rewind it and read them all for five months cause I didn't want to miss [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6712.18s)]
*  anything. Me personally, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6715.78s)]
*  I didn't want to miss anything or anything bad happened because I missed [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6716.9400000000005s)]
*  something. But after five months and maybe meeting them once or twice, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6720.18s)]
*  there was, it's all first amendment protected. They weren't, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6723.7s)]
*  they weren't doing any thing to prepare for the violence, to cause violence. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6726.78s)]
*  They're just preparing for the day. And then when the day happens, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6732.54s)]
*  then they'll be ready. But again, uh, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6736.7s)]
*  I talked to people overseas, Canada, whatever I have to explain. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6739.82s)]
*  I'm like, look in the United States, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6742.78s)]
*  we have a constitution and your first amendment, uh, is freedom of speech. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6743.94s)]
*  I said, you can walk out in the street right here and say, I hate every, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6748.62s)]
*  say a racial slur. I hope every racial slur dies. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6751.98s)]
*  That's not illegal. As you know, have you seen it? [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6756.3s)]
*  You can burn American flags, freedom of speech. Try that in China. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6759.26s)]
*  Right. Let me know how that works for you. Death to China, [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6764.139999999999s)]
*  light the flag on fire. I'm not sure how long you'll last. Right. Not long. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6767.0599999999995s)]
*  But, um, that's what we, that's, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6770.46s)]
*  that's the hard thing about working domestic terrorism is there's no federal [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6774.34s)]
*  domestic terrorism statute. So you're trying to see what crimes are they [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6779.06s)]
*  committing, if any, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6782.780000000001s)]
*  and what can we do to get them off the street if they're planning bad things. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6783.9800000000005s)]
*  So how did you infiltrate the neo-Nazi organization? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6788.18s)]
*  Did you actually meet with them in person or was it mostly online? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6792.3s)]
*  Uh, so I'll just jump to the base. Okay. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6796.700000000001s)]
*  Because the base was the one that's kind of the beginning and the end of the [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6800.9400000000005s)]
*  book. They were actively recruiting. I mean, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6804.42s)]
*  I was in the clan too for a little while, uh, for the job. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6807.74s)]
*  I gotta be careful. I say, right. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6811.179999999999s)]
*  Back when I was in the clan, uh, we were good old boys. Um, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6814.9s)]
*  but, uh, the, [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6819.42s)]
*  they were recruiting openly online. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6821.62s)]
*  The base was and the base is an accelerationist group. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6824.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's what I, again, great detail in the book, uh, in the podcast. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6828.3s)]
*  But the thing is, is most people here, white supremacy, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6833.04s)]
*  they think hoods and robes and crosses on fire. Right. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6836.74s)]
*  That's not this man. These are, these are, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6841.62s)]
*  this is why they're called accelerationists. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6845.26s)]
*  There's a book out there called siege, uh, written by James Mason, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6846.639999999999s)]
*  long time white supremacists. It's a weird book. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6850.219999999999s)]
*  It's basically articles and interviews all just shoved together. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6852.5s)]
*  But this guy kind of idolized and interviewed people like Charles Manson. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6856.099999999999s)]
*  You know, what a great girl role model. Um, I mean, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6860.58s)]
*  if you're looking, uh, but he, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6865.06s)]
*  he created a group called Adam Waffen. And this is what accelerationism is. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6869.38s)]
*  Cause when I go to infiltrate the base, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6873.6s)]
*  I'm just answering stuff they're putting out there. Emails, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6875.820000000001s)]
*  they're posting on gab, uh, save your race, join the base. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6878.620000000001s)]
*  We're a survivalist group. Um, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6883.04s)]
*  email is at the base underscore one at protonmail.com. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6885.22s)]
*  So I started answering that stuff after about a week or so of emails back and [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6889.22s)]
*  forth asking me, asking me everything. My ethnicity, my height, weight, uh, [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6893.34s)]
*  when was my red pill moment, which they kind of use the matrix thing there. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6897.54s)]
*  So if they say, when were you red pill as a Christ follower, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6901.66s)]
*  it's the same thing as when I was baptized or when I got saved. Right. So if, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6905.18s)]
*  if the, if you're an accelerationist or that level of neo Nazi, and they say, [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6908.78s)]
*  what was your red pill moment? You need to know it. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6912.22s)]
*  Cause it's kind of like the big deal. That's when you said, [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6914.26s)]
*  hate all of the people. So after about a week, a week or so of emails, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6918.46s)]
*  I get on, uh, they tell me to download the wire app, similar to WhatsApp. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6923.42s)]
*  You can call and talk on it and stuff like that and create groups all over. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6927.62s)]
*  So I do like about an hour and 15 minute interview panel of like four or five [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6932.860000000001s)]
*  people asking me all kinds of stuff. I answered the best I could, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6937.88s)]
*  best I prepared for. And then they gave me a 24 hour rest period. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6941.66s)]
*  Cause they said, now that you know what we are, [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6946.02s)]
*  we're going to give you 24 hours to think about if you want to be a part of us. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6948.14s)]
*  And we want 24 hours to think about it. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6951.46s)]
*  But this is what they told me accelerationism was. They said, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6953.38s)]
*  accelerationists, they call it siege culture, kind of far laying off the book, [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6958.78s)]
*  but they do not believe there's a political solution to save the white race. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6963.02s)]
*  They believe that society is either going to collapse on its own or from manmade [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6967.86s)]
*  events. And they want to speed that up. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6971.58s)]
*  The group I was in was calling that Boogaloo, the Boogaloo. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6974.3s)]
*  And everything always ends with an ethnostate. Now it's not saying they, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6977.5s)]
*  the groups that I was in, they weren't going to take over the entire United [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6980.98s)]
*  States, but they, the group I was in, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6984.0199999999995s)]
*  one section was looking at property and land in the Appalachian mountains. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6986.82s)]
*  One section of the base was looking at the upper peninsula of Michigan. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6990.219999999999s)]
*  One section of the base had property in the Pacific Northwest. So [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=6994.0599999999995s)]
*  you get in there, you start learning that ideology. But again, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7000.459999999999s)]
*  in the beginning, I'm just ingratiating. I don't, I mean, [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7004.459999999999s)]
*  we know they've been saying crazy stuff online, but is it illegal per se? No. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7007.139999999999s)]
*  But are they planning on taking steps to do some bad things? [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7011.219999999999s)]
*  And that goes back to that domestic terrorism culture. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7014.98s)]
*  You go in telegram or whatever, you, [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7017.179999999999s)]
*  I mean you've got your, your Terrence and your Brevix and they're in there, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7019.86s)]
*  4chan, 8chan, and they're posting right before they go and commit all the [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7024.66s)]
*  murders. You know, here I am. I'm going live. Watch this. Yeah. So, [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7027.9s)]
*  but imagine being in law enforcement and trying to look at all these thousands [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7033.58s)]
*  of posts and trying to figure out, well, [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7038.14s)]
*  which one's actually going to follow through, [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7040.42s)]
*  which one is seriously planning on doing something. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7042.14s)]
*  So you always got to stay vigilant and keep going after it. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7045.02s)]
*  So what were these guys planning on doing? What was their, their accelerate moment? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7048.1s)]
*  Well, per the siege culture, they like to do like, um, [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7053.54s)]
*  guerrilla warfare tactics. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7058.42s)]
*  So they're against the Charlottesville stuff, being in a group, [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7060.54s)]
*  picket signs, screaming racial slurs, you know, all this stuff. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7065.02s)]
*  But they're against that. They're like, that's stupid. You're number one, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7067.94s)]
*  you're making yourself a target. You're not doing anything. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7070.179999999999s)]
*  It's more guerrilla warfare tactics where, uh, [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7072.379999999999s)]
*  let's say over here in Austin power grid goes down over here. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7075.219999999999s)]
*  Train gets derailed over here. Water systems poisoned, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7079.58s)]
*  anything to create chaos and killing of anybody left. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7082.74s)]
*  Anti-fash, um, uh, non whites, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7087.299999999999s)]
*  very anti-Semitic, very like way more than, [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7091.379999999999s)]
*  uh, it kind of opened my eyes when I started getting into some of these neo [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7095.54s)]
*  Nazis. Cause for the most part, I thought when I thought racism, [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7099.0599999999995s)]
*  I thought white against black, right? But these, these neo Nazis groups I was in, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7102.66s)]
*  man, they are, they are anti-Semitic, man. They cannot stand Jews. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7107.299999999999s)]
*  Wow. It's like, like it's sickening if you, if you listen to it. But again, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7111.86s)]
*  they want that Hitler, they want Hitler back. I mean, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7116.62s)]
*  some of these guys were like talking about, uh, concave earth, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7119.58s)]
*  hollow earth. Hitler's still alive. He's in hollow earth. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7123.98s)]
*  He's with giant white men who are Anglo white with red hair and 15 [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7128.0599999999995s)]
*  plus foot tall. And I'm like, and I go, [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7133.0599999999995s)]
*  so where are these 15 foot tall white guys? And they're like, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7136.58s)]
*  well they're in the middle earth with Hitler. They're waiting. And I go, for what? [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7141.219999999999s)]
*  If we're going to take a contract, come on, but let's do this. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7144.339999999999s)]
*  Let's take this thing down. And sometimes I'm just comical with them. You're like, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7147.94s)]
*  Hey, we're neo Nazis. Yeah. We're going to get the ethnostate. Yeah. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7151.1s)]
*  We're ready for the bugaloo. Yeah. We're building our kit. Yeah. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7154.22s)]
*  Who's going to be Hitler? And everybody goes, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7156.820000000001s)]
*  are they only one buddy? Are we going to fight it out right now? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7162.22s)]
*  Who's going to win this thing? But what happened with the base is a lot of them [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7165.620000000001s)]
*  were into the pagan. And I say this loosely, [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7170.3s)]
*  I have plenty of friends that are pagan. Um, uh, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7174.18s)]
*  Satru and they are great people. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7178.82s)]
*  Love. What do you mean by pagan? Um, like the, like, uh, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7183.42s)]
*  so there's different pantheons, but the most common one is Norse, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7188.0199999999995s)]
*  Norse mythology. So basically the, you know, um, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7191.5s)]
*  it's basically Marvel universe. Uh, so they worship ancient culture. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7196.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Uh, Thor or whatever. Yeah. Oh yeah, man. Um, [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7200.86s)]
*  like there's a church for that. Well, I don't want to say a church per se, [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7205.26s)]
*  but yeah, the whole block, a blot is just think Viking kind of stuff. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7208.9800000000005s)]
*  The ones that do it that are serious, uh, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7213.34s)]
*  they're upset that white supremacists have taken their stuff and used it. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7216.740000000001s)]
*  But if you look at Hitler, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7220.02s)]
*  Hitler was already looking into that Norse mythology too. He has, you know, [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7221.1s)]
*  he had, you know, looking for Thor's hammer or whatever, the Holy grail, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7224.58s)]
*  biblical and all this stuff. Um, but there's, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7228.02s)]
*  there's Christian identity, [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7232.5s)]
*  which is making a comeback in the white supremacy realm, [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7233.820000000001s)]
*  not to be confused with Christianity. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7236.900000000001s)]
*  Christian identity is if you can wrap your mind around this, they, [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7238.74s)]
*  a lot of them have a, uh, it's the dual seed line belief. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7243.14s)]
*  So they take the story of the garden, garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7246.780000000001s)]
*  the serpent and the fruit of the forbidden tree. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7250.66s)]
*  They take that story and they say, okay, it's still the same, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7253.26s)]
*  except the fruit of the forbidden tree is a sexual act with the serpent. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7256.7s)]
*  Who is a man of color, also known as Satan. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7262.46s)]
*  And then when Satan sleeps with Eve, their offspring is Kane. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7266.22s)]
*  And they are the mud race from then on. That's what they call it. Mudder. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7270.74s)]
*  It's non-white mud race from then on down. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7273.4800000000005s)]
*  But the procreation from Adam and Eve is able, and that's the pure white race. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7275.68s)]
*  That's just one of the many belief systems. So when you see, I know, right? [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7280.54s)]
*  Yeah. I'm like shaking my head like, what the fuck? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7285.900000000001s)]
*  Well, how did you get that? Um, [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7288.860000000001s)]
*  what are they using as like references? Like how do they get this information? [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7291.7s)]
*  So as far back as that I know, I'm sure it came out earlier, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7295.38s)]
*  but there was the Aryan nation, uh, Reverend Butler, red, [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7300.0599999999995s)]
*  Ray fair and all that stuff. And they taught that they taught the Christian [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7303.38s)]
*  identity, church of Jesus Christ, Christian. Um, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7305.78s)]
*  and they take that and twist it, you know, as if Jesus is just a white guy. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7309.46s)]
*  And so did you physically meet with these guys and infiltrate their [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7314.0599999999995s)]
*  organization? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7317.82s)]
*  Yeah, some of some of those, yes. Um, [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7319.38s)]
*  and the Christian identity was kind of in the clan belief that I, [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7322.259999999999s)]
*  that I was in for a short moment. But the, the pagan, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7324.98s)]
*  just like I said that the Christian identity takes the Bible and twist it, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7329.38s)]
*  then the paganism is taken Norse mythology or [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7333.66s)]
*  if you're an Egyptian Pantheon or whatever, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7338.46s)]
*  and they're twisting it towards their white supremacy. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7340.099999999999s)]
*  And that's not what paganism really is. If you know, [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7342.54s)]
*  like again, I've got friends that do it. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7347.26s)]
*  They're upset with white supremacists using their stuff. But then again, [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7349.18s)]
*  in the base, there was a guy who wasn't a satire priest and he led the first [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7353.5s)]
*  blood I ever attended be LOT, which is kind of like the worship ceremony, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7357.54s)]
*  um, for pagans. I mean, we're down there with our shirts off, [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7362.66s)]
*  wiping blood on our chest, drinking mead as if we're Vikings, [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7364.860000000001s)]
*  and then, uh, pray into our gods. And they would take a wood, um, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7369.34s)]
*  carved the wood and they would carve runes and like white supremacy symbols in [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7374.06s)]
*  it. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7377.740000000001s)]
*  And we would cut ourselves and bleed on the runes and then set that on fire and [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7378.22s)]
*  pray until the fire went out. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7382.580000000001s)]
*  Whoa. Yeah. And that was kind of, [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7386.42s)]
*  these guys are out there in the world. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7388.700000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, there's, there's academia stuff that they're like, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7391.06s)]
*  there's millions of white supremacists and Nazis are going to be on your [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7394.9800000000005s)]
*  doorstep tomorrow. I'm not going to say that. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7397.540000000001s)]
*  Well they want to call everything white supremacy, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7399.700000000001s)]
*  which is a real problem because there's actual white supremacy out there. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7401.74s)]
*  And when you call everything white supremacist, [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7405.34s)]
*  just somebody disagreeing or having a different beliefs, [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7407.54s)]
*  watching a video of a fucking crazy professor who was saying that marriage is [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7409.38s)]
*  white supremacist. It's the craziest video of all time. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7413.98s)]
*  There's an undercover video where they, [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7417.66s)]
*  they interviewed this lady and she was asking her questions and she didn't know [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7419.34s)]
*  she was being recorded. She was a professor. Yeah. Like marriage is thin privilege. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7423.54s)]
*  It's white supremacy. It's, you know, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7428.7s)]
*  male privilege which leads to white supremacy and white privilege and like just [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7431.22s)]
*  a bunch of gobbly gook nonsense words that she was attaching to just people [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7435.9s)]
*  getting married. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7440.62s)]
*  Clearly she's not a Christ follower because if you follow the Bible, [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7441.54s)]
*  it lays out what marriage is. Yeah. Well, she's definitely not. She's a kook, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7445.26s)]
*  but it's the problem is calling everything white supremacy. It kind of, [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7448.58s)]
*  it obscures the fact that there's really people like the people that you're [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7453.98s)]
*  running into the real. Yeah. And it's just like, how many of them and where are [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7457.02s)]
*  they? [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7462.14s)]
*  Thousands of thousands. Yeah. I'd say I don't know about hundreds of thousands, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7465.820000000001s)]
*  but thousands because a lot of times if you're in that community and you're [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7468.700000000001s)]
*  looking, let's say this is a telegram channel over here and it's terror wave or [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7472.860000000001s)]
*  whatever it is before it was taken down and you see all these monikers like I [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7476.620000000001s)]
*  was pale horse in the base. I was pale horse. That was my moniker. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7480.700000000001s)]
*  And then you see pestilence and you see TMB, the militant Buddhist, [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7484.259999999999s)]
*  and you see helter skelter and you say, well, you might go to another group. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7487.7s)]
*  Maybe they've changed their moniker, but you start realizing, Hey, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7492.459999999999s)]
*  did you used to be pestilence and the other channel? Yeah, that's me. All right. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7496.299999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? But what's scary is like in that base case, [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7499.259999999999s)]
*  as I said before, I'm a tactical instructor, firearms instructor. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7508.339999999999s)]
*  I'm an alert instructor, which is right near where we're at right now. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7511.0599999999995s)]
*  In San Marcos, Texas. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7514.66s)]
*  And, but you can't go undercover and help these, [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7517.379999999999s)]
*  help these guys train or help them get better because they might be doing bad [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7522.459999999999s)]
*  things. So I go in, I had my whole backstory, former skinhead, [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7528.179999999999s)]
*  former biker. And my skill set was like hand to hand combat. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7532.94s)]
*  Could I shoot? Yeah, but I let them lead me. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7537.54s)]
*  We went out there and the first time we did tactical and firearms training, [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7540.22s)]
*  it was led by a 19 year old kid and it was good. It was good. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7544.78s)]
*  And he's not military. And I'm like, I'm watching, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7549.18s)]
*  I'm like, where the hell did you learn this? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7551.78s)]
*  So a lot of stuff happens on gaming systems because they're so realistic now. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7553.1s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. I mean, these kids, you can go on and if you got your mic on, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7557.14s)]
*  you might get your butt handed to you by an 11 year old kid who's telling you to [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7560.7s)]
*  clear the hard corner and slice the pie. They're using the same verbiage. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7565.26s)]
*  And I'm like, holy crap, you know, virtual world meets real world. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7568.86s)]
*  Only problem is in the virtual world, you get to respawn. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7572.74s)]
*  Not so much in the real world, you know, I'm going to respawn now, but, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7577.46s)]
*  um, yeah, he led it and they were shooting fast and accurate. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7582.66s)]
*  They, it wasn't the best. They were mistakes. Um, [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7585.54s)]
*  but I was impressed with how safe they were. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7588.66s)]
*  The two guys running at TMB and pestilence because that was a concern for me. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7591.259999999999s)]
*  Like if you could see the aerial footage, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7595.299999999999s)]
*  like when we first go out there and they're shooting, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7597.22s)]
*  I'm way back behind them because I'm like, I don't know how these people are. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7599.18s)]
*  I've seen plenty of bad shooters, some stupid things on the line. Um, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7602.780000000001s)]
*  and then we start working like that. So I start gaining their trust, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7607.26s)]
*  do a couple of blots, uh, hikes, drinking, rucking, [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7610.9800000000005s)]
*  whatever. And then it starts, uh, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7615.42s)]
*  we're finding out a little bit more, not necessarily anything, [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7619.7s)]
*  necessarily anything criminal, uh, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7622.3s)]
*  except for the fact that there was a Canadian, um, who was part of their, [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7624.54s)]
*  basically it's like, it would be like their national guard. Um, [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7628.38s)]
*  but he got doxxed. And for the listeners that don't know doxxing, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7632.86s)]
*  basically is being outed. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7636.62s)]
*  So a lot of these accelerationist groups are big on putting up flyers and [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7638.34s)]
*  stickers. Uh, they go by and they slap up stickers everywhere, you know, [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7642.62s)]
*  join the, uh, save your race, join the base with a QR code. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7646.5s)]
*  You scan that QR code. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7649.86s)]
*  It takes you right to bit shoot to a video of us, of a propaganda, [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7651.1s)]
*  propaganda recruitment video we filmed in Georgia, [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7655.06s)]
*  of us shooting and everything. Um, and so there's one in Canada. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7658.660000000001s)]
*  He puts up flyers, somebody answers it, uh, to make, again, [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7664.740000000001s)]
*  it's more in depth in the book, but he meets this guy. Uh, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7668.54s)]
*  the guy does the same panel kind of thing I did, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7673.1s)]
*  but then he gets vetted face to face. So when you get vetted face to face, [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7675.46s)]
*  it's going to be a little bit more intense. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7679.18s)]
*  They do a face to face vetting of this guy. Uh, and he says, [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7680.900000000001s)]
*  uh, the, the punished snake was the moniker. His name is Patrick Matthews. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7686.1s)]
*  He was up there and he vetted him face to face and said, he's good to go. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7690.38s)]
*  So after about a week to two weeks tops in the main chat group, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7693.38s)]
*  this dude bails. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7698.02s)]
*  And it turns out that he was a journalist in Canada who went on his own and [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7699.54s)]
*  met Patrick, uh, [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7704.18s)]
*  Matthews and infiltrated at least to a certain degree, the base. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7706.26s)]
*  And then he puts out in a big news article up there that this guy is Patrick [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7711.62s)]
*  Matthews. And so Pat, uh, [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7715.9800000000005s)]
*  our CMP comes to his house, takes his guns. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7719.780000000001s)]
*  He gets booted from the national guard thing, loses his job. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7722.38s)]
*  His parents don't like him anymore and they, they lose him. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7726.1s)]
*  They found his truck near the border of the United States. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7730.02s)]
*  So we're all looking for him and you have to realize that on the base case, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7733.5s)]
*  let's just say you've got 40 targets where they're all over the world. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7739.3s)]
*  A lot of them in the United States. Well, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7743.02s)]
*  every one of those FBI field offices are open separate cases, [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7744.900000000001s)]
*  but we're all trying to work together because it's the same group. And, uh, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7748.3s)]
*  we get to a point to where I'm sorry, we were looking for, uh, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7753.900000000001s)]
*  Patrick Matthews and there's an unbelievable case agent. Uh, we had, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7759.139999999999s)]
*  we had several on the case, [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7763.139999999999s)]
*  but Nate Plue was running the case out of, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7764.62s)]
*  out of Seattle because the leader of the base had property in Seattle's [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7769.0599999999995s)]
*  territory. But there was a case agent named Rashid who's out of Baltimore and [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7776.099999999999s)]
*  he's running for the guys there. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7781.16s)]
*  Rashid was able to figure out by some unbelievable phone analysis. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7782.9s)]
*  Uh, when Patrick came into the United States and we're tracking, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7788.7s)]
*  we're all looking for him. We think we might know where he's at. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7794.139999999999s)]
*  And I show up at a training in North Georgia in Rome, Georgia, and he's there. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7796.7s)]
*  Uh, when I pulled up, I see vehicles and I'm counting the heads under the, [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7801.94s)]
*  under the barn and I'm like, there's one extra person. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7805.099999999999s)]
*  I know that's that person's car. And I said, well, obviously when I walk up, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7807.42s)]
*  I walk up and by then his hair had all grown out and had a red bushy beard. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7810.139999999999s)]
*  And he's like, as soon as he started talking, it was a Canadian accent. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7813.179999999999s)]
*  And I was like, Hey man, welcome to the United States, brother. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7815.9s)]
*  So now we had him there and now we're starting to find out a little bit more [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7818.94s)]
*  about death plots and this, that and the other, but is it just drunk talk? [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7822.42s)]
*  Or are they actually planning on doing something? Right. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7825.9s)]
*  And then that's when we get to the, uh, the, [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7827.98s)]
*  the big Halloween of 2019 hate camp. Um, [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7830.9s)]
*  and there was base members that came in from all over the United States. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7836.54s)]
*  Uh, and again, I've done some pagan blots with them. Like I said, [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7842.3s)]
*  you got to cut yourself. I remember the first time I did it, I was like, [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7847.14s)]
*  damn it, why didn't I bring my own knife? And uh, [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7851.02s)]
*  that when it was time to cut your finger, [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7855.3s)]
*  the tip of their knife was broken and I'm like, [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7857.54s)]
*  well I'm not going to slice my damn arm open my tats and I'm not gonna slice [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7859.42s)]
*  my finger up and I'm trying to stab my finger to bleed with a broken tip. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7862.46s)]
*  Note to self, bring your own knife next time. So I did. Uh, but we're doing, [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7866.26s)]
*  uh, Halloween we're there and I doze off. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7871.1s)]
*  We've already done hand to hand combat, some firearm stuff, [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7876.06s)]
*  had a couple of drinks and I'm charging my phone in my truck. It's really cold. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7879.26s)]
*  So I kind of doze off. I wake up to pounding on my window. Pell horse, [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7883.38s)]
*  Pell horse, you got to get up. You got to see this. You got to see this. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7887.3s)]
*  I'm like, what's going on? And they're like, man, [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7890.02s)]
*  remember us talking about a sacrifice and the goat. I'm like, yeah. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7893.06s)]
*  And they go, we got to go. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7897.1s)]
*  So I get out and there's this Ram, uh, [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7899.18s)]
*  in the back of one of the members trucks, [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7903.740000000001s)]
*  they had gone not far away to a house that had three Rams and they all dressed [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7905.860000000001s)]
*  up and I'll paint the picture for you because, uh, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7912.06s)]
*  the clothing, the, [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7917.42s)]
*  the camouflage pattern that the base war was Flecktarn cause Flecktarn pattern [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7919.26s)]
*  is German. Uh, again, how Hitler kind of stuff. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7923.700000000001s)]
*  So they went where balaclavas cover everything up. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7927.22s)]
*  They hop fences, [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7930.34s)]
*  steal this Ram and bring it back to the farm and Rome, Georgia. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7931.54s)]
*  So I wake up and I walk out there and this thing's crapping all over the bed of [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7935.700000000001s)]
*  the truck. And one of the members, pretty big fella, he says, man, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7940.46s)]
*  this thing's shitting everywhere. And I said, well, hell I would be too. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7943.700000000001s)]
*  If I just got kidnapped by a bunch of dudes and Flecktarn and balaclavas, [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7946.42s)]
*  you know? Um, so now we're kind of preparing and I'm thinking, man, [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7950.700000000001s)]
*  are we really going to do this? And I walked over to the guy. He, [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7954.860000000001s)]
*  he went by Eisen and he was going to be leading the block. And Eisen says, uh, [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7959.42s)]
*  I go over to him and I go, man, is it, [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7963.78s)]
*  is it bad that I feel sorry for the goat? And he says, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7967.02s)]
*  you can't let the goat hear you say that. And I'm like, okay, do tell. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7969.820000000001s)]
*  And he's like, uh, he goes, this is a sacrifice to Odin. This, this, [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7974.9400000000005s)]
*  this is a beautiful sacrifice. We love this Ram. We love this goat, [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7979.1s)]
*  whatever the hell it was. They, we love it and we're showing it love. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7983.72s)]
*  And it is being blessed to go to Valhalla and meet Odin. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7987.14s)]
*  So the rule was, uh, everybody leave your weapons. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7991.9800000000005s)]
*  And we're going to go down to the holy spot and deep in the woods, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7995.900000000001s)]
*  a hundred acre farm by the way. Um, [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=7999.38s)]
*  and we're walking down there and the goats just making all kinds of racket. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8002.22s)]
*  And we get down, I'm sorry, I should, let me rewind just a little bit. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8007.64s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out in my head, [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8011.34s)]
*  I'm thinking, [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8012.74s)]
*  should I do this or should I just blow the case right now? And I'm thinking, [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8014.54s)]
*  well, they said they took the goat. Okay. So that's theft of an animal. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8019.219999999999s)]
*  That's not federal. I'm like trying to go through my head. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8023.26s)]
*  So I go to my truck and I lean into one of my devices and I'm like, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8025.42s)]
*  Hey, if y'all can hear me, because when I was out in the field, I'm covered. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8030.26s)]
*  So for that four day hate camp, they were covering me 24 seven, [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8034.98s)]
*  running shifts, uh, they being law enforcement. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8039.0199999999995s)]
*  And I go and I go, Hey, if y'all can hear me, [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8043.62s)]
*  I'm pretty sure we're getting ready to go down here and sacrifice this animal. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8047.74s)]
*  And I'm running it through my brain and I know they said they stole it, [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8050.98s)]
*  but I can't come up with a good enough reason to stop this right now. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8055.66s)]
*  If you guys don't want me to do this, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8060.099999999999s)]
*  you got to send me a sign and let me know. And I waited and I waited, [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8062.98s)]
*  and it was crickets. And then I said, okay, [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8067.66s)]
*  I guess I'm going down to the woods. So we go down. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8071.34s)]
*  You had your chance. I was waiting. Oh my God. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8076.18s)]
*  So we go down to the woods and, um, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8079.46s)]
*  we get there and I don't know how I ended up at the back of the goat. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8083.46s)]
*  We're in a circle around the goat and I'm at the back of it. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8088.34s)]
*  And Isen who's leading the blot is talking about, [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8091.62s)]
*  we're going to be starting the wild hunt in Norse mythology. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8094.7s)]
*  The wild hunt is basically Odin and a bunch of other gods going out in the [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8097.34s)]
*  middle of the night and whipping the crap out every other God that they didn't [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8100.82s)]
*  like or whatever. And the twisted version of the base, [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8103.66s)]
*  starting the wild hunt was going to start with the sacrifice of this goat, [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8107.82s)]
*  which he named a Gar. His middle name was Garfield named after his grandfather, [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8111.34s)]
*  to show love to the goat. He named it Gar after his grandfather. Okay. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8115.86s)]
*  So he says, once we commit to do sacrifice and it goes to [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8121.299999999999s)]
*  Valhalla that, [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8126.179999999999s)]
*  that the wild hunt will start, [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8128.38s)]
*  but the wild hunt was going to be cleansing the world of non whites. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8130.9s)]
*  So the goat was the start of this whole wild hunt, [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8135.86s)]
*  the wild hunt. It's in North mythology. It's called the wild hunt. But again, [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8140.98s)]
*  they're twisting it right. Right. So he's got this like machete type object. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8144.26s)]
*  And I'm at the back of the goat and he's going through it. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8150.099999999999s)]
*  He says his own prayer and he didn't leave the blot in ears. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8152.74s)]
*  Good is the actual asatric priest that did it before, [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8156.66s)]
*  but he's trying and he's going back with this. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8160.42s)]
*  He's going back with this machete and I'm holding the back of the goat and [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8165.34s)]
*  somebody's holding the front of the goat and he's coming down. He's practicing, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8168.62s)]
*  practicing and he's a pretty stocky kid. And finally somebody says, just do it. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8172.54s)]
*  Man, he rears back with all of his strength and comes down right on the back of [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8176.82s)]
*  the neck of the goat. I don't even know if it broke a hair, Joe. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8181.22s)]
*  I don't know if it's because the back strap of the goat was so thick or the [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8184.18s)]
*  blade was dull, but when he hit it, all your hair was bad. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8187.42s)]
*  And I, and then for that split second, I'm holding the back of the goat and I go, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8192.14s)]
*  Oh man, I just saw blood. I just pictured something bad happening. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8195.02s)]
*  And then somebody says, has anybody got a gun? Do you hear, do it again, [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8199.14s)]
*  do it again. Am I take two swings and you're saying, I got a gun. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8202.42s)]
*  Well, I told you we weren't supposed to bring any weapons down. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8205.82s)]
*  Well, this one cat who was probably the least qualified person to be carrying a [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8208.300000000001s)]
*  firearm anywhere within miles of us said, yeah, [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8212.900000000001s)]
*  I got mine. And we were like, what are you doing with your gun? [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8216.300000000001s)]
*  So TMB takes the gun, hands it to Eisen, [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8219.820000000002s)]
*  Eisen we're still all on our knees in a circle around the goat for this [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8224.660000000002s)]
*  sacrifice. Eisen points the gun at the goat, goat's head, [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8227.58s)]
*  and then turns the opposite way. Oh Jesus. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8231.980000000001s)]
*  And that's when the instructor enemy comes out. I'm like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8234.7s)]
*  Whoa. He's like, what? I go, look at that. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8237.94s)]
*  Whoa. He's like, what? I go, look at what you're shooting at, man. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8240.54s)]
*  We're all in a circle. The hell are you doing? [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8244.54s)]
*  So then he chambers around and gets up close. Pow. Even on recording, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8247.820000000002s)]
*  you hear the goat hit the ground. Well, sitting there twitching. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8251.42s)]
*  It's been like two, three minutes. It's still twitching. And I'm like, Hey, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8255.060000000001s)]
*  why don't you go put another bullet in the ram? He's like, [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8260.34s)]
*  Oh, I think it's dead. And I go, I'm just saying for the love of the goat. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8265.220000000001s)]
*  And it being happy in Valhalla, [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8269.62s)]
*  let's give it a good clean kill. I'm trying to use this logic. Yeah. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8273.54s)]
*  And he puts another one in it and then somebody says, yeah, it's definitely dead. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8277.820000000002s)]
*  So you think it's over? No, it's not over. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8281.34s)]
*  Now they slice the goat's throat and fill a cup with all of his blood. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8283.34s)]
*  And one of the guys had brought a sheet of acid. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8288.42s)]
*  Eisen had brought a sheet of acid. Oh boy. Yeah. Right. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8291.460000000001s)]
*  It's supposed to help with the Shaman, [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8294.74s)]
*  which is kind of entering the spirit world during your block. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8296.14s)]
*  You're going to get high. And I'm shining the light cause it's pitch dark. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8300.939999999999s)]
*  We're in the middle of the woods and I'm shining the light for Eisen. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8305.34s)]
*  He's going around and what's happening is, is he's tearing off a tab. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8308.14s)]
*  Not everybody did it. Of course I didn't do it, but he tears off a tab, [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8311.58s)]
*  puts it under a tongue. Some people never even done it before. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8315.18s)]
*  And then you chase it down with the blood of the goat. Oh, part of the sacrifice. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8317.619999999999s)]
*  So he gets around. Some people do it. Most people do it. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8321.74s)]
*  A couple of us didn't. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8325.1s)]
*  And then it gets to me and I'm looking at the cup full of blood. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8328.42s)]
*  And by the time, by this time it's coagulating, it's all clotty. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8333.1s)]
*  And I'm looking at it and I'm like, Oh man, I do not want to turn that up. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8337.14s)]
*  I really don't want to turn it up. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8342.22s)]
*  And I think it was pestilence to give me an out. He's man, you can just taste. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8344.18s)]
*  So I stuck my finger all the way down in the blood, pulled it out, [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8348.26s)]
*  sucked all the blood off my finger. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8351.46s)]
*  And that was my way of dealing with the sacrifice. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8353.460000000001s)]
*  Not exactly fear factor stuff, [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8356.060000000001s)]
*  but I would have sucked. I would have been good on that show, [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8359.78s)]
*  except for the gross stuff. But yeah, but disgusting. So over the next, [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8361.9s)]
*  actually the next day of training was completely obliterated because everybody, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8366.58s)]
*  90% of the members were all still high, been up all night on acid. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8371.02s)]
*  So we couldn't train the next day. And I was pissed. I told him, [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8374.86s)]
*  like, this is a wasted fricking day. I said, you sons of, you know, [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8377.42s)]
*  I'm just giving him a hard time. And then by Saturday we were back training again. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8380.66s)]
*  And then by Sunday night, I'm sorry, Friday, we were training again. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8385.5s)]
*  And by Saturday night we did a bunch more training through the day, [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8389.1s)]
*  like, you know, navigating the land, living off the, [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8394.46s)]
*  living off the land, building bunkers and stuff like that. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8398.3s)]
*  And then it's time to shoot some more for the propaganda video. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8403.58s)]
*  So we go back down in the woods and at this, [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8408.34s)]
*  now we're doing a bonfire at the holy spot and we are burning American flags and [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8411.38s)]
*  we're burning holy Bibles. While everybody's yelling, F you're Jewish God, [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8417.42s)]
*  death to America, stuff like that. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8423.82s)]
*  And I remember the one kid that was pretty clumsy. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8426.5s)]
*  He almost fell in the fire trying to light the flag on fire. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8429.86s)]
*  And in the video you can see me grab the other side. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8432.74s)]
*  Part of me wanted to just let him fall. You know, just seeing him go, [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8436.179999999998s)]
*  I don't know if he didn't want up in flames or not, but a little Darwinism. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8439.98s)]
*  But I hold the flag, we burned the American flag. We're screaming all that. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8443.22s)]
*  And they take, they take a holy Bibles and they, [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8446.779999999999s)]
*  this is on the video. They lay them face down in the fire and I watched the fire [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8451.58s)]
*  go up. It's coming back down. We've been there a minute. Hell yeah. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8456.34s)]
*  High five and white power, all this stuff. And it's coming back down. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8460.859999999999s)]
*  And if you've ever seen like a, like a book in a fire, [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8464.86s)]
*  all this pages, they get that, it just, it looks a certain way, kind of ashy. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8469.58s)]
*  Well, the one guy, the Canadian guy, he, he, [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8474.34s)]
*  he can't not screw with the fire. He's over there. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8477.82s)]
*  He's probably still got acidity system. Who knows? He's still poking the fire. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8480.14s)]
*  Like, Oh, so he's stoking it back up. Well, while he's trying to stoke it back up, [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8482.86s)]
*  he flips something over a Bible opens face up and there's nothing burn on it at [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8487.58s)]
*  all. Like the outside's charred, but there's not a single page burnt. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8492.5s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, that's different. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8499.26s)]
*  So he's trying to get it started. He, he starts tearing page by page, [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8503.42s)]
*  gets it on fire. Bonfire goes back up. We're all doing our thing. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8506.42s)]
*  Bonfire comes back down. He's poking the coals again. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8510.34s)]
*  I'll be damned if another Bible doesn't flip open completely unburned. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8513.26s)]
*  And I watched them put it on that face first. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8517.42s)]
*  Now I know some people with science and they're like, well, [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8520.06s)]
*  and a lot of Bibles, the page is made out of clay and they don't burn. Listen, [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8522.619999999999s)]
*  I watched a flag burn. I watched all that stuff burn. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8526.539999999999s)]
*  And I actually have a picture that if you blow it up, I didn't realize it. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8529.94s)]
*  I was just taking pictures like everybody else was taking pictures, [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8533.66s)]
*  but I was in my hotel room one night just going through my pictures and I blew it [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8536.26s)]
*  up and you can clearly see Holy Bible in the flames. So I'm a believer. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8539.9s)]
*  My faith is huge throughout the book. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8546.34s)]
*  I would not have been able to do any of it in my opinion. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8548.5s)]
*  But I remember when that second Bible flipped over and one of the, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8553.339999999998s)]
*  one of the base members goes, he goes, man, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8557.339999999998s)]
*  these f*****g Bibles just won't burn. And I remember I did it very nonchalantly, [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8560.179999999998s)]
*  maybe only in my head, but I did a little Sammy Sosa, you know, to the sky, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8564.9s)]
*  you know, I'm like, yeah, you get them Lord. Yeah. I'm like, yeah, that's funny. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8568.8s)]
*  By the way, if you want to blow everybody up, y'all just let Scotty know, [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8573.259999999998s)]
*  and I'll be real still right now. But yeah. So after that week, [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8576.1s)]
*  I kind of said, I got a pretty dumb sense of humor, [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8580.220000000001s)]
*  but I got back to the office and I said, man, [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8583.58s)]
*  I've been doing undercover work off and on since 1996. And I said, [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8586.140000000001s)]
*  I don't know my skillset takes me to different places and other people. I said, [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8589.560000000001s)]
*  but I have never had to burn Bibles, [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8592.26s)]
*  burn an American flag and I damn sure wasn't with a group of people that went out [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8596.220000000001s)]
*  and stole a goat and sacrificed it at a pagan ritual and drank his blood. I said, [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8599.9s)]
*  I've done that in three days with these guys. And I mean, I felt weird. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8604.26s)]
*  I felt weird when I got back. I just, you know, I call, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8608.1s)]
*  I even texted my pastor. I'm like, I need you to say a prayer. I just, [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8610.86s)]
*  I don't know, dirty something. Yeah. I felt weird. You know, [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8614.94s)]
*  which is weird that guys like that exist and organize and find other guys like [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8618.26s)]
*  that and get together. It's all mine. It's this phone. Listen, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8622.02s)]
*  a lot of these kids were young. Um, I say kids, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8626.18s)]
*  cause I, I, it was the first alias I ever did where I made myself younger. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8630.380000000001s)]
*  My whole FBI career, I was always two years older. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8634.54s)]
*  It was just easy to remember. Uh, I mean, I turned 40 with the outlaws. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8638.18s)]
*  So when I turned 42 years later in real life and I'm in my, [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8642.62s)]
*  wherever I was at my calendar or Tennessee, I'm like, yeah, [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8645.66s)]
*  my other party was a little better. I'm not gonna lie. I'm like, you know, [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8649.26s)]
*  the outlaws party was, I mean, thank you guys for throwing me a party, [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8652.78s)]
*  but this is not really nothing compared to when I turned 42 years ago. Um, [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8655.78s)]
*  but for the base, [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8659.46s)]
*  I had to hustle and get in there fast because we were getting calls from world [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8660.699999999999s)]
*  working partners because again, this is online. You hop in those groups, [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8664.74s)]
*  there's people from South Africa, uh, Australia, UK, Norway, [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8669.58s)]
*  you name it. And they're all because it's online. Now, [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8675.14s)]
*  they may not be able to get weapons like we got weapons, [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8677.82s)]
*  but they were even planning on flying into the States and doing some hate [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8680.14s)]
*  crime. I mean, well, I'm sure we'd be doing hate crimes, but a hate camp. Um, [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8682.82s)]
*  but they dive in and what I saw a lot of is younger, [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8687.22s)]
*  younger guys, um, outcasts, uh, [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8692.099999999999s)]
*  don't have a job, can't get a partner, you know, [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8697.22s)]
*  and they just dive down this rabbit hole. They've probably been bullied, [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8701.66s)]
*  um, and they dive down this rabbit hole of hate. And it's always, [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8707.06s)]
*  it seems like it goes back to like gangs and cults and stuff like that. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8710.22s)]
*  They're trying, it's that need to belong and they want to bring you in. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8713.14s)]
*  And that's how they get you. Um, and then power and then, [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8716.78s)]
*  and being inclusive, having, having people with your own like mind, [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8720.5s)]
*  but that's not just on the white supremacy side. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8724.66s)]
*  Same thing's happening on the Islamic radical Islamist side. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8726.54s)]
*  Yeah. They're, uh, radicalizing you online and endating you with videos. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8730.7s)]
*  You could go into gab. I don't even have gab still around, [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8735.78s)]
*  but you could go into gab and there would be a group called 14 words. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8737.86s)]
*  Well, that's the 14 words coined by David Lane. It is, [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8740.94s)]
*  it is famous in the white supremacy culture. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8743.820000000002s)]
*  It says something to the if I don't have it memorized anymore. Uh, [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8746.740000000002s)]
*  as I say a lot of times when I'm speaking, I go, Hey, uh, just so you guys know, [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8749.66s)]
*  I appreciate the questions, but since I retired, [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8752.94s)]
*  I made a conscious decision not to hang out with white supremacists anymore. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8755.02s)]
*  Probably a good decision. I mean, I appreciate you asking me, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8760.42s)]
*  but were they the wackiest people that you were around? [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8763.02s)]
*  It's going to be close. It's obviously the pedophiles are the most, [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8767.820000000002s)]
*  well, yeah, but it's going to be close, but [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8770.94s)]
*  the, [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8773.820000000002s)]
*  I don't want to say I'm not easily shocked. It's just that, uh, I mean, [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8777.54s)]
*  you see so much stuff. It's, it's like, again, it's that proverbial, [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8781.220000000001s)]
*  uh, coroner who shows up eating a sandwich where brains are everywhere because [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8787.02s)]
*  they've seen them, they got to eat, you know, they're just used to it. Um, [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8790.220000000001s)]
*  so there's, there's definitely been some wacky things. I mean, [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8794.86s)]
*  on the case agent side, that stuff on the border was pretty wacky, [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8797.66s)]
*  but undercover wise, um, [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8800.86s)]
*  these guys, I mean, they were, I don't know about calling them wacky, [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8803.740000000002s)]
*  but just they were planted. I mean, we, what we did is we uncovered violent, [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8807.820000000002s)]
*  we uncovered several murder plots. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8811.7s)]
*  They had found a couple that they believe were an, uh, uh, Antifa couple, [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8813.900000000001s)]
*  a couple of counties over in, in Georgia. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8818.34s)]
*  And we went and cased the place. The idea was it started, [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8821.5s)]
*  it took, it took a while to come to fruition because it changed a couple of [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8827.54s)]
*  times. But essentially what was agreed upon is that, [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8830.54s)]
*  we were all going to be the Georgia sale. When I say sale, it's C E L L, [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8833.820000000002s)]
*  which by the way, it's probably a good time to say the base, uh, [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8838.18s)]
*  in Arabic is Al Qaeda. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8842.060000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8844.380000000001s)]
*  So Al Qaeda wanted to have three to five man sales, [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8846.18s)]
*  C E L L. I know I got a redneck accent, um, [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8850.7s)]
*  sales all over the world waiting on that D day call. Well, [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8853.86s)]
*  the base, which stands for Al Qaeda, [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8858.380000000001s)]
*  wanted three to five man sales all over the world waiting for the Boogaloo. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8861.02s)]
*  You got kids, 21 year old has no car, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8865.42s)]
*  has no job, but has an arsenal in his closet. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8870.58s)]
*  He's wearing plate carriers or the same plate carriers that FBI SWAT team [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8874.58s)]
*  wears. It's not cheap stuff. And however, they're getting their money, [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8878.02s)]
*  either from parents or whatever they're doing, [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8882.22s)]
*  they are building their kit for what they refer to as the day, [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8884.06s)]
*  the set off of the race war. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8887.94s)]
*  So we uncovered those murder plots. Um, I remember Helter Skelter, [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8890.3s)]
*  we got the postponement because once we figured out they were trying to kill [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8895.66s)]
*  people, man, we got to slow this thing down and make sure we've got control of [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8898.259999999998s)]
*  it. Much like a murder for hire. If you're hiring me to kill somebody, [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8901.46s)]
*  I want to make sure that I got the contract. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8904.5s)]
*  So you're not out trying to find somebody else to kill this person. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8906.3s)]
*  So, uh, we were riding out there and, uh, [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8909.259999999998s)]
*  Helter had not seen the house yet. And, and Helter, [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8914.539999999999s)]
*  I'll take the plan in a second. Helter, we're riding out there and Helter goes, [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8918.42s)]
*  Hey, uh, uh, if you don't mind, man, [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8921.300000000001s)]
*  I'd really like to pop my cherry on this one. Well, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8924.82s)]
*  you and I here pop my cherry. It probably means something different. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8927.980000000001s)]
*  Cause I was like, what are you talking about? And then, uh, Luke TMB told me, [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8931.18s)]
*  he goes, I think he actually wants to participate in the killing. And he said, [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8935.980000000001s)]
*  man, I've been waiting for this for two years. He goes, I actually want to be, [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8939.94s)]
*  I want to put one of the bullets in their head. And I said, well, it's a 22, [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8942.460000000001s)]
*  25, whatever with the silencer on it. It may take more than one. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8945.62s)]
*  Shouldn't be a big deal. But the idea was, and this is how much, [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8948.539999999999s)]
*  this is how much research was done. We're going to go to a campsite. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8951.38s)]
*  We're going to leave everything electronic there. We're going to leave from there. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8956.22s)]
*  We're going to have a car that doesn't come back to the back, rental car, [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8959.26s)]
*  whatever fake plates, whatever. We're going to go to a pay by the hour hotel, [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8962.62s)]
*  motel. We're going to go there. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8966.78s)]
*  We're going to scrub and scrub and wash and wash to get any flakes of skin that [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8968.3s)]
*  may be loose to come off as detailed as Vaseline on your eyebrows, [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8973.04s)]
*  facial hair. So you don't drop any kind of DNA tape up kind of like WMD. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8978.72s)]
*  We're going to tape our jacket to our gloves, our pants to our boots. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8983.36s)]
*  So nothing can leak out. He had, Luke had even done so much research. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8987.4s)]
*  He had read that a lot of people who, [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8991.48s)]
*  who kill somebody for the first time lose control of their bowels. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8993.64s)]
*  So he was suggesting we all wear depends while we go commit the murder. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=8997.16s)]
*  I didn't tell him I'd ever killed anybody, but I looked at him and said, [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9002.08s)]
*  I think I'm okay. I don't need to wear depends. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9004.36s)]
*  So that was the thing. And then we were going to go into the house, [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9009.0s)]
*  a breach our way in murder, whoever's there. Because it was like, [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9012.24s)]
*  are there any kids there? Helter's like, [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9016.76s)]
*  I don't have a problem killing the comic kid. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9018.52s)]
*  Now Helter kind of looked like a normal guy, had a computer IT job. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9020.52s)]
*  He said that was a great cover for him because everybody thinks he's just a [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9024.560000000001s)]
*  normal person in society. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9027.76s)]
*  This is a guy who also told me, he said, again, [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9031.6s)]
*  they want to accelerate the downfall. This guy told me, he said, [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9035.36s)]
*  I voted for Hillary Clinton. And I was like, I'm in here with Neo Nazis. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9039.44s)]
*  And it threw me off guard. I'm like, why, why would you do that? And he goes, [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9043.640000000001s)]
*  think about it, bro. He said, [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9047.12s)]
*  we want to accelerate the collapse of society. He goes, if she gets in, [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9050.640000000001s)]
*  they usually try to defund the police. They make our military weaker. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9054.480000000001s)]
*  There's going to be riots. There's going to be all this stuff. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9058.16s)]
*  And there's just going to be chaos. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9060.800000000001s)]
*  It'll help speed up the downfall of society. Wow. That's how, [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9062.6s)]
*  that's what they're thinking is. So we're got that murder plot going on. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9066.32s)]
*  And then you have the Canadian guy and his cell up in a, actually, [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9070.92s)]
*  it was, it would have been, can't go back, which is Brian Lemley. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9075.84s)]
*  They had a cell up in the Maryland area and I went up and I, [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9081.04s)]
*  I trained with them and they, at that point in time, [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9085.6s)]
*  so it would have been coming up to January of 2020, [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9090.16s)]
*  there was going to be a huge second amendment rally in Virginia because the [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9093.88s)]
*  governor at the time was pretty liberal, did not like guns, [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9097.4s)]
*  and was going to be making a lot of, was trying to crack down on guns, [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9101.0s)]
*  second amendment. So the idea of those base members was, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9104.92s)]
*  what if that's the set off of the Boogaloo? What if, [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9109.16s)]
*  while all those people are there, you've got three percenters, [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9111.44s)]
*  which is not illegal. You got militia, which is not illegal, [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9114.32s)]
*  but you've got people wanting to do nefarious things. Most likely. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9116.72s)]
*  You've got cops. What if we just pop a couple of rounds? [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9119.68s)]
*  Nobody knows who's shooting at who and everybody, [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9122.08s)]
*  and maybe that's the kickoff of the Boogaloo. Again, [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9124.44s)]
*  there's not a lot of forethought and afterthought with these guys. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9128.96s)]
*  It's like, what do you, what about the national? I mean, what about army, Navy, [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9131.88s)]
*  Air Force, Marine? What about fricking cops? You know, we'll deal with it. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9135.4s)]
*  What about girlfriends? I ask them, I go, you know, [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9139.16s)]
*  I hear you guys talking about procreation all the time. I don't see any women. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9141.119999999999s)]
*  I got a woman, she's not for share. And they're like, Oh, we're just rape them. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9144.08s)]
*  And I go, I'm sorry. Sorry. What? Because yeah, [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9148.8s)]
*  we're just going to rape the women on when D-Day happens and it's the Boogaloo. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9151.48s)]
*  Yeah, we're just going to take the women and rape them. I kind of giggled. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9154.32s)]
*  And I said, you guys don't have a lot of experience with women, do you? [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9157.16s)]
*  And they're like, wow. And I go, well, that stuff might work for a little while, [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9162.32s)]
*  but sooner or later you're going to have to go to sleep. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9166.36s)]
*  You might wake up missing some parts you went to bed with. I'm like, [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9168.28s)]
*  what are you talking about? [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9170.960000000001s)]
*  But we uncovered all that and we got enough evidence against them that everybody [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9172.8s)]
*  was happy. And, uh, the week of the takedown, uh, I'm sorry. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9177.4s)]
*  Yeah, it would have been close to the week of the takedown. I had to postpone it. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9183.08s)]
*  Uh, I had a lumbar fusion in 2002. What I didn't know. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9186.24s)]
*  I thought it was just my disc, a bulging disc or something. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9190.199999999999s)]
*  What I didn't know is that fusion had broken free. And for about 15 years, [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9193.0s)]
*  I just had nothing. I had no disc, the cadaver bone dissipated. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9197.4s)]
*  So my back was spasming really, really bad. Like I couldn't get out of the floor. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9200.92s)]
*  So, uh, I took some prednisone, got off the floor with electric stem. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9205.279999999999s)]
*  Uh, I just had to, we had to postpone it for a week. So then I went. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9211.16s)]
*  And on a Friday I flew into Baltimore, uh, [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9214.039999999999s)]
*  met the case team drove up Saturday to Delaware, [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9218.519999999999s)]
*  trained all day with those guys, um, [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9222.519999999999s)]
*  help get more information that everybody wanted. Uh, [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9225.64s)]
*  came back late to Baltimore, flew to Atlanta, [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9229.039999999999s)]
*  drove up to try to close the deal with, uh, the Georgia crew. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9232.76s)]
*  And I think I got home Monday for a couple of hours. I went back. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9237.92s)]
*  Now I'm meeting with the SWAT teams cause we're planning on the takedown. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9241.76s)]
*  And by Wednesday I picked up Luke who lived on the a hundred acre [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9244.880000000001s)]
*  farm and we did a ruse where the car, uh, [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9249.76s)]
*  like my car was messed up. I'm like, did you hear that? Actually, [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9253.6s)]
*  more divine intervention. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9256.76s)]
*  I was going to fake that something was wrong with my car and my truck. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9257.800000000001s)]
*  We're driving all of a sudden. So it goes bam like that. And I go, [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9260.36s)]
*  I didn't run over anything. I go, did you hear that? He said, yes. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9263.68s)]
*  I swear if that damn brake caliper froze again, I said, let me pull over. Well, [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9266.76s)]
*  I pulled over to the spot SWAT team wanted me to. And then we did a ruse. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9270.6s)]
*  I was, I was around the back of the truck looking and another truck pulls up. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9274.16s)]
*  I'm like, Oh my gosh, man, I can't believe you're here. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9277.44s)]
*  And then I jumped in that truck and then the SWAT team and the bear cats rolling [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9279.52s)]
*  over the hill and they took him without incident. Uh, helter skelter, [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9282.76s)]
*  and pestilence got picked up without incident. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9286.48s)]
*  We kept all that quiet on Wednesday because come Thursday morning SWAT teams [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9289.0s)]
*  from Washington field office and Baltimore field office were going to be hitting [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9293.48s)]
*  that crew. So we wanted to keep it quiet. So now Thursday, they get arrested. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9297.199999999999s)]
*  Now stuff's starting to come out. I'm still in a chat group and Friday, [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9302.039999999999s)]
*  um, I'm watching it and they're like, pale horse, are you there? [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9306.8s)]
*  And they're like, wait a minute. Now the affidavits are starting to come out. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9310.48s)]
*  It says that it says that there's a federal undercover agent that infiltrated [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9312.64s)]
*  the base. And they're like, who's a damn fed in here? And I'm just being quiet. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9315.84s)]
*  And, uh, somewhere around five 15, the leader of the base, [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9319.72s)]
*  he went by the monikers, Norman Spears and Roman Wolf. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9323.84s)]
*  His real name is Ronaldo Nazaro. So you can let this sink in. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9326.68s)]
*  Here's an American citizen born in America, went to Villanova, [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9330.64s)]
*  was in the army to my understanding army Intel. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9334.76s)]
*  And he was contracted at some point for some job in the department of justice. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9339.04s)]
*  Uh, now resides in St. Petersburg, Russia. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9344.039999999999s)]
*  And I guess he supposedly teaches English. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9347.56s)]
*  They tried to say the base didn't have a leader. He's definitely the leader. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9350.48s)]
*  And, uh, as a Russian family, so you can do your own speculation there. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9354.8s)]
*  I'm not working that case anymore. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9360.08s)]
*  How fucking crazy. Right? What was his red pill moment? [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9361.76s)]
*  Cause clearly if you look at his history, he was kind of on the liberal side, [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9365.08s)]
*  something happened somewhere and then he starts spewing crazy stuff. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9368.439999999999s)]
*  And then the base gets infiltrated by like journalists from vice. Well, [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9371.88s)]
*  then they tight. Now, every time the base got infiltrated, [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9375.92s)]
*  they tighten their op sec more and more. Every propaganda video we did, [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9378.48s)]
*  the rule was it has to be better than the last one because we're trying to get [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9382.48s)]
*  everybody. And so I'm watching all this rollout. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9386.16s)]
*  There's no way of feds in here, this, that, and the other blah, blah, blah. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9390.32s)]
*  And then I see Roman finally respond around like five ish on Friday. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9393.24s)]
*  And he's like, I'm not sure we could have found him. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9397.119999999999s)]
*  Cause he was good. Uh, he attended every meeting, which I didn't. He said, [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9401.439999999999s)]
*  he attended every meeting, which maybe that should have been a red flag, [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9405.96s)]
*  but I didn't attend every training or meeting. Um, and I'm like, okay, [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9408.199999999999s)]
*  he's figured out it's me. And then he said something else. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9412.199999999999s)]
*  And then that was it. It says, boom, you've been removed by Roman Wolf. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9414.68s)]
*  So I screenshotted that and I sent it to all the case teams all over the United [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9418.0s)]
*  States and the headquarters FBI. And I said, and I'm out. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9421.64s)]
*  Yeah. So they went down. That was, uh, that was a wild case. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9426.64s)]
*  And if you want to get into like the effects on family and stuff at that point, [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9430.8s)]
*  I mean, we're talking 2020. I started in 96 at a state and local level, [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9435.84s)]
*  but my wife, we were dating when I was an arc. So she was kind of used to, Hey, [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9440.199999999999s)]
*  I went out and picked up some hookers and got some cocaine stuff. But, um, [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9444.64s)]
*  clearly there were some very rough times, uh, [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9448.8s)]
*  especially during that three year period around the outlaws. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9451.119999999999s)]
*  But it's not always easy, but what she says, cause people always ask. And, [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9454.119999999999s)]
*  and the spouses do not get enough credit at all. She's not law enforcement. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9458.68s)]
*  She's not desensitized in my world. Um, [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9463.56s)]
*  she used to freak out and be nervous when I'd go on under covers. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9466.96s)]
*  And what she would do is to help her cook. She moved furniture. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9471.039999999999s)]
*  I'd come home and open the door and trip over stuff. I'm like, what in the, [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9475.88s)]
*  how did the couch get, who moved that refrigerator? You know, crazy stuff. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9479.96s)]
*  But one day, uh, what she said is she said, look, [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9485.24s)]
*  she just had to give it up to God. She's like, [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9488.04s)]
*  I can sit here and worry every day and I'm going to, [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9490.32s)]
*  I'm going to kill myself worrying about it. But I essentially don't have control. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9492.8s)]
*  Uh, I gotta pray that you're good at what you do. And, uh, and, and, you know, [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9497.84s)]
*  if it's your time to go, he can take me anytime he wants. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9502.36s)]
*  But finishing the base case is the first time like an idiot, [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9505.48s)]
*  I should have realized it. But I realized after an undercover, [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9508.64s)]
*  I have to decompress. I have to kind of, okay, all right. I get my mind. All right. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9512.400000000001s)]
*  That's done. Okay. So does she. And we were sitting out on the back porch, [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9517.04s)]
*  having a, having an adult beverage. I might've been smoking a cigar, [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9522.880000000001s)]
*  but she said something to the effect of, uh, [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9527.400000000001s)]
*  what something I was at the base and she was like, yeah, [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9530.480000000001s)]
*  I was covering you in prayer. And I kind of giggled and she's like, [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9533.12s)]
*  she looks at me and I'm like, what? I mean, we've been doing this for a while. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9538.2s)]
*  Right? I mean, you don't, you don't have to like be worried about me, [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9541.64s)]
*  worried about me. We've been doing this a minute. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9545.16s)]
*  She jerked a knot in my butt, man. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9547.64s)]
*  And she looked at me and stern and she said, let me tell you something. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9549.119999999999s)]
*  You were my husband and I'm your wife and it's my job to cover you. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9552.08s)]
*  And when you're going on these things, I'm covering you. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9556.56s)]
*  And I stopped smiling and I said, I greatly appreciate that. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9559.519999999999s)]
*  And I'm sorry if I insulted you, but thank you. Wow. Craziness. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9563.599999999999s)]

*  So murder for hire basically. Oh, it was, uh, [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9583.12s)]
*  I got hired to do me and another task force officer who went with me on the [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9585.800000000001s)]
*  undercover. Essentially they thought we were bikers and they ended up hiring us [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9589.84s)]
*  to do four home invasions and murder two people. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9593.32s)]
*  So you want to talk about wacky people. This is towards the end of my career. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9595.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Her name was Tammy. She gets in, it's all in the news and the court records. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9598.640000000001s)]
*  Uh, we go and we meet the husband. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9605.28s)]
*  We thought the husband was the one wanting to get us and we were like off a [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9607.2s)]
*  dirt road. It's pretty rough, man. Like, I like walking up to the place. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9610.0s)]

*  Oh, that's really not my plan. It's my old lady's plan. Okay. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9623.12s)]
*  Where's your old lady? Well, she's asleep. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9625.6s)]
*  We're going to wake her up. You want me to, [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9627.880000000001s)]
*  I didn't drive all the way out here to talk to you. If you're not planning it, [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9630.880000000001s)]
*  I'm here to make money. So we pick her up. She comes out, gets in the truck. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9633.720000000001s)]
*  We start driving around, [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9637.480000000001s)]
*  looking at these locations of where they wanted it because they knew some people [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9638.32s)]
*  that were dealing dope. They had the ends on where the guns and the money were. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9641.84s)]
*  So they thought, [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9644.84s)]
*  and they wanted us to do the home invasions and kill them. Um, [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9647.04s)]
*  but while we're riding around, she says, uh, if you need somebody tortured, [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9651.6s)]
*  I'm really good in torture. I love torture. I'm driving. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9655.640000000001s)]
*  She's in the passenger seat, clawing herself. She's weathered. Yeah. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9659.84s)]
*  She's weathered, tweaking probably. And uh, [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9663.68s)]
*  this is how my mind works. So she's, she's like, yeah, I'm into torture. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9668.92s)]
*  She goes, you know, [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9672.4s)]
*  that you can take a hanger and bend it on the end and shove it up a man's penis [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9673.76s)]
*  and rip it back out and then pour salt in the penis. Well, [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9677.6s)]
*  now the guys in the back of the truck are going, Oh my gosh. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9680.56s)]
*  What she didn't know was two weeks prior to that, [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9683.52s)]
*  I had my second lumbar fusion, which fixed my first lumbar fusion. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9685.36s)]
*  That wasn't the problem. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9690.44s)]
*  They messed up my privates and they had to dry cath me. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9691.720000000001s)]
*  So when she's talking about this hanger going in and out, I'm kind of feeling, [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9694.34s)]
*  I'm like, I think I know what the similar to that. Um, [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9697.960000000001s)]
*  so she says that and then she says, yeah, [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9703.480000000001s)]
*  and you can take a PVC pipe and you can run it up somebody's anus and then run [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9704.92s)]
*  barbed wire up it and rip it out. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9708.62s)]
*  And I, we pull up to a red light and I leaned over and I go, [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9710.28s)]
*  why are you so angry? And she's like, Oh no, I said, [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9714.6s)]
*  are you sure you don't want to kill these people? She's like, Oh no, [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9717.6s)]
*  I'm too well known, but if you need somebody tortured, I can do it. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9720.0s)]
*  Then on the next ride or the ride into the next place, [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9722.720000000001s)]
*  she says that her husband went on a cocaine bender and she told him never to do [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9725.08s)]
*  that again. Cocaine meth something. Uh, she said cocaine, [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9729.6s)]
*  but he had been gone for three days. She couldn't find him. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9732.880000000001s)]
*  He comes home after being high three, four days and he crashes. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9735.24s)]
*  She's so pissed at him. She tells us the story that he's naked. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9738.880000000001s)]
*  She takes a two by four, shoves it under his back legs, [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9742.4s)]
*  takes an industrial stapler and staples his scrotum to the board. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9744.800000000001s)]
*  He didn't wake up. That's how, that's how down he was or his crash was. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9749.68s)]
*  But when he did, [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9753.16s)]
*  he finds himself hooked to a board and he's screaming for help and she wouldn't [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9754.72s)]
*  help him. He had to call a friend to do it. So if you think the story's BS, [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9758.44s)]
*  if you think the story's BS, we confirmed it with the husband. He's like, Oh, [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9762.72s)]
*  yeah, yeah, she did it. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9767.56s)]
*  I ain't never had no woman do nothing like that to me before. And I'm like, [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9768.4s)]
*  so my buddy in the back, he goes, uh, you really don't like men, do you? [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9773.92s)]
*  And she's like, I've been unlucky in love, but in my head, Joe, [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9777.96s)]
*  that's when I'm looking over and I go, these are my people. This is my skill set. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9781.199999999999s)]
*  This is what I get. I don't get, I don't get wall street. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9785.64s)]
*  Jesus Christ. So yeah, it's all kinds of stuff like that, man. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9790.72s)]
*  God damn. That's a crazy life, brother. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9794.0s)]
*  Yep. So now, now it's book. Uh, I still teach alert. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9796.92s)]

*  but it's not just white supremacy. It's got the outlaws. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9808.279999999999s)]

*  corner, I, I underestimated. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9825.640000000001s)]
*  I'm dealing with a guy who's toothless and a mountain backwards guy. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9828.44s)]
*  And he beat me at chess that night. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9833.04s)]
*  And I ended up with a bag of cocaine open shoved in my face. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9835.400000000001s)]
*  He's got a sawed off shotgun, a red bone hounds growling in my crotch. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9839.12s)]
*  And he's like, if I find out you the law, you're dead, man, do it. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9842.28s)]
*  If you're not a cop, I had to figure out a way to get out of that, you know? [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9845.0s)]
*  There's stuff like that all in there. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9849.640000000001s)]

*  That's part of your skill set. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9855.320000000002s)]
*  And when they sent, when somebody sent me as a obituary, I felt, I felt sad. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9856.720000000001s)]
*  This is my last line from him and I think you'll like it. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9861.960000000001s)]
*  These are some of the people you deal with. He said, now Scott, [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9865.0s)]
*  I'm going to speed it up because he was on pills a lot and he drank all day and [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9867.560000000001s)]

*  I was pretty sure it's the dope keeping him alive. I think he died. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9877.400000000001s)]
*  He just doesn't know it yet, but he would be like, now Scott, you know, [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9880.92s)]
*  I don't do cocaine anymore. And I'd go, I know, man. He goes, [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHIDX1lC3k&t=9885.68s)]
