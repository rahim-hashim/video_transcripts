# Joe Rogan Experience #1883 - Ryan Graves
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0)
*  Nice to meet you, Brian. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=0.0s)]
*  Nice to meet you, Joe. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=13.92s)]
*  Pleasure to be here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=14.92s)]
*  You're one of four or five people that I've talked to that have seen something that might [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=15.92s)]
*  be from somewhere else. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=21.04s)]
*  It's always weird when you talk to someone that may have seen something that... [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=22.6s)]
*  Let's just first, before we even get started, please tell people your credentials, what [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=28.96s)]
*  your background is. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=33.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=34.76s)]
*  So, you know, my name is Ryan Graves. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=35.76s)]
*  I have an engineering degree, mechanical and aerospace engineering. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=38.32s)]
*  I promptly left doing that to go fly F-18s for the Navy as soon as I graduated college. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Did that for about a decade, both operationally in combat as well as an instructor role teaching [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  the new students. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  We did witness something while we were flying in our jets, but we witnessed it in the context [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  of our just everyday flying in our missions. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=63.96s)]
*  And what year was it that you witnessed this? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=67.48s)]
*  So we started seeing these in 2014 was the earliest that I know, late 2013, early 2014. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=70.16s)]
*  And could you describe what was the very first experience? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=77.46s)]
*  Yeah, so for me personally, the experience was simply just flying out to the area like [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=80.28s)]
*  I would any other day. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=85.72s)]
*  And instead of seeing an empty airspace with just my wing person or another squadron doing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  something a different block, there were all of a sudden a lot of different radar contacts, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=92.6s)]
*  which is immediately a problem because, you know, we could be hitting one of those or [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  someone working in our area. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=100.61999999999999s)]
*  And this was happening because we upgraded our radar the best we could tell. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=103.8s)]
*  We were in a earlier radar called the APG-73 and we had come back from deployment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=106.96s)]
*  We entered a maintenance phase, it's called. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  We kind of do a little bit less flying, upgrade the jets if we need to, do any long lasting [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=115.62s)]
*  maintenance. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=119.5s)]
*  And we upgraded to the APG-79, which was a much better radar. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=122.53999999999999s)]
*  And what is the difference in the capabilities of the upgraded radar system versus the original [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=126.38s)]
*  system? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=131.46s)]
*  So, you know, kind of frankly speaking, it's like going from an analog TV essentially to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=132.46s)]
*  like an OLED. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=137.04s)]
*  It's, you know, a digital modern tool compared to more of like an analog classical radar [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=138.04s)]
*  that has more limited range and has less ability to track multiple targets and things [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=144.18s)]
*  of that nature. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  So just generally speaking, we would expect to see, you know, more objects if there were [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  any out there or smaller objects, but there shouldn't have been any objects out there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=155.18s)]
*  And so how far offshore are you when this is all going down? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=161.34s)]
*  Our working area starts about 10 miles off the coast and then it goes out, you know, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=165.44s)]
*  or 250 miles or so that we don't usually use those far eastern areas. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=169.94s)]
*  But we would only see them over the water. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=175.06s)]
*  So they would really only be in our working areas, maybe slightly, you know, in between [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=176.74s)]
*  the working areas of land, but never over the land, sometimes over the bays that are [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=182.3s)]
*  in the area that are quite large, but never just kind of zooming west over land or anything [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=186.62s)]
*  like that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=191.98s)]
*  And is this restricted airspace? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=192.98s)]
*  It's not. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=194.98s)]
*  So that's a tricky question. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=195.98s)]
*  For us operating in a military operating area, it is not restricted in the sense that you [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=197.01999999999998s)]
*  have to be there's only one person allowed in there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  You could have these little Cessnas kind of bumbling in there, but they would get called [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=206.22s)]
*  out pretty quick, both from the kind of air traffic control agency that's working out [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=209.98s)]
*  there as well as F-18s and the other aircraft that may be working out there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=215.17999999999998s)]
*  In a broader sense, when we look at it in relation to our air defense identification [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=221.98s)]
*  zone, which is essentially a band of airspace that surrounds our entire country, if you [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=226.98s)]
*  are if your flight path originates over the water outside of the ATIS and you proceed [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=232.1s)]
*  into the ATIS into our controlled airspace, then you do have to essentially have permission [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=237.86s)]
*  to enter that airspace. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=242.82s)]
*  It's not a restricted airspace like a traditional bombing range, but it is protected airspace. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=244.3s)]
*  It's our coastal air. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=249.58s)]
*  So you have this upgraded radar system and what are you detecting? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=251.46s)]
*  So on the radar, really what we can learn from that is essentially the kinematics of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  the object. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=261.66s)]
*  So where is it essentially and what directions are going, how fast is it going, things of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=262.66s)]
*  that nature. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=268.02s)]
*  We can't necessarily make up the shape or things of that nature. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=269.02s)]
*  So it's a representation. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=272.06s)]
*  It's like a block on our screen to show that information. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  And so when we see that on our radar, we can tell where it's located, perhaps what's located [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  around it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=283.9s)]
*  There's other objects we're detecting, how fast it's going, what direction it's pointed [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=284.9s)]
*  in, what direction it's traveling in. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=288.41999999999996s)]
*  So we call that velocity vector. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=293.34s)]
*  So if we see this essentially little circle, I have a tail coming off of it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=294.78s)]
*  And that tail kind of represents the nose of the vehicle, at least as its flight path [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=298.94s)]
*  is going. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=303.17999999999995s)]
*  And so with that, we would typically see an aircraft just kind of trudge along with [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=304.26s)]
*  a straight line, taking occasional turns. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=307.94s)]
*  But these objects had a little bit more of a, I don't want to say random, but more less [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=312.26s)]
*  controlled flight path. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=318.9s)]
*  That velocity vector would kind of jump around a bit more. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=321.24s)]
*  They would not proceed in a perfectly straight line, as you would imagine a flight navigation [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=324.62s)]
*  computer would take you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=329.88s)]
*  It takes you from A to B in the straightest line possible. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=331.94s)]
*  These objects seem to kind of be moving in a direction that was not a straight line, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  but generally proceeding in that direction. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=339.62s)]
*  And so they would kind of be meandering slightly, but moving in that general direction, both [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=341.70000000000005s)]
*  three dimensionally and horizontally. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=346.18s)]
*  So winding around, going up, going down. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=347.98s)]
*  So they're not on a flat plane, and they're not going in a straight line. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=351.22s)]
*  So I don't want to draw too many firm statements like that, because we would see them being [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=355.26000000000005s)]
*  flat too. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  They're perfectly stationary up there, regardless of the wind. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=360.28s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=364.2s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=365.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=366.2s)]
*  So what kind of wind are you talking about? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=367.2s)]
*  Oh gosh, I mean at altitude you can have anywhere up to 120 knots of airspeed. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=369.55999999999995s)]
*  Which is, what is that in miles per hour? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  It's about 130, 140 miles per hour. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=376.44s)]
*  So they're completely stationary with 140 mile an hour wind. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  Correct. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  How would something do that? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  It's confusing to me as well. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=385.08s)]
*  Even if we had something that could just burn that much energy, like if you had a sphere [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=386.84s)]
*  surrounded by little rockets, just imagining something right now. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=392.21999999999997s)]
*  And if you wanted to keep that perfectly stationary against gravity, you could just fire all the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=395.56s)]
*  rockets at the bottom really fast and hopefully keep it flat. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=402.44s)]
*  It's going to have tiny little variations. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=404.88s)]
*  And then if you have wind hitting it and all this, you could potentially have those rockets [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  try to counter it, but it would never be perfectly still in winds like that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  Because the wind's not perfectly still either, right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=416.76s)]
*  It changes and varies. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=417.76s)]
*  It does. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=418.76s)]
*  So it's almost like it's the wind. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=419.76s)]
*  It's not even really fighting the wind it seems. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=420.76s)]
*  It just seems like it's just there in a way. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=421.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=425.76s)]
*  So the first time you see these things, what are your thoughts? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=426.76s)]
*  Yeah, the first time really was, well, what is this? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=431.84s)]
*  It's not a UFO or something mysterious at this point. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=436.0s)]
*  At what we're thinking at this point, we see on the radar, it's just, well, our radar is [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=439.88s)]
*  broken. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=444.36s)]
*  We perhaps don't represent physical objects yet because we hadn't visually seen these [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=445.36s)]
*  or seen them on our camera yet. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=449.44s)]
*  And so we're like, hey, what's going on here? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=451.48s)]
*  Is anyone else seeing this kind of thing? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  But not really investigating it, right? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=457.88s)]
*  It's just like, all right, there's stuff out there, but maybe next time we'll take a look. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=460.0s)]
*  But the way our systems work, when we have all these contacts on our radar, and if we [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=465.24s)]
*  just select one out with our little cursor there, all our sensors go to it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=470.2s)]
*  Our FLIR goes to it, which is our camera system, all our weapons. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=474.04s)]
*  They have their own little eyes in some sense, and they all look in that direction. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=478.68s)]
*  And so eventually, someone had one of these selected and flew close enough so that as [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=482.32s)]
*  they look at their FLIR system, their camera, they could see something that was at the spot [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=488.52000000000004s)]
*  represented on the radar, right? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=493.88s)]
*  So there was something there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=495.48s)]
*  So they were seeing it visually with their own eyes? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=496.48s)]
*  Not at this point, just on the FLIR system. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  The FLIR system. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=500.6s)]
*  It's a regular camera and also an infrared camera. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=502.56s)]
*  And so typically, we'll roll around in infrared just because it returns a better image, typically. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=505.20000000000005s)]
*  So yeah, it didn't look like an object they were seeing on the FLIR. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=511.0s)]
*  Just looked like a source of IR energy in a sense, almost as if someone was shining [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=515.4s)]
*  a flashlight. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=518.88s)]
*  But something had to be there to be reflecting that energy or creating it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=520.36s)]
*  So at this point, to answer your question, now we're like, OK, this isn't just an error [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=524.6800000000001s)]
*  on our radar. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=528.32s)]
*  This is perhaps, you know, we're thinking this is real. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=529.36s)]
*  We have to really respect this as like a safety hazard now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=531.56s)]
*  Even if it's just a small, you know, however small ribbon of tin foil, right? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=535.1999999999999s)]
*  Like that sucked down the engine can still take out an aircraft, right? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=541.52s)]
*  So we have to be very respectful of that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  Like a Mylar balloon type thing? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  Potentially, right? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=547.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  But how fast are these things going? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  So sometimes stationary, right? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=552.3599999999999s)]
*  Sometimes they would be going around 0.6 to 0.8 Mach, which is at altitude about 240 [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=555.48s)]
*  to maybe 330 knots, you know, around there. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=562.52s)]
*  So somewhere in the range of an airplane. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=565.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=567.8s)]
*  And a fighter aircraft would be kind of flying around at those airspeeds, except sometimes [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=568.8s)]
*  they would be perfectly stationary as well. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=573.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=575.64s)]
*  So it's not exhibiting any sort of patterns that you've recognized in the past? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=576.64s)]
*  No, they have actually. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=581.64s)]
*  But with the stationary, no, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=584.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=586.0s)]
*  With the stationary, no. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=587.0s)]
*  With the meandering kind of flight path, no. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=588.2800000000001s)]
*  But I would also see them essentially fly what we call a racetrack pattern. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=590.36s)]
*  And essentially what that means is they fly in a straight path and then they do like a [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=594.72s)]
*  180 degree turn in a certain direction. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=598.48s)]
*  Then they fly a straight path, then turn again. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  So that's what we call a racetrack pattern as opposed to a circular holding pattern. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  We did witness racetrack patterns. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=609.7600000000001s)]
*  In fact, I think there's been some cases off the West Coast just the past couple of weeks [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=612.24s)]
*  where people have also been observing objects flying in racetrack patterns high at altitude [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=615.76s)]
*  with lights. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=620.64s)]
*  So I do recognize that behavior, but I don't necessarily think that means we have to attribute [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=622.28s)]
*  it to normal behavior necessarily. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=627.88s)]
*  That type of flight path is important because it's a very efficient way to fly. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=631.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=635.72s)]
*  If you have to maintain the position in a certain area, you want to minimize how much [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=636.72s)]
*  you're turning. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=640.56s)]
*  Because any time you're turning in an aircraft, you're using more energy than if you were [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=641.56s)]
*  just flying straight and level. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=644.7199999999999s)]
*  And so by having a racetrack pattern, it's an efficient way of holding in a position [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=646.64s)]
*  by maximizing straight level time and minimizing your turn time. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=650.7199999999999s)]
*  And how long would these things stay up there for? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=655.0s)]
*  So from my experience, from our experience, and again, we weren't studying these, but [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=658.8s)]
*  they were always out there. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=663.0s)]
*  You know, they were out there when we took off, we'd see them and then we'd go to land, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=664.16s)]
*  they would still be out there. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=667.7199999999999s)]
*  Like every day? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=668.76s)]
*  Every day. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=670.12s)]
*  Every day. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=671.12s)]
*  Every day. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=672.12s)]
*  So you guys go from not having any idea that these things are out there to an upgraded [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=673.12s)]
*  radar system to seeing them every day. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=678.2s)]
*  What is the thought? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=681.8s)]
*  Like how are you feeling when these, like is there an evolution of the thought pattern [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=682.8s)]
*  of how you're addressing these things and thinking about them? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=689.08s)]
*  Initially you're thinking they're errors. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=693.04s)]
*  When do you start getting a thought that like, what the fuck is this thing? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=695.0s)]
*  So that happened when we visually saw one. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=700.68s)]
*  And the first time we visually saw one, the object was directly at what we call the entry [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  point of the area. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=709.56s)]
*  So you know, that box that I told you about in the sky that starts 10 miles off the coast, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=710.76s)]
*  there's a particular GPS, you know, location and altitude where incoming traffic will fly [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=714.88s)]
*  in and outbound traffic will fly into the exact same spot, but will fly out a thousand [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=720.52s)]
*  feet lower. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=725.4799999999999s)]
*  There were two aircraft from my squadron, VFA 11, and we flew, or excuse me, they flew, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=727.68s)]
*  took off as a flight of two. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=733.4799999999999s)]
*  That means they're essentially flying in a formation like this. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=735.7199999999999s)]
*  And as they hit the area, one of these objects went right between the aircraft. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=739.2399999999999s)]
*  The lead aircrew saw the object. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=743.2399999999999s)]
*  The Dash 2 aircraft crew did not, which is not surprising because they're usually, you [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=746.3599999999999s)]
*  know, you're very focused on flying formation. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=751.3599999999999s)]
*  You're just staring right at that aircraft. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=753.9599999999999s)]
*  The lead really has actual leeway to look around. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=755.88s)]
*  So he saw it and, you know, he immediately came back. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=758.08s)]
*  I have to assume he didn't have it on his radar because he wouldn't have flown through [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=762.4399999999999s)]
*  this object at the working, at the entrance point. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=765.64s)]
*  He flew, he turned around, flew back, landed, and I was in the ready room when he had come [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=769.64s)]
*  back and, you know, he had all his gear on, which typically is not a good thing because [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=773.12s)]
*  you want to get that stuff off as fast as possible. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=778.48s)]
*  So usually means, you know, there's a problem of some nature. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=780.68s)]
*  And, you know, he was just sitting there saying, hey, you know, I was hit with those damn things. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=784.84s)]
*  And we all knew what he was referring to, even though we didn't actually have a name [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=788.88s)]
*  for it just because we were seeing these so much. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=791.5600000000001s)]
*  And he described it, you know, he described it just as a black or dark gray cube. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=793.96s)]
*  And that cube was inside of a clear translucent sphere. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=799.52s)]
*  And essentially the apex or the corners of that cube, best he could tell, were touching [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=803.96s)]
*  the inside of that sphere. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=809.0s)]
*  That description mirrors many of the descriptions that people have had of these, whatever you [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=811.56s)]
*  want to call them, they're calling them UAPs now for some strange reason. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=818.24s)]
*  UFOs, I don't know, does it have a dirty connotation to it? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=821.92s)]
*  Is it tainted because of so many crazy people talk about UFOs? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=825.96s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=829.56s)]
*  It does come with a lot of assumptions baked in. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=830.56s)]
*  Yeah, it baked in, that's yeah. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=832.12s)]
*  So that's something, but whatever it is, that is a design that people have reported seeing [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=834.48s)]
*  before, that this translucent sphere and this cube, can you see through the cube? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=841.2s)]
*  Not to my understanding, no. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=848.84s)]
*  So it's some sort of solid black cube that's inside this translucent sphere. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=850.12s)]
*  And it's just floating around and flying around the sky. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=855.96s)]
*  So you know, that's a good point. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=860.6s)]
*  Is it floating around? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  Is it flying around? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=863.64s)]
*  It's doing both, which is strange, right? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=864.64s)]
*  Because you could think of that description and be like, okay, that's kind of some kind [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=866.4s)]
*  of weird balloon maybe with stuff in it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=869.16s)]
*  And that's certainly one way, if you just view that angle of it, then it seems explainable. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=871.8s)]
*  But when that balloon-like object starts cruising down at 0.8 Mach, that nullifies that particular [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=877.04s)]
*  idea. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=884.1999999999999s)]
*  And you'll see that a lot where it's not just like that one picture, that one behavior. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=886.5799999999999s)]
*  You kind of have to zoom out a bit and look at everything in relation to each other and [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=891.04s)]
*  say, okay, why is this weird? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=894.68s)]
*  It was hanging out in a racetrack pattern. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=897.24s)]
*  That's not exotic. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=898.8s)]
*  But when you learn it was doing it for perhaps 13 hours. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=899.8s)]
*  13 hours? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=903.9599999999999s)]
*  Perhaps they were out there all the time. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=905.56s)]
*  So I land and I go back. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=907.0799999999999s)]
*  And we weren't on a Intel mission to analyze these. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=910.04s)]
*  We're going to do our training. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=913.92s)]
*  It's very expensive, 30k an hour to fly these things. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=914.92s)]
*  So really the only time we can put energy into looking at these things when we're kind [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=918.04s)]
*  of transiting back and forth or waiting for a fight to start. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=922.0799999999999s)]
*  And so it's never like a dedicated analysis. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  One of the problems I've had is that people haven't wanted to look into and to study this [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=929.1999999999999s)]
*  topic. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=935.12s)]
*  And people ask me all the time, okay, what are you seeing on the jet? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  What are you seeing in the radar? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=939.76s)]
*  I want to be able to tell them that there was a great thing that we saw, but the NF-18 [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=941.8s)]
*  is not a scientific tool. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=945.8s)]
*  We only get presented a certain amount of information when all the sensors essentially [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=948.84s)]
*  filter all the data out so that we can prosecute the targets and do our job. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=952.6s)]
*  It's not some type of analog information we receive. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=958.24s)]
*  So just because, say, something is showing jamming on my radar from one of these objects, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=962.04s)]
*  doesn't mean the object is executing electronic warfare to jam my jet. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=967.28s)]
*  It just means that it's doing something to our radar signal. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=972.1s)]
*  When it comes back, our jet is processing it like it's EW. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=975.08s)]
*  So we need to get proper scientific tools to do an analysis on these objects instead [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=979.4200000000001s)]
*  of basing a lot of our analysis right now just on tools of war that aren't built for [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=983.9s)]
*  that. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=988.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=989.38s)]
*  How long can you guys stay up in an NF-18? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=990.38s)]
*  If we're dogfighting, about an hour. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=993.38s)]
*  If we're holding at 0.6 to 0.8 Mach, like I described them as doing, somewhere maybe [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=995.94s)]
*  around two, two and a half hours maximum. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1001.14s)]
*  And you think that these things are up there for far longer than that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1005.74s)]
*  So how big was this thing when this guy saw it? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1008.78s)]
*  So it's very difficult to tell in the air, but because they were flying in formation, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1012.62s)]
*  we can make some estimated guesses essentially, and that's what we did when we talked about [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1016.98s)]
*  it afterwards. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1020.7s)]
*  So the aircraft were about 100 feet apart. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1021.7s)]
*  They estimate it essentially split the section, which means it went more or less right down [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1025.06s)]
*  the middle, but slightly closer to lead, which would put it somewhere at less than 50 feet, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1028.78s)]
*  on average, if they're about 100 feet. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1034.98s)]
*  So he essentially used that size reference to say, hey, this might have been somewhere [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1038.78s)]
*  in the five to 15 foot diameter. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1043.3400000000001s)]
*  It's not a tight guess, but that's the best we could come up with. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1047.26s)]
*  And what is it like? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1051.3000000000002s)]
*  What's the atmosphere like when you go back to the base? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1054.38s)]
*  Are you allowed to discuss this? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1058.5800000000002s)]
*  Is this something that's openly talked about? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1060.5s)]
*  Is this something that you get ridiculed for? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1062.82s)]
*  It's just, you know, like you would expect any group of dude and dudettes hearing about [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1064.9399999999998s)]
*  this to just kind of do the normal reaction like anyone else and to kind of make the jokes [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1072.34s)]
*  and then kind of get back to work essentially because we're just so busy at this time, right? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1078.58s)]
*  We're getting ready for war. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1084.1s)]
*  For a lot of us, this is the apex of our career to get ready for deployment. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1086.2199999999998s)]
*  It's kind of like the long blade gets cut in a sense in a fighter community like that. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1092.9s)]
*  It's very much a trust-based organization. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1095.9s)]
*  So no one's out there looking to make a big deal out of something that's completely irrelevant [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1099.34s)]
*  in our eyes to our day-to-day operations other than a safety risk. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1104.7s)]
*  That's really as much as we could process it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1108.9s)]
*  So yeah, there was ridicule, but I don't think it was, I wouldn't say it was over the top [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1110.62s)]
*  or emotionally damaging, but it made it clear it wasn't something to like, we were going [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1115.7s)]
*  to like put serious thought and energy into. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1119.5800000000002s)]
*  It was, hey, yeah, stay away and let me know how you're doing that next fight, essentially. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1121.5800000000002s)]
*  And when you discuss this, how many other people came forward with similar stories? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1126.38s)]
*  It was less about people coming forward because everyone was just like, well, yeah, of course, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1132.54s)]
*  we see them out there. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1135.5s)]
*  Like at this point when it was almost a safety issue at this point, well, let me back up. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1136.5s)]
*  At first, as soon as people, the jokes subsided when people eventually flew in a jet with [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1141.5800000000002s)]
*  upgraded radar and saw it themselves. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1146.9s)]
*  So it dwindled down where everyone was aware of this and it was just a safety hazard. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1149.06s)]
*  But when we almost had the midair, that kind of upped the ante, right? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1154.6200000000001s)]
*  Because we were kind of getting pissed at this point because the high probability answer [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1157.1s)]
*  was that this was some type of classified program of our own making that had perhaps [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1162.06s)]
*  just started operating in an area they weren't supposed to for whatever reason. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1167.28s)]
*  That was kind of our assumption. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1173.5s)]
*  We submitted a safety report because of that near midair hazard report, which is essentially [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1175.5600000000002s)]
*  a notice that goes out to the whole fleet that says this is a potential hazard that [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1182.72s)]
*  could cause the loss of an aircraft. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1187.6000000000001s)]
*  And it was due to us almost hitting an unknown object of unknown origin. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1190.6000000000001s)]
*  And that's how it continued for a while. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1196.02s)]
*  And there was a number of has reps about that, about near misses. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1197.52s)]
*  Eventually they put out what's called a NOTAM or Notice to Airmen, which is published on [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1201.8s)]
*  a federal website which essentially lists things like, hey, the runway lights are down [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1208.0s)]
*  or they're working on this runway or this area is closed for something. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1212.8s)]
*  And we had one in our local area that said, you know, caution for the unknown objects [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1218.24s)]
*  working in our operating areas. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1222.1599999999999s)]
*  We just don't know what they are essentially. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1225.6s)]
*  So that's just kind of where it stagnated at that point as far as resolution. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1227.4s)]
*  That's got to be a very bizarre feeling. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1232.92s)]
*  You're flying around in these jets preparing for deployment and you see things that are, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1235.8400000000001s)]
*  if not unexplainable, haven't been explained yet. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1244.48s)]
*  It just didn't fit into our framework, right? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1250.88s)]
*  Even if we look at it, so when we were really trying to hash it out in the squadron, it's [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1253.24s)]
*  okay, what could these be? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1257.92s)]
*  And even the classified drone thing, and I'm not even going to consider all the things [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1259.52s)]
*  that have happened since then, but even at this time, the drone thing didn't make sense [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1264.64s)]
*  to us for a number of reasons. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1268.52s)]
*  One of those is why? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1270.32s)]
*  Why do we have potentially hundreds or more small drones that can perform better than [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1273.76s)]
*  anything we've seen just hanging out for years off the coast? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1280.12s)]
*  And is there a visible method of propulsion that's coming from these objects? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1283.8s)]
*  No. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1287.52s)]
*  What about a heat signature? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1288.52s)]
*  No. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1290.08s)]
*  So there's no plume of heat coming out the back. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1291.08s)]
*  There's no propellers. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1295.1599999999999s)]
*  There's no wing surfaces that we've seen. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1296.2399999999998s)]
*  And when you're looking at it, are you looking at it through some sort of an infrared that [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1298.36s)]
*  will detect heat? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1301.9399999999998s)]
*  You don't see anything? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1303.8799999999999s)]
*  Usually through infrared, yeah. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  So it'll come back as either a white hut or a dark hut, which means black color represents [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1305.96s)]
*  heat. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1312.96s)]
*  Hut? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1313.96s)]
*  What is hut? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1314.96s)]
*  Essentially, if we're looking at an object against a blue sky, if that thing's producing [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1315.96s)]
*  heat, then it's going to come out white in white hut. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1320.64s)]
*  So if I see a white object, it's going to be a hot object, and the sky is going to look [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1324.1200000000001s)]
*  blue. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1328.1200000000001s)]
*  What's that word hut you're using? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  H-O-T. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1330.1200000000001s)]
*  H-O-T? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1331.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, hot. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1332.1200000000001s)]
*  Like the temperature. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1333.1200000000001s)]
*  Hot. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1334.1200000000001s)]
*  No, it's okay. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1335.36s)]
*  I'm from New England, too. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1336.36s)]
*  I just thought it was something else. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1337.36s)]
*  I thought it was like a technical term. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1338.36s)]
*  And I say that just to say that it would just be like either all like completely one temperature, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1341.36s)]
*  essentially. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1348.1599999999999s)]
*  It wasn't like the skin of an aircraft you could see. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1349.1599999999999s)]
*  It was just kind of like an emission of IR energy, like a flashlight. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1350.6799999999998s)]
*  Sometimes most of the time it would be cold. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1354.2399999999998s)]
*  It was like a cold object. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1356.76s)]
*  So it didn't appear to actually be emitting heat. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1358.3999999999999s)]
*  There were times when they did appear to be emitting as a hot object as well. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1361.2s)]
*  So we did see both. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1365.8000000000002s)]
*  So I don't know what to make of that. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1366.8000000000002s)]
*  Was there a difference in the way they were moving when it was exhibiting heat? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1368.48s)]
*  Not that I know. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1374.88s)]
*  I don't want to say no, but we just didn't look at it deep enough to say that at the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1377.2s)]
*  time. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1381.8000000000002s)]
*  But whatever it was doing, it wasn't exhibiting any of the characteristics that you would [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1382.8000000000002s)]
*  normally expect from a jet or a drone or something that had some sort of a visible [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1386.8s)]
*  method of propulsion. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1392.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1394.1599999999999s)]
*  So when these things are happening every day and all these different pilots are experiencing [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1396.08s)]
*  them every day, this is essentially just from the moment of 2014-ish when this new radar [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1403.8999999999999s)]
*  system gets implemented. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1411.12s)]
*  So you had one sense of what was out there and then all of a sudden you have these new [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1412.74s)]
*  systems and now you're like, whoa, this is littered with these things. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1417.66s)]
*  What is that like? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1424.1s)]
*  For you personally, what does that feel like? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1425.82s)]
*  It's just comforting. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1428.5s)]
*  We spend a lot of time and energy on the most basic aspects of flight in a sense. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1429.5s)]
*  Because if you can't just operate safely, you can't come back and land and manage your [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1434.48s)]
*  not bust through altitudes and all that. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1439.7s)]
*  You can't do all the other stuff. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1441.9s)]
*  So we're very particular on those type of details. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1443.5800000000002s)]
*  So to have someone operating in that area would be a massive oversight. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1446.96s)]
*  So it was, in a sense, we kind of, at least I did, felt a bit let down. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1451.5s)]
*  It was like someone should be willing to look at this and deal with this problem. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1455.46s)]
*  If it was going to constantly, it was not that it was constantly getting laughed at. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1461.42s)]
*  We've always had more bigger fish to fry, essentially. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1465.3s)]
*  Which I respect and I understand, but it doesn't mean we completely ignore that. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1468.62s)]
*  We have to do more than just, we have responsibility, I think, as aviators, when we're up there [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1474.22s)]
*  to report really what we're seeing. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1479.46s)]
*  Because we're on the front line of what we can see up there. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1480.82s)]
*  If we don't have the command or operational support to tell the truth about what we're [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1483.26s)]
*  seeing up there, then things have to change. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1491.1s)]
*  The ramifications of what these things possibly could be, how much does that weigh on you? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1495.06s)]
*  Because if these things are from another world or from the ocean or from another dimension [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1500.1399999999999s)]
*  or fill in the blank, whatever you think it could be, that alone has got to be very weird [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1506.34s)]
*  to experience because this is not something that's being openly discussed. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1513.06s)]
*  So you're just flying around out there, you get this new equipment, and then all of a [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1516.58s)]
*  sudden you're like, hey, there's some stuff out here that we have no knowledge of. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1520.34s)]
*  And it's moving in a way that we really can't explain. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1527.1399999999999s)]
*  What is that like? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1530.26s)]
*  We never really appreciated it at the time. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1532.54s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1534.58s)]
*  Because you're so mission focused. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1535.58s)]
*  We were so mission focused. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1536.58s)]
*  And the point when we kind of left our squadron, we left for deployment in 2015. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1537.58s)]
*  And so this was still happening. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1543.82s)]
*  It was prior to the point that they started putting that notice out to Airmen, that NOTAM [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1546.9s)]
*  out. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1551.46s)]
*  So they still not even got to the point to have that general notice out. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1552.46s)]
*  It was just people sending out the occasional hazard reports and left from an individual [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1555.74s)]
*  squadron and then we left for deployment. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1559.7800000000002s)]
*  Well, excuse me, we left for workups first, I should say. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1562.18s)]
*  So let me backtrack a little bit. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1567.7s)]
*  As we get ready for deployment, we have our date where we leave, but then about six months [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1570.5s)]
*  prior to that, we're gone to the aircraft carrier and the different training areas to [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1574.82s)]
*  essentially get ready for that deployment and practice like we play. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1580.3799999999999s)]
*  So we start going on the boat, we live on the boat, we start doing tactics off the boat. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1583.54s)]
*  And we left to go down to the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, on an event where we essentially [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1588.82s)]
*  do exactly that. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1596.12s)]
*  We fly out on the aircraft carrier and we do a number of tactical missions to simulate [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1597.1799999999998s)]
*  that we are in operational theater. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1602.3s)]
*  And honestly, it's more dangerous and likely difficult in a lot of cases than the actual [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1606.54s)]
*  combat deployment. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1610.54s)]
*  We're preparing for every eventuality, air-to-air combat, rescue missions, everything. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1612.62s)]
*  But of course, not everything gets exercised when you get out there. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1617.82s)]
*  So it's much more dangerous and pretty intense. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1621.8999999999999s)]
*  And so that's what we were getting ready to go do. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1625.5s)]
*  And then we left and we did that. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1627.04s)]
*  When we got down in that area from Virginia Beach, we noticed that these objects were [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1629.66s)]
*  down there as well. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1634.38s)]
*  We didn't know whether they came with us or whether they were already down there. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1636.64s)]
*  But once we started flying off the boat about 1,500 miles or so south of Virginia Beach, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1640.02s)]
*  there they were again. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1646.7s)]
*  And it was in my squadron again when the video that's known as the Gimbo video now, when [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1648.9s)]
*  that was recorded, we were on that workup cycle out in Jacksonville. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1656.14s)]
*  We should play the Gimbo video. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1659.8999999999999s)]
*  Jamie, will you please pull that up? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1661.3799999999999s)]
*  Because I want you to kind of give us an understanding from your own expertise, like your technical [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1664.82s)]
*  understanding of what we're looking at. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1671.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so this is the FLIR. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1673.4599999999998s)]
*  So this is FLIR footage? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1676.78s)]
*  Yep. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1679.1s)]
*  So this is when I say FLIR, this is what I'm referring to. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1680.1s)]
*  And right in the middle, at the top of the screen, you see IR, infrared. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1682.4599999999998s)]
*  So that's that infrared mode where we're seeing heat right now. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1686.54s)]
*  We're in black hot. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1691.3s)]
*  So that means objects that are darker are hotter. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1693.58s)]
*  So this object right in the middle is putting heat out. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1697.5s)]
*  And right now it appears to be rotating. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1701.98s)]
*  Is that what it was doing there? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1705.42s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1707.26s)]
*  So we do see this object rotate. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1708.68s)]
*  I mean, it looks like a gimbal. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1711.06s)]
*  That's why it's called that thing. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1712.3s)]
*  I didn't name it. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1713.3s)]
*  But we do. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1714.84s)]
*  So the object essentially rotate from what looks like a horizontal position here. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1715.84s)]
*  Those lines above it represent the horizon. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1720.0s)]
*  So it's essentially parallel. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1721.8999999999999s)]
*  There it goes. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1724.36s)]
*  And it's hard to make out the shape of this thing, but it seems almost like a disk with [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1725.36s)]
*  like a crown on the top and the bottom. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1731.04s)]
*  Yeah, kind of like it looks like almost like a little bit of energy coming out from the [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1734.32s)]
*  poles there, if you will. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1739.08s)]
*  That's kind of how I describe it. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1740.54s)]
*  I see like a little bit of the dark, you know, emanating from there or the energy, as I call [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1741.68s)]
*  it. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1746.52s)]
*  And is there any way from this video, from this equipment to detect how large this thing [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1747.52s)]
*  is? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1753.3200000000002s)]
*  There is. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1754.3200000000002s)]
*  So the velocity vector in the middle there can be set to a particular size. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1755.5600000000002s)]
*  And that size correlates to a particular length. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1762.72s)]
*  So that in a dogfight, if you have, you know, you're behind the guy and you essentially [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1765.46s)]
*  his wingspan is equal to the length of those two lines on that circle with the lines coming [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1771.8s)]
*  out. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1776.92s)]
*  See that's velocity vector, then you know how far away he is. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1777.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1780.32s)]
*  So it's kind of like an analog thing that's not super relevant, like in modern days. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1781.32s)]
*  But yes, there is. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1784.48s)]
*  I don't know, however, what that is set to in this one. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1785.48s)]
*  So I can't like make that calculation for you right now. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1788.44s)]
*  Now I know some people who have attempted to debunk this and debunk even the rotation [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1791.32s)]
*  of this object. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1796.54s)]
*  How do you know that that object is rotating? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1798.7s)]
*  Definitively? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1802.22s)]
*  Well, so we don't, right? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1804.6599999999999s)]
*  We don't necessarily definitively know it's rotating at the end of the day, right? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1809.32s)]
*  We have evidence that it is, but I don't have definitive evidence that you're a conscious [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1812.7s)]
*  human being on those other table with me either. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1817.4399999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1820.3200000000002s)]
*  We just don't have that information. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1821.3200000000002s)]
*  So you only have video footage and in the video footage it appears right now in relation [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1822.3200000000002s)]
*  to where it sits on the clouds that it has rotated. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1826.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1829.2s)]
*  So we can also see if you, and I know it's been done, people have created models out [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1830.2s)]
*  there that essentially look at the clouds and they draw out a flight path that this [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1836.8200000000002s)]
*  could be at. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1843.72s)]
*  And the only variable is essentially how far away the object is. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1844.72s)]
*  And that flight path obeys an equation that can be observed pretty readily when you build [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1848.64s)]
*  the little model. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1854.74s)]
*  And essentially if you're at six miles or so, the object is proceeding in direction [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1856.3400000000001s)]
*  and then when it starts to rotate, as the aircraft described, it climbs and reverses [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1862.1000000000001s)]
*  directions. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1867.26s)]
*  So you can't quite make that out, but when you actually model it out, you can see that [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1868.26s)]
*  at these ranges it does what was claimed. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1873.3000000000002s)]
*  We're kind of skipping a little bit of storage, so maybe I should back up. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1877.16s)]
*  So when this object was observed, the aircrew essentially saw it on what they call a situational [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1879.44s)]
*  awareness page. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1887.52s)]
*  And so that is a gods-eye view of all the sensor data and everything else that our jets [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1888.9s)]
*  and other jets put out. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1895.2s)]
*  And so we can put cursors on and move around, select stuff. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1897.48s)]
*  What the aircrew described during this video verbally is a formation of objects and then [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1902.38s)]
*  the gimbal object. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1907.74s)]
*  So what happened was we had all gone out on an air-to-air training mission during this [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1909.3400000000001s)]
*  workup cycle off of the aircraft carrier, the Theodore Roosevelt. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1914.74s)]
*  And again, we're off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1917.94s)]
*  And there's like four or five or six red fighters, which are our own guys or your gals acting [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1922.18s)]
*  as the enemy, and then we go up and act as the blue fighters and go do our tactics. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1928.42s)]
*  I was part of the flight. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1935.3600000000001s)]
*  We all flew up there. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1936.3600000000001s)]
*  When we kind of run out of gas during the fight, you kind of just return by yourself. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1937.5600000000002s)]
*  And if you still have gas, you continue the fight type of thing. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1941.64s)]
*  So we don't always fly home together. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1944.72s)]
*  In this case, the aircrew from the gimbal video, they knocked it off and started flying [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1946.96s)]
*  back to the boat. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1952.16s)]
*  We don't go directly back to the boat when we run out of gas. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1954.44s)]
*  It seems counterintuitive, but we have to wait for our landing time. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1957.46s)]
*  We can't just come back and land earlier. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1961.8200000000002s)]
*  So it doesn't really matter where we are as long as we're nearby. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1963.78s)]
*  And we just slow down to what we call our max endurance speed. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1967.1000000000001s)]
*  So we just kind of cruise around, puddle along out there, and just hang out until it's our [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1970.1000000000001s)]
*  time to land. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1973.8200000000002s)]
*  And so while they were doing this, they noticed that there was a group of contacts on their [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1976.9s)]
*  situational awareness page, again, from their radar. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1981.06s)]
*  And they're like, hey, maybe this is like a penetration test, because they'll launch [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1985.24s)]
*  aircraft from the coast, like old fighters or just things that can move relatively quick, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1988.1999999999998s)]
*  but not necessarily there to engage us in a dogfight. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1995.48s)]
*  Let's see if we can detect them and intercept them in time and things of that nature, part [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=1997.6799999999998s)]
*  of the overall training. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2001.36s)]
*  And so when they saw these objects, that's what they thought this was. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2003.4399999999998s)]
*  And so they started flying over to it. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2006.76s)]
*  And they got about six to seven, eight miles away. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2011.36s)]
*  Six to eight is what the air crew told me. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2014.8s)]
*  They didn't want to get any closer because it was nighttime at this point. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2017.9199999999998s)]
*  They couldn't see the object, which is why they were only in the IR mode. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2020.9199999999998s)]
*  And they essentially, they checked out for a bit and then circled a bit and then flew [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2026.12s)]
*  back essentially as it was time for their recovery. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2030.3s)]
*  But what they saw was, you saw the gimbal object that we saw in the film, but there [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2033.36s)]
*  was also a formation of like four to five, I might say six, I don't remember the exact [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2038.02s)]
*  number, but somewhere in the four to six range, objects that were flying in a wedge formation. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2042.42s)]
*  So essentially like a triangle without a base. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2048.02s)]
*  And those objects were kind of proceeding along the same line as the gimbal. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2052.1s)]
*  For my recollection, the gimbal was slightly behind that formation, an offset below it. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2056.56s)]
*  And so that formation essentially kind of just turned in a, I'll call it left-hand turn, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2062.54s)]
*  in a normal radius of turn to slightly less. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2068.22s)]
*  But they got all jumbled up. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2070.52s)]
*  So they just started turning instead of like a clean turn where they all kind of stay in [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2072.0s)]
*  the same spot, kind of a big sweeping thing. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2076.12s)]
*  Instead of that, it was a lot tighter and they kind of broke down. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2078.56s)]
*  They didn't look like they were in formation anymore in a sense. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2082.2799999999997s)]
*  They were kind of scattered about. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2084.7599999999998s)]
*  And I can't tell which one's which really out there on the radar looking at it. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2086.0s)]
*  So I don't know if they came back in the same formation, exact same position, but when they [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2089.58s)]
*  rolled out 180 degrees out, basically reverse their direction, they kind of got back into [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2094.0s)]
*  similar, if not the same formation, proceeding the opposite direction. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2098.68s)]
*  And during this time, the gimbal object, again proceeding, call it left to right, trailing [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2102.7999999999997s)]
*  this formation while it kind of executed its radius of turn, the gimbal just essentially [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2108.0s)]
*  was continuing in a straight line. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2114.54s)]
*  And then as if it pinged off a wall, just reverse direction to follow that formation [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2116.08s)]
*  once they had started flowing in the opposite direction. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2121.2999999999997s)]
*  So no turn radius. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2123.98s)]
*  Just stopped in midair and went backwards. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2124.98s)]
*  I wouldn't even say stopped. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2128.02s)]
*  It just seemed like it never stopped. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2129.2999999999997s)]
*  It just went ping. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2131.1s)]
*  And that's how we saw it from the situational awareness page, from looking down. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2134.34s)]
*  And so when you lift that up and look at it from the side, what that ping motion looks [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2139.86s)]
*  like is a U-turn, a vertical U-turn to go in the opposite direction. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2144.6s)]
*  So it climbs to reverse its turn to flow in the opposite direction within about 500 feet, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2149.48s)]
*  which is a very tight turn. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2154.7999999999997s)]
*  I think an F-18 needs like 6,000 feet or 4,000 feet to do a turn like that. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2156.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2162.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2163.36s)]
*  So there's nothing that we have as a drone that's capable of moving like that? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2164.36s)]
*  So yeah, again, if you just look at one particular case, it's like, all right, so something [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2170.4s)]
*  climbed vertically and proceeded in the opposite direction. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2174.46s)]
*  That's not the sexiest thing in the world. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2176.94s)]
*  But then let's look back in context and say, okay, we're 350 miles off the coast in protected [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2178.86s)]
*  airspace around an aircraft carrier with only fighter jets in the air. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2184.62s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, there's a formation of small objects just cruising around for [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2189.46s)]
*  a period of time that's unknown performing the least fuel efficient turns possible. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2193.78s)]
*  Like there's no concern for how fuel efficient that turn is. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2199.7000000000003s)]
*  That's like the least efficient way to do a turn. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2204.0s)]
*  And so how is an object hundreds of miles off the coast, you know, with apparently no [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2206.64s)]
*  concern for fuel hanging out next to our carrier? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2212.16s)]
*  And without the FLIR footage, you would have never been able to see these things. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2217.04s)]
*  Correct, yeah. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2221.32s)]
*  When you report this, what's the reaction? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2224.72s)]
*  Like how does that go? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2228.68s)]
*  Because we were practicing like we play at this point, getting ready for war, we were [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2231.42s)]
*  doing like a formal intel debrief after our flights, right? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2234.42s)]
*  It's kind of like, hey, we intercepted these guys and did that, another thing. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2238.06s)]
*  And so the air crew who recorded it were going down to that room to debrief it. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2241.7400000000002s)]
*  And someone told me like, hey, you know, your friend there got something interesting on [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2248.54s)]
*  the FLIR this time, you know, maybe you should go take a look or something. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2254.06s)]
*  So because I had already landed, my gear is off, you know. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2257.5s)]
*  And so I'd wait in a debrief, essentially. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2260.72s)]
*  And so I'm like, yeah, go check it out. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2263.8799999999997s)]
*  So I walked down there, you know, it's like the other side of the ship. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2265.08s)]
*  Go into classified space, all the intel folk are in there, and they're queuing up the video, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2268.7999999999997s)]
*  the tapes to watch the FLIR footage. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2273.2799999999997s)]
*  And here's an interesting thing too, right? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2276.9199999999996s)]
*  So the situational awareness page, that screen I told you about with the radar data, that's [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2279.3199999999997s)]
*  kind of in a screen that's, you know, chest level. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2284.3999999999996s)]
*  And then there's screen here, screen here, eye level on either side. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2287.6600000000003s)]
*  And if you record, we put the FLIR here, a standard procedure, in the situational awareness [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2291.9s)]
*  page down here, and then we'll have a radar up here or any of our other systems. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2297.02s)]
*  If you record the screen with the FLIR, you record the essay page automatically. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2301.7000000000003s)]
*  It's part of the same tape. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2305.5s)]
*  So what's interesting is that is that's what we watched when we were in that intel space. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2308.26s)]
*  I was able to see the FLIR footage, and that's what we just watched. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2315.4s)]
*  And then the situational awareness page with the radar data showed that as well, which [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2319.48s)]
*  showed the fleet and showed that movement I described. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2324.92s)]
*  If that FLIR footage exists, then the radar data for that event exists as well, right? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2329.2799999999997s)]
*  Because it's filmed at the same time. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2334.72s)]
*  So someone would have had to specifically split it off to get the gimbal video out without [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2336.3199999999997s)]
*  the radar data, right? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2344.3s)]
*  So the gimbal video was leaked. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2345.7400000000002s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2347.82s)]
*  I don't know the exact mechanics. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2349.3s)]
*  My understanding was that's the way it could be described, but it was done within channels [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2350.6600000000003s)]
*  that doesn't make it an illegal activity. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2354.46s)]
*  But I honestly don't know the mechanics of how it was released. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2359.02s)]
*  So somehow or another, it gets out there and it gets online, but the situational awareness [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2361.5600000000004s)]
*  page and the radar data does not. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2365.94s)]
*  You only get the FLIR footage. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2368.5800000000004s)]
*  Correct. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2370.1400000000003s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2371.1400000000003s)]
*  I think there's good reasons for that. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2372.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's overly mysterious. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2373.2799999999997s)]
*  Our radar sensor systems are our primary sensor out there. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2374.92s)]
*  They're how we employ our weapons. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2378.12s)]
*  That's all fine. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2379.92s)]
*  I think that's completely reasonable to not have that released. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2380.92s)]
*  Because it's top secret, because it would be some sort of a breach of security. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2384.0s)]
*  Yeah, it would give away how well our radar works, essentially, right? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2388.2s)]
*  But with that being said, there's still ways you can take that information and declassify [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2392.2s)]
*  it and just put the raw data out there in a sense, like the kinematics, right? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2397.44s)]
*  Okay, we're detecting objects that move like this. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2401.2599999999998s)]
*  There's no location. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2404.8199999999997s)]
*  There's no specific... [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2405.8199999999997s)]
*  There's specifics that have been kind of fleshed out. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2407.9799999999996s)]
*  There's mathematical tools that can do that with precision and certainty. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2409.7799999999997s)]
*  So there are ways to declassify that data. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2413.9799999999996s)]
*  One of the efforts that I'm doing at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2417.62s)]
*  with the UAP Community of Interest that I've helped put together, is essentially preparing [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2422.4199999999996s)]
*  teams to do that analysis. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2426.14s)]
*  We have a team of engineers, aerospace and others that have over 300 years of NASA experience, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2429.12s)]
*  at least, that are working to put together engineering and scientific UAP sensing manuals [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2436.6s)]
*  that can be updated yearly so that the information that we learn going forward in a productive [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2443.68s)]
*  manner isn't something that we need to necessarily get disclosed from the government in order [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2448.2799999999997s)]
*  to move forward on. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2453.7999999999997s)]
*  So, when you're watching the FLIR footage and you're looking at the situation awareness [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2456.8s)]
*  page and you're seeing these objects, you've already had experiences with these things [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2463.0600000000004s)]
*  by then? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2468.38s)]
*  So, the gimbal was new. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2469.38s)]
*  With something. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2470.38s)]
*  Yeah, we hadn't seen the gimbal yet, though. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2471.38s)]
*  So this is different than the other objects that you've seen. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2472.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2475.78s)]
*  So, the gimbal object at this time... [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2476.78s)]
*  What is a gimbal, by the way? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2478.2200000000003s)]
*  A spinning top. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2479.9s)]
*  That's what I think of, right? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2480.9s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2481.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2482.9s)]
*  And that induces a force that wants to keep it upright, essentially, right? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2484.8s)]
*  So, as it's spinning, you poke it and it kind of goes back to the center. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2488.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2491.0s)]
*  Again, I don't know where the names came from. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2492.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2494.0s)]
*  But this particular shape of UAP you had not witnessed before, had you heard of something [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2496.0s)]
*  like this before? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2503.1600000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2504.4s)]
*  No. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2505.4s)]
*  And let me say, it's not necessarily the shape that... [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2506.4s)]
*  Well, one gives it the name and even is what we were analyzing, right? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2510.7000000000003s)]
*  Because what we see in that video is IR energy. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2515.26s)]
*  And that could be anything. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2517.98s)]
*  Is there a plasma field there, but the surface is smaller? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2520.1400000000003s)]
*  Or is there some type of energy out there that... [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2522.98s)]
*  Or heat that is masking the shape of the object? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2525.34s)]
*  We don't really know the size or the physical shape of the object from that image. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2527.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2532.5s)]
*  You're just getting the signature. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2533.5s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2534.5s)]
*  So, when everyone is observing this, how many people were in the room with you when this [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2535.5s)]
*  was going down? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2539.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2540.18s)]
*  There's maybe like 15 or so. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2541.18s)]
*  A lot of intel people, a handful of aviators, and then of course the air crew. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2542.52s)]
*  What's the reaction? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2548.6s)]
*  Everyone just kind of looking around at each other, just kind of like, holy shit. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2550.04s)]
*  There was no like, oh, that's prosaic or that's... [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2553.94s)]
*  There was no conclusions drawn, but everyone just kind of had no idea what it was. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2557.72s)]
*  And the people that were in there, had they also used this upgraded equipment so they [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2561.24s)]
*  were all aware that there was something going on out there? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2566.0s)]
*  This is a narrative that's being discussed? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2569.58s)]
*  All the aviators, yeah. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2571.18s)]
*  So everyone kind of knows that you're not alone out there? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2573.18s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2576.18s)]
*  I don't even know how many of the intel folks knew at this point, but I mean, at least our [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2577.18s)]
*  squadron intel guy did, and I know a handful of others, but I honestly don't know how many [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2580.66s)]
*  of the intel folks were aware at this point. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2586.06s)]
*  Is there a discussion about how much of this can you talk about openly? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2588.12s)]
*  Is everyone going, huh? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2595.86s)]
*  What is it like? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2597.94s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much that, huh? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2598.96s)]
*  And kind of just waiting for someone to provide some leadership on this. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2600.56s)]
*  So I'm like, what the fuck? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2603.92s)]
*  What leadership is available if an alien spacecraft shows up? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2607.12s)]
*  Well, apparently they called the admiral, right? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2610.28s)]
*  So they're like, let's see what the admiral thinks. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2612.12s)]
*  And so I kind of slowly walked into the shadows and no one kicked me out. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2614.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2619.56s)]
*  Because you want to know. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2620.56s)]
*  Yeah, I want to see what his reaction at least was. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2621.56s)]
*  And he came down a couple minutes and he watched it for like five, six seconds and just turned [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2624.78s)]
*  around and was like, just walked out. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2630.62s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2632.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2633.82s)]
*  So I was like, I think he's clearly seen this before. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2634.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2636.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2637.94s)]
*  That's why I saw it. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2638.94s)]
*  That would immediately be my thought. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2639.94s)]
*  If he's just going, huh? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2640.94s)]
*  Like, unless he's so fucking jaded, the guy's seen so much shit. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2642.74s)]
*  That's what might be worse. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2646.46s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2647.46s)]
*  Yeah, maybe he needs to retire, buddy. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2648.46s)]
*  He's seen too much shit. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2651.1s)]
*  I would imagine if that's his reaction, that this is something that he's observed before. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2653.0s)]
*  So fast forward a couple of years and we'll come back. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2658.0s)]
*  But I at this point talked to various people on the hill and had been involved with some [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2660.12s)]
*  people that had looked into this. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2667.52s)]
*  And one of them mentioned to me, hey, your inclination was correct. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2668.76s)]
*  After he saw that video, he essentially came back and called us to report that these fucking [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2675.12s)]
*  objects were still in his airspace and were looking for some type of answer of what to [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2680.1800000000003s)]
*  do about them. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2685.5800000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2687.26s)]
*  And was there any sort of conclusion? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2688.26s)]
*  Is there any sort of protocol that gets established afterwards to what to do when you encounter [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2691.7400000000002s)]
*  these things? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2697.6600000000003s)]
*  So to answer that in the worst way possible, we walked back to our ready room and of course [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2698.6600000000003s)]
*  then we're all talking about it and like, well, what's this? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2705.26s)]
*  We've seen the other objects. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2708.08s)]
*  From the best we could tell, the formation represented the objects we were used to seeing [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2709.84s)]
*  off the East Coast. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2714.32s)]
*  But the gimbal was new. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2715.32s)]
*  And now we're building theories because it's like, well, this is different. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2717.0s)]
*  We're starting to get a little more interested. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2719.92s)]
*  Essentially someone just came in and just said that was enough, essentially. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2722.32s)]
*  Stopped talking about it? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2725.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2726.44s)]
*  And it wasn't like here's an NDA or anything like that. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2727.44s)]
*  It wasn't really even anyone in a position to order that if they wanted to. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2730.08s)]
*  But it was still just like, all right, just another weird thing here at this point. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2732.96s)]
*  Because again, we're in a super stressful time, right? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2737.78s)]
*  18 hour days, it's a stressful time. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2740.1400000000003s)]
*  But yeah, I look back and I feel like I have to defend that decision because it's like, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2744.0600000000004s)]
*  why weren't you more curious? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2748.7000000000003s)]
*  Why weren't you more into it? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2749.7000000000003s)]
*  Why didn't you think to explore this part of it? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2752.5400000000004s)]
*  But yeah, we were just busy. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2755.6600000000003s)]
*  We were just so focused on what we were doing and trying to do the best we could. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2758.26s)]
*  You guys are alone. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2763.24s)]
*  Like if you're having dinner or you're just alone having a beer, do these things come [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2765.12s)]
*  up in conversation? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2770.8s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2772.04s)]
*  Especially over a beer. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2773.52s)]
*  Are there more different shapes and more different types of these objects? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2775.68s)]
*  The observations off the East Coast, we talked to other people in other squadrons with similar [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2783.28s)]
*  capabilities and they were describing it the same way. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2788.08s)]
*  The Cuban sphere. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2791.28s)]
*  Same color, same everything. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2792.68s)]
*  And does that seem indicative of things that you only see on the East Coast? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2794.62s)]
*  So far as I know, again, I wish there was a better place to answer these questions. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2799.44s)]
*  But part of the reason I don't have answers is because we've just refused to look at this [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2804.62s)]
*  for so long, right? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2807.94s)]
*  There's just never been data collections so far as I know. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2809.3799999999997s)]
*  And so that would be questions we could answer if we had started looking at this 20 years [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2813.06s)]
*  ago perhaps that we could be answering now. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2818.46s)]
*  We have to collect a lot of data. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2821.6800000000003s)]
*  It's interesting because we have really two ways of doing that. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2824.7000000000003s)]
*  There's leveraging the world's best sensors and things of that nature through the US government. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2829.26s)]
*  And of course all that is always going to be classified and it's always going to be difficult. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2833.98s)]
*  And then on the other hand, there's really discovery. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2839.1400000000003s)]
*  We don't have to just wait for the government to tell us what's right and what's wrong, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2843.5800000000004s)]
*  what's real on this topic. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2847.78s)]
*  We are in an age now where technology and democratization of tools essentially and access [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2850.02s)]
*  to space is moving it so we can verify and move the topic forward without being handfed [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2854.98s)]
*  perhaps from the people with the world's greatest sensors. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2862.18s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2864.98s)]
*  Yeah, it does make sense. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2866.3s)]
*  How many different types of these objects have you heard other people discuss? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2869.34s)]
*  There's the circle that has the cube inside of it. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2874.7s)]
*  There's this gimbal thing which you don't really necessarily know what the shape is. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2879.14s)]
*  But have people witnessed eyewitness accounts other than Commander David Fravor described [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2883.2599999999998s)]
*  something that he said looked like a tic tac. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2888.1s)]
*  I believe he said it was somewhere in the neighborhood of like 25 feet wide. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2890.66s)]
*  Is that what something sounds right? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2894.58s)]
*  So there's three, right? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2898.3799999999997s)]
*  You don't know what the gimbal, the physical shape of it is. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2900.1s)]
*  Then you have the circle with the cube inside of it and then you have the tic tac. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2903.1s)]
*  Are there more? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2908.62s)]
*  Probably. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2910.66s)]
*  Have you talked to someone who's seen others? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2911.66s)]
*  On the East Coast, we were typically seeing what I've described to you. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2915.38s)]
*  All up and down. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2918.8599999999997s)]
*  So even up in the Patuxik River area outside of DC, people were seeing them up there at [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2919.8599999999997s)]
*  the test pilot area. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2925.2599999999998s)]
*  On the West Coast, like you said, I've heard the tic tac description multiple times. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2927.2599999999998s)]
*  Once kind of the word got out, I think about the cube a bit and people were looking and [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2933.7799999999997s)]
*  paying attention. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2937.5s)]
*  I started to hear about those being observed in other areas such as the West Coast and [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2938.5s)]
*  further inland actually around other bases. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2942.98s)]
*  But we still don't know necessarily if we're observing things there because they're there [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2946.58s)]
*  or because we just happen to have the sensors there. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2951.7000000000003s)]
*  It could be in more places. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2953.82s)]
*  We're just not necessarily looking there. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2954.94s)]
*  So there's a huge aspect right now to observation bias. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2956.42s)]
*  In 2017, it was kind of a milestone moment for UFO just a discussion because the New [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2960.74s)]
*  York Times printed a story. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2971.06s)]
*  And once it was on the front page of the New York Times, it was like, okay, this is a serious [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2973.3399999999997s)]
*  magazine or the serious newspaper. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2978.2599999999998s)]
*  And you have a serious discussion now about this thing that had been for a long time been [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2981.06s)]
*  ridiculed. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2985.8199999999997s)]
*  And then the Pentagon discusses it. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2987.66s)]
*  You start hearing people. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2990.2599999999998s)]
*  Why do you think that's happening? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2992.2599999999998s)]
*  What is it about this subject? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2994.8599999999997s)]
*  It must have been for you in 2014 very bizarre when you have this new radar system that starts [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=2996.46s)]
*  detecting these things. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3002.46s)]
*  Now you get this understanding of the fact that these things are there all the time. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3003.8999999999996s)]
*  You just haven't been able to put eyes on them and you haven't had equipment that measured [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3007.3799999999997s)]
*  them accurately. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3012.06s)]
*  Now you do. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3013.48s)]
*  And now there's this discussion of it in the New York Times. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3014.66s)]
*  What do you think is going on? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3017.54s)]
*  At the end of the day, I wish I had an answer for you. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3019.34s)]
*  I don't. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3024.34s)]
*  But from where I'm sitting, I see a lot of people that seem to be paying attention more [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3025.34s)]
*  so now, especially after that article came out, myself included. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3031.38s)]
*  I was part of it. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3034.9s)]
*  I was a witness to it. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3035.9s)]
*  But just like everyone else, I kind of just let it be part of my history until I saw that [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3036.9s)]
*  article pop on the New York Times. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3041.02s)]
*  And I don't know why we are moving the conversation forward. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3044.7s)]
*  Chris Mellon talked about it. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3051.3399999999997s)]
*  I've listened to Lou talk about it. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3052.5s)]
*  It's very simple when I talk about it because it's very simple. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3056.2599999999998s)]
*  There are objects out there that our aviators are almost hitting. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3060.74s)]
*  For me, whenever I engage this topic, it's always from that perspective of aviation safety. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3064.66s)]
*  It's never really engaging on this crazy, ontological wave. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3071.42s)]
*  It's me just working on a problem that I was trained for by the Navy. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3076.6800000000003s)]
*  I was trained to be an aviation safety officer. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3079.94s)]
*  I see the signs of the safety problem brewing. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3083.26s)]
*  People don't want to talk about it. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3087.1800000000003s)]
*  It's taboo. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3088.26s)]
*  That's not how aviation safety works. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3089.42s)]
*  It doesn't live in silence in a cone like that. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3091.38s)]
*  You need to share lessons learned. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3094.86s)]
*  The government gets it now. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3097.2200000000003s)]
*  The DOD gets it. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3098.42s)]
*  That's why the aircrew have a reporting mechanism now. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3099.5s)]
*  They can come back after their flight after they've seen one of these objects and they [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3102.14s)]
*  can report it. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3106.2400000000002s)]
*  I understand that reporting mechanism has an area where they can describe the shape [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3107.82s)]
*  of it. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3111.7s)]
*  So my hope is we can answer that question of yours once that data gets released. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3112.7s)]
*  I hope it will at some point. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3117.94s)]
*  It's classified at the moment. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3119.26s)]
*  Do you have any understanding of how often these things get reported? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3120.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know how often they're getting reported. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3124.7s)]
*  My fear is that if aviators don't get feedback from the work you're doing, they're going [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3126.86s)]
*  to stop reporting. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3130.6600000000003s)]
*  If you just keep reporting a safety hazard every day and it's just data collection and [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3133.02s)]
*  nothing solves it, then eventually you're just going to say, what's the point? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3136.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm going to just do my thing. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3139.98s)]
*  I've seen some declassified pilot reports. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3141.94s)]
*  Some of these were from the UAP Task Force report that came out last year. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3144.94s)]
*  They're fascinating. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3151.7000000000003s)]
*  The pilots are curious. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3152.7000000000003s)]
*  They're seeing things they don't understand. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3153.98s)]
*  They're seeing these interesting objects, massive winds. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3155.58s)]
*  They're seeing formations of objects flying around, behaving in ways they don't understand. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3158.94s)]
*  And they're looking for more. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3163.86s)]
*  They're saying, hey, if you have any more questions, please reach back to me on classified [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3165.2999999999997s)]
*  if you need to. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3169.14s)]
*  And my fear is that if they don't get that information back, that engagement with people [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3170.46s)]
*  collecting that data, it's going to taper off. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3173.98s)]
*  So I just wanted to make the plea that we consider that it's a two-way conversation with those [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3176.2599999999998s)]
*  air crew. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3180.62s)]
*  Christopher Mellon, when I talked to him, he was saying that there's a lot more data, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3182.5s)]
*  a lot more evidence out there that hasn't been released. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3190.1800000000003s)]
*  And his understanding of it is that what you're seeing is just the tip of the iceberg and [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3194.3s)]
*  that there's high resolution photos and videos and that some of it is, for lack of a better [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3199.1000000000004s)]
*  word, disturbing. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3206.26s)]
*  Because you're looking at something that doesn't make any sense in terms of what we understand. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3207.7000000000003s)]
*  What's physically possible with the technology that we have access to today? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3212.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3218.94s)]
*  I have some volunteers within the AIAA work that have been in a position to do that. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3219.94s)]
*  Now that, again, there's been a new reporting mechanism. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3226.2200000000003s)]
*  We're kind of moving into a new age with this. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3228.6600000000003s)]
*  I can't speak to all the data that may be out there for the past X years. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3231.42s)]
*  Again, it comes with a lot of assumptions and a lot of unanswered questions. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3237.06s)]
*  But from the new reports that they've started fresh with the Navy, and I applaud them for [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3242.58s)]
*  standing up and taking the lead on that, the reports that we see is that this has continued [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3247.18s)]
*  to be a problem that is occurring. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3252.62s)]
*  The number of objects, they seem to be increasing. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3255.02s)]
*  It seems to be happening everywhere we're looking. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3259.2999999999997s)]
*  Navy bases on the West Coast, in other places in the US, on the East Coast, we're seeing them. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3262.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'll just stop there for a minute. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3271.2200000000003s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3273.2200000000003s)]
*  I do that occasionally. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3274.2200000000003s)]
*  It's such a squirrely subject, man. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3276.06s)]
*  And I'm really fascinated by the fact that these sightings seem to occur on a regular [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3278.98s)]
*  basis over the ocean. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3284.1s)]
*  And Jeremy Corbell, who has had video leaked to him, I use the air quotes leaked because [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3287.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know exactly how this is happening or why it's happening. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3294.5800000000004s)]
*  I assume they're focusing on him because he's capable of releasing it in a very high profile [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3298.6600000000003s)]
*  way. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3304.7000000000003s)]
*  If he releases it, people are going to pay attention. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3305.7000000000003s)]
*  But one of the videos is of a transmedium device, something that is apparently someone [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3307.96s)]
*  in the military filmed this, that it was flying above the ocean and then went into the ocean. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3315.46s)]
*  When you're seeing all these things, they appear around the ocean. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3322.46s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3328.66s)]
*  Do you have any speculation? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3329.66s)]
*  Well, you know, we're pretty blind down there at the end of the day, right? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3334.66s)]
*  We don't have as good a SAO, say, or as much presence in the ocean as we do in the air, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3340.18s)]
*  I would say. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3348.18s)]
*  Yeah, we do have a lot of sensors and we can likely see certain things, but radiation, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3349.18s)]
*  electromagnetic radiation doesn't propagate very well through water like that. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3355.94s)]
*  So in a way, it's kind of a good place to hide, I would suggest. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3360.2599999999998s)]
*  There's talks of hydrogen being a useful fuel source, you know, and of course plenty of [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3365.18s)]
*  hydrogen in the water. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3369.0s)]
*  But this is all just pure speculation. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3371.42s)]
*  I really don't know at the end of the day. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3373.0s)]
*  But when we, you know, the video that you mentioned with that kind of transmedium behavior [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3374.88s)]
*  went directly into the object like that. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3381.24s)]
*  I'll just say that, you know, that is very unique to see objects like that. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3384.8s)]
*  People argue about the shape or anything like that. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3390.72s)]
*  But even if, you know, these objects are coming from, call it a near-peer threat, right? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3393.0s)]
*  And they're still able to do these types of behaviors. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3400.84s)]
*  At the end of the day, it really comes down to technological surprise, right? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3403.88s)]
*  Whether that's an adversary on Earth or whether that's, you know, something else. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3407.24s)]
*  It's the same process of understanding what the capabilities are so that, you know, come [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3411.58s)]
*  in 2024, 2025, you know, we don't have, you know, a surprise that we can't counter, whether [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3416.44s)]
*  that's, you know, hypersonic object flying around that happened to be UAP or whether [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3421.74s)]
*  they happen to be missiles, right? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3427.06s)]
*  It's essentially the same problem. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3428.3799999999997s)]
*  The problem is, yeah, we don't know if that's coming from an adversary or whether it's coming [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3430.4199999999996s)]
*  from an alien. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3434.3399999999997s)]
*  And so we don't know how to react, whether this thing is observing us or whether this [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3436.2599999999998s)]
*  thing is an actual physical threat. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3440.2999999999997s)]
*  I've used the word threat before. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3446.1s)]
*  For me as a pilot, when an aircraft is flying around out there and they're not talking to [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3448.66s)]
*  me, right? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3453.34s)]
*  Like say they came into my area and I'm the only one out there and there's an interloper. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3454.34s)]
*  That aircraft's a threat to me. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3459.18s)]
*  It doesn't mean he has hostile intent necessarily, but my aircraft could be lost if I have a [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3461.74s)]
*  midair. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3466.22s)]
*  If I start doing some tactics and I forget he's there and now I'm, you know, zorting [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3467.22s)]
*  through his altitude. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3470.38s)]
*  So he's a threat, very simply. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3471.38s)]
*  It doesn't mean it's a bad guy or he's got, you know, explosives on his plane. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3472.82s)]
*  It's the same way when I talk about these being a threat for aviators out there. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3477.7400000000002s)]
*  It is a safety hazard. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3481.9s)]
*  Someone could die. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3483.38s)]
*  We could lose aircraft. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3484.38s)]
*  I don't think that these objects are displaying hostile intent out there. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3485.38s)]
*  But even just observation and collection of our, you know, electronic warfare, our communications, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3490.3s)]
*  our radar frequency, all that information, if it was an earthly threat, you know, that [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3496.1000000000004s)]
*  would be very useful information that they could look the back engineer. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3501.46s)]
*  Has there ever been any sort of design or discussion of some sort of a craft that can [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3505.46s)]
*  operate in a transmedium way that can fly through the air and then go into the ocean? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3513.94s)]
*  Nothing that I've seen that's been created, really. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3519.7000000000003s)]
*  How would a propulsion system work that would go from the air into the ocean with based [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3522.66s)]
*  on what we understand about the abilities that we have today? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3530.58s)]
*  You know, on the surface, like to go from air to water isn't necessarily a complete [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3535.58s)]
*  challenge, right? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3541.66s)]
*  Like you can imagine something that can get dropped in the ocean and perhaps move around [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3542.66s)]
*  or some type of mini submarine that comes up and then launches a UAV, right, and flies [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3545.7799999999997s)]
*  away. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3552.18s)]
*  But just to be clear to people listening, that's not necessarily what we're talking [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3553.18s)]
*  about. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3555.9s)]
*  We're talking about an object that is moving at a relatively, you know, quick pace and [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3556.9s)]
*  enters the water as if it wasn't there. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3562.02s)]
*  Is that what you understand? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3564.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3565.7400000000002s)]
*  The way I understand it is it just went right into the water. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3566.7400000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, that's incredibly interesting for a number of reasons. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3569.98s)]
*  You know, propulsion in the air versus propulsion in the water is, you know, typically pretty [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3574.06s)]
*  different. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3578.62s)]
*  And once you start talking about high speeds underwater, that kind of goes out the door. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3579.62s)]
*  You know, high speeds underwater, 200 miles an hour or higher, is not like 200 miles in [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3583.7000000000003s)]
*  the air. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3589.26s)]
*  So when I think of something that can operate in both, the first thing I think of is that, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3591.1000000000004s)]
*  you know, neither are concerned because of its operating system, whether that's air friction [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3595.6600000000003s)]
*  or whether that's, you know, the water drag that it would be exposed to. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3600.0600000000004s)]
*  That's like the first kind of like out there thought as far as how this could operate. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3603.46s)]
*  It would somehow be affecting, you know, the air or the water, right, the liquid around [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3606.98s)]
*  it to move it around the aircraft or to, you know, negate the effect of all that force, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3611.3s)]
*  right? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3617.0600000000004s)]
*  So underwater, just so much pressure, so much friction that it's just so hard to go fast. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3618.06s)]
*  Did you watch that Jeremy Corbell documentary, Bablazar Area 51 and Flying Saucers? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3624.54s)]
*  I did. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3630.7799999999997s)]
*  I did. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3631.7799999999997s)]
*  What did you think of that? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3632.7799999999997s)]
*  It was interesting, you know. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3633.7799999999997s)]
*  I got a cool story for you here. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3636.06s)]
*  When I was a kid, I was an avid explorer of the Internet. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3638.2599999999998s)]
*  And I had stumbled upon what I thought at the time was the coolest possible website [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3642.7s)]
*  ever. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3646.2999999999997s)]
*  This guy selling all sorts of radioactive rocks and cool scientific equipment. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3647.2999999999997s)]
*  And I was like, this is the coolest website. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3652.3799999999997s)]
*  This is why the Internet was built. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3653.8999999999996s)]
*  And fast forward many years later, I learned that that was Bob's website. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3656.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, United Nuclear. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3661.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3662.62s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3663.62s)]
*  I heard it. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3664.62s)]
*  It might have been in that movie actually or the documentary. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3665.62s)]
*  And yeah, I was like, holy smokes. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3667.5s)]
*  That's that guy. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3669.62s)]
*  But you know, the story's fascinating. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3671.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't want to say I believe or disbelieve because this is such a controversial area [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3676.1s)]
*  when people start drawing these conclusions. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3682.1s)]
*  So I want to be able to establish the ability to do real science on this topic. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3684.2999999999997s)]
*  I want to be able to get a material or to get a bit of information and have a real peer [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3692.14s)]
*  review process that is going to look at that information objectively without the stigma [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3698.74s)]
*  that you have had. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3703.66s)]
*  Even Bob's story comes with people either hate it or love it. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3706.66s)]
*  It's very controversial. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3710.78s)]
*  But then the day data is data. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3711.78s)]
*  And if we can perhaps get element 115 or some other thing that could be used to do an analyst [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3714.14s)]
*  and we can write papers, we'll have a process to take that forward and be able to say, hey, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3720.9s)]
*  here's now a flag in the sand that we can kind of move science forward on on this unique [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3726.02s)]
*  topic. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3730.42s)]
*  The people that haven't seen the documentary, what Ryan's referring to with element 115 [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3731.58s)]
*  is something that Bob talked about in the late 80s. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3737.58s)]
*  And what he describes is a reactor that uses this element called 115 that was theoretical [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3741.9s)]
*  in the late 80s but then proven somewhere in the 2000s. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3749.86s)]
*  Was it like 2009 or something like that? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3755.06s)]
*  It was proven through a particle collider where they were able to detect it when they [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3762.22s)]
*  have these particles and they can detect them for a very short period of time. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3768.74s)]
*  But they know now that it's not just theoretical, this element 115 is an actual element. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3774.58s)]
*  In the first discussions that Bob Lazar had about this, he claimed that there was a stable [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3781.06s)]
*  supply, a stable version of element 115 and that this element 115 was used to make some [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3787.7s)]
*  sort of a gravity field and that was the method of propulsion that these crafts were using. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3796.02s)]
*  And that they exhibited a method of flight that is very similar to the gimbal. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3803.3799999999997s)]
*  The way he described it, and this is again in the late 80s, that this thing would be [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3812.62s)]
*  traveling and then it would turn and rotate vertically and that it would then travel in [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3817.46s)]
*  that would be somehow or another this element 115 with this reactor would create this some [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3826.18s)]
*  sort of a field that allows it to bend gravity and bend space and time around it. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3833.62s)]
*  The way he described it is the way it uses a propulsion system, say if you had an incredibly [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3839.06s)]
*  heavy bowling ball and you put it in the middle of a mattress and it sort of pushes the mattress [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3843.7s)]
*  down, that's what this thing is doing to space. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3848.74s)]
*  Instead of firing flames out the back, it's doing something with this element that's allowing [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3854.2999999999997s)]
*  it to travel in an incredibly fast way. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3860.62s)]
*  When you listen to Commander David Fravor's depiction of that Tic-Tac object, one of the [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3865.62s)]
*  things that's incredible is that they detected this object at more than 50,000 feet above [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3872.7s)]
*  sea level and then it went from above 50,000 feet to 50 feet in less than a second, which [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3878.98s)]
*  is just bonkers. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3886.18s)]
*  Who the fuck knows what could do that with no visual propulsion system, no visible, no [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3888.8999999999996s)]
*  understanding of how this thing is moving around. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3894.46s)]
*  But the fact that Bob Lazar was describing that actual method of propulsion back in the [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3898.26s)]
*  late 80s, it's trippy. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3903.54s)]
*  I wish, I wish, if he's a liar, he's one of the best liars of all time and what a great [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3907.02s)]
*  con he's been running because he's been telling the exact same story the exact same way for [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3912.7s)]
*  more than 30 years. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3917.86s)]
*  It's really crazy and you don't know what to think. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3920.2200000000003s)]
*  I talked to the guy, I had dinner with him and then I talked to him on the podcast and [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3923.18s)]
*  I like to think I have a fairly decent bullshit detector, but I don't know. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3928.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3933.5s)]
*  I mean, he's obviously a brilliant guy, a legitimate scientist, incredibly intelligent. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3934.5s)]
*  He would have been called out and he kind of has about his education record, but he [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3939.66s)]
*  explained that to me and I'll explain it to you afterwards, like what he told me that [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3945.8199999999997s)]
*  he doesn't want discussed publicly. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3949.5s)]
*  But it's so strange that the way this guy was talking about these objects back in the [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3951.58s)]
*  late 80s is exactly how we're observing them behave today and that he was saying that the [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3960.46s)]
*  United States government had these things in their possession and they were attempting [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3968.14s)]
*  to back engineer them and they hired him, a propulsion expert, to try to figure them [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3972.2599999999998s)]
*  out. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3977.74s)]
*  So that's element 115. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3979.06s)]
*  So when you are watching this documentary and him explaining this and talking about [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3980.94s)]
*  area S4, which is where he was supposedly working on these things, what's your sense [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3987.94s)]
*  of that? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3996.46s)]
*  I try to stay agnostic in a sense because I think probably like most people, I want [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=3999.2200000000003s)]
*  to believe it. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4005.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's the problem. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4006.02s)]
*  It's super interesting. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4007.02s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4008.02s)]
*  A very deep pardon me just as like, man, I want all that to be true. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4009.1s)]
*  It's super cool. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4013.66s)]
*  And so in a sense, that's what kind of pushes me away from it, you know, because I don't [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4016.38s)]
*  have any tools to prevent that from taking over, right? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4021.06s)]
*  Like I don't have any data or anything other than just that. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4024.54s)]
*  But that's okay. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4029.18s)]
*  That's what we've dealt with, I think, in the past. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4031.38s)]
*  But you know, I think and I believe and I hope that as we move forward, we're going [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4033.38s)]
*  to be dealing with this in a new way, right? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4037.98s)]
*  It's going to be about planting flags and moving the conversation forward with data [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4039.14s)]
*  and science. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4045.66s)]
*  And there's some, you know, another reason again, this could be happening now is that [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4046.66s)]
*  there's just better tools, right? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4050.82s)]
*  Our technology is getting better. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4052.26s)]
*  We in a sense have, you know, another non-human intelligence on earth with us right now, right? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4055.34s)]
*  With our advancement machine learning and artificial intelligence, you know, those tools [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4059.78s)]
*  might give us information, insight into these behaviors in a way that we wouldn't obviously [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4065.42s)]
*  put together, right? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4070.6600000000003s)]
*  That's what ML does best. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4071.6600000000003s)]
*  And so I see great, I see great promise for us having a better understanding of some of [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4073.82s)]
*  these mysteries kind of when we bring in that tool to show us things that we just, you know, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4079.98s)]
*  our brains aren't well suited to find those patterns. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4084.2200000000003s)]
*  So part of the problem with all this stuff is the fact that it's not openly discussed. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4087.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4093.5s)]
*  I know that you were brought in for a hearing. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4096.0199999999995s)]
*  Was this in front of Congress? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4099.54s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4101.42s)]
*  So you know, way back when, when this kind of got kicked off, I had a private meeting [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4102.86s)]
*  with members of the Senate Armed Service Committee and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4106.66s)]
*  And what was that like? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4111.78s)]
*  Pretty nerve wracking. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4113.54s)]
*  I mean, I was, you know, yeah. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4114.54s)]
*  So you know, it was funny. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4116.9s)]
*  I, you know, I volunteered to do this in a sense and I was like, listen, I realize that, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4118.34s)]
*  you know, I'm active duty right now. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4123.0199999999995s)]
*  This is definitely not like, you know, I can't represent the Navy here or the military, right? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4124.82s)]
*  I have to just try to speak as a citizen the best I can. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4130.179999999999s)]
*  So I was like, I'm not going to wear my uniform. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4133.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm just going to go as, you know, as Ryan, not Lieutenant Graves, hopefully. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4134.58s)]
*  And I ended up getting a call at like 930, 10 at night, the night before I was about [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4141.379999999999s)]
*  to leave, essentially saying, get your, get your uniform ready because you're now on orders [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4146.379999999999s)]
*  to go up there to have that conversation and you'll be in uniform. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4152.6s)]
*  And this was like months before I'm getting out of the Navy. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4157.240000000001s)]
*  So like my shit's all packed up, you know, like I'm like calling friends at like, and [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4159.72s)]
*  some of the stuff I ship back home already, you know, like back up to New England. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4164.6s)]
*  I'm in Mississippi at this time. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4168.04s)]
*  So I'm calling my squadron mates at like, you know, 10, 11 at night, trying to like [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4169.4400000000005s)]
*  get uniform pieces to pass together. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4174.08s)]
*  Like, oh shit, here's the worst part, right? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4176.0s)]
*  So I'm in there, you know, some very serious people in there. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4178.740000000001s)]
*  One of them is a former Admiral and now he's a staffer essentially. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4182.36s)]
*  And like all the questions and, you know, having the whole conversation near the end, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4187.679999999999s)]
*  he's like, he's like, so I noticed that you're missing a ribbon or a uniform because I had [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4191.44s)]
*  to have that rack right here. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4197.24s)]
*  And there's one you get like every time you kind of leave a squadron. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4198.24s)]
*  They're no, you know, no big deal, but I didn't have it. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4201.799999999999s)]
*  It's just like the stores were closed. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4204.48s)]
*  I couldn't get it in time. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4205.96s)]
*  He's like, did you leave your squadron? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4206.96s)]
*  Did you leave your squadron on a bad note? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4208.42s)]
*  You know, because I didn't have that metal. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4210.2s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4212.0s)]
*  No, but he was pretty cool about it. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4213.0s)]
*  But yeah, that was probably the most stressful part. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4214.320000000001s)]
*  You have to explain the whole thing that you didn't know you were coming in uniform? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4215.88s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4217.68s)]
*  I just told the story. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4218.68s)]
*  I just told you. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4219.68s)]
*  They loved it. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4220.68s)]
*  Well, I'm sure they probably like thought it was funny that you were so nervous about [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4221.68s)]
*  it too. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4226.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm at a table, not unlike this one, but much bigger. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4227.84s)]
*  And I'm, you know, at the head of the table here. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4231.76s)]
*  And on your side is like all the DOD folk and like executive branch representation. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4232.96s)]
*  On the other side is all the SAS and Senate Intelligence folks. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4238.28s)]
*  And I got essentially walked over by a handful of admirals that were in various roles from [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4242.64s)]
*  that point. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4250.400000000001s)]
*  This was an unexpected part of my trip. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4251.400000000001s)]
*  I was supposed to just go talk to them. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4253.6s)]
*  But part of me coming in uniform was that I needed to have a conversation at the Pentagon [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4255.400000000001s)]
*  right prior to that. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4258.96s)]
*  To what to discuss and what not to? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4261.24s)]
*  No. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4263.16s)]
*  At the time, it was just kind of like to get, you know, a pre-brief, essentially, is how [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4264.4s)]
*  they described it. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4267.96s)]
*  But and that's all it was. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4268.96s)]
*  There was nothing nefarious. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4269.96s)]
*  They really just wanted to hear it from the horse's mouth, you know, before they escorted [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4270.96s)]
*  me across the hill. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4274.599999999999s)]
*  And what were the questions? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4276.04s)]
*  Like what was the nature of the discussion? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4278.08s)]
*  Which one? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4282.08s)]
*  When you sat down in front of everyone? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4283.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4284.4s)]
*  I mean, essentially, you know, what's the story? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4285.4s)]
*  You know, what do you see? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4287.639999999999s)]
*  And not unlike, you know, a lot of the things I told you about here, you know, did people [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4288.639999999999s)]
*  ridicule you? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4293.0s)]
*  Did they, you know, people tell you not to talk about it? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4294.04s)]
*  There was a concern, it seemed like, from those, from the non-DOD folks that they were [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4297.8s)]
*  wondering if there was any influence on me to, you know, either downplay or not talk [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4303.16s)]
*  about it. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4307.84s)]
*  So they, and there was none, you know, to be clear. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4308.84s)]
*  But that was, you know, they questioned me on that. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4311.32s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it was essentially, you know, they seemed earnestly, you know, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4313.92s)]
*  interested in getting the bottom of what we were seeing out there. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4318.2s)]
*  They seemed to ask a lot of good questions that couldn't be answered in that, at that [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4321.5199999999995s)]
*  space in that classification level. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4326.76s)]
*  So you know, they were having a follow up conversation after I left. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4329.08s)]
*  But that was really the kickoff of, you know, me speaking about this in official fashion, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4332.5599999999995s)]
*  right? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4341.04s)]
*  To like actual decision makers, things of that nature versus media, essentially. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4342.04s)]
*  Is there discussion about media? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4345.92s)]
*  Was there discussion about how you were allowed to talk about this or how much of this is [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4348.72s)]
*  classified? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4353.0s)]
*  So you know, the whole boat situation, right, with Gimbal, people were like, all right, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4355.4400000000005s)]
*  we're done talk about this. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4359.400000000001s)]
*  But you know, there's, that's not how classification works, right? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4360.4800000000005s)]
*  There's NEAs and paperwork. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4363.320000000001s)]
*  Like, so, you know, the short answer is no, like, this was never information that was [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4364.320000000001s)]
*  classified. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4367.8s)]
*  Like, I never, you know, I wouldn't have spoke about it if it was unclassified. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4368.8s)]
*  And yet I thought it was inappropriately unclassified and could cause, you know, natural damage [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4372.88s)]
*  or anything like that, right? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4377.88s)]
*  I understood it was like a new thing. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4379.08s)]
*  But I was, I was, and at least in my mind, doing what I thought was best. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4380.76s)]
*  But it was not classified information. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4385.56s)]
*  It was, it was, it was not information at the time, right? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4387.64s)]
*  It just, it wasn't a thing. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4391.6s)]
*  Now there's a program. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4393.360000000001s)]
*  Now there's a reporting program. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4394.360000000001s)]
*  The UAP task force, you know, collects reports. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4395.360000000001s)]
*  Now it's a classified reporting program. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4397.9800000000005s)]
*  So I don't expect people that, you know, to be quote unquote leaking or talking about [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4399.72s)]
*  it publicly anymore due to it being a real operation now, which is a good thing. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4404.4s)]
*  Have you had any conversations with anyone at a high level that gives you an understanding [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4409.08s)]
*  of what they think these things are? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4414.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4417.28s)]
*  You know, not, not to the specificity, I think that you would like or anyone would like, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4418.96s)]
*  but you know, there are efforts standing up within DOD, with the error office, with, you [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4424.799999999999s)]
*  know, some of the intelligence authorization act language from last year and also this [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4429.32s)]
*  year. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4432.88s)]
*  The language and the efforts that are being established to look into this are doing so [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4436.24s)]
*  under the context that there is a large category of other, right? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4440.4800000000005s)]
*  That we just simply don't understand. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4444.32s)]
*  It's you know, we're not, the systems are being designed and built and organizations [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4446.8s)]
*  aren't there to better understand, you know, the Chinese threat that might be off our shores, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4450.68s)]
*  right? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4456.28s)]
*  Like if that, if that's identified, then it gets routed to the proper place and then they'll [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4457.28s)]
*  go back to doing their job on the mysterious stuff that's still out there, right? [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4460.5199999999995s)]
*  So you know, that's how the efforts are being organized right now. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4463.759999999999s)]
*  And now what the output of that investigation is going to be, whether it's, you know, aliens [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4467.44s)]
*  or any of the other million of hypothesis is unknown at this point, but it is mysterious. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4471.16s)]
*  It's not the prosaic that they're establishing these channels for. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4476.799999999999s)]
*  So it really is an unknown in even at the highest levels. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4482.04s)]
*  Other than what Commander Fravor described and what the equipment detected in terms of [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4489.2s)]
*  speed, the movement of that thing. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4494.44s)]
*  And then another disturbing thing was that the object when it took off at extraordinary [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4496.96s)]
*  rates of speed after they had detected it, it went to their cat point, which is very [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4502.76s)]
*  interesting. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4507.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4508.08s)]
*  Because they had a predetermined place where they were supposed to meet up and this thing [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4509.08s)]
*  went there. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4511.72s)]
*  Like it could read their plans. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4512.96s)]
*  Their intent maybe. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4515.88s)]
*  You know, I don't have an answer for that. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4518.12s)]
*  It's mysterious, right? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4519.84s)]
*  Those points aren't like super classified, but like there's no logical reason for that, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4523.2s)]
*  you know, an object like that to know where they're going in the future. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4528.76s)]
*  Is there any other instances of something exhibiting that kind of speed that you're [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4532.76s)]
*  aware of? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4539.4s)]
*  I hear lots of stories about that from other aviators. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4541.72s)]
*  I haven't personally like witnessed the gunshot acceleration that you hear about. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4544.32s)]
*  What have you heard from other aviators? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4549.16s)]
*  You know, one of them was up by the Pax River, the test pilot area I mentioned. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4552.08s)]
*  A friend of mine that was on the East Coast with me who deployed and was used to seeing [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4556.88s)]
*  these objects was then in test pilot school and then stayed there as a test pilot, was [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4561.16s)]
*  out doing a mission, you know, off the Eastern Seaboard. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4565.88s)]
*  He had an object come up about 20 feet from his cockpit, looked similar to what's been [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4571.6s)]
*  described off the East Coast, was there for four to five, six seconds. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4576.24s)]
*  He's cruising at 350 knots, you know, somewhere in the teens, the thousands, you know, 15, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4579.64s)]
*  16, 17,000 feet. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4584.92s)]
*  An object just stays there for a handful of seconds and then just like darts off like [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4585.92s)]
*  into the great beyond, you know, very quickly. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4591.68s)]
*  And he's being monitored by a whole testing apparatus, right? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4595.4800000000005s)]
*  He's like mini NASA with all the screens and the test engineers because he's doing a real [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4599.160000000001s)]
*  flight test. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4601.92s)]
*  They knocked it off, you know, the ATC, the air traffic control, didn't have any knowledge [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4603.88s)]
*  of that air traffic and, you know, the test people didn't see it either. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4608.52s)]
*  But he ended up reporting that through the UAP Task Force report. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4612.360000000001s)]
*  He did end up getting debriefed and was likely one of the 144 reports. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4616.400000000001s)]
*  So I tell that to show that, you know, at least at the time it was working, right? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4621.68s)]
*  Like there was a real process. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4624.820000000001s)]
*  We know that now because we've seen the evidence of it in the reports. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4627.32s)]
*  But there's, you know, there's other cases of pilots where they just, you know, they [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4629.48s)]
*  see something in the distance and it's there, it's moving around in ways it can't explain [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4633.5199999999995s)]
*  and as they get closer, just, you know, shooting off like a cannon. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4636.879999999999s)]
*  When I was telling you earlier about the UAP off the eastern coast, that's kind of like [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4640.799999999999s)]
*  the new generation, but all the, you know, the aged aviators and the Navy, you know, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4644.96s)]
*  they all had their own stories, you know, whether it was... [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4649.879999999999s)]
*  All of them. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4652.44s)]
*  Not 100%, but you know, at least the ones that, you know, there are plenty that we're [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4653.44s)]
*  willing to talk about. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4656.719999999999s)]
*  I'll say about that, you know, I can't say how many weren't, but... [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4657.719999999999s)]
*  So this is not a rare occurrence. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4661.28s)]
*  It was a common... [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4662.799999999999s)]
*  It was happening for a long time, yeah. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4663.799999999999s)]
*  And this one that you were just describing, where it was very close to the cockpit and [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4665.299999999999s)]
*  then took off, was it the same thing, the translucent circle with this square inside [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4669.04s)]
*  of it? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4674.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4675.16s)]
*  What's the earliest known sightings of that particular type of object? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4676.16s)]
*  So far as I know, it's that late 2013, early 2014, back when we saw with the radar upgrade. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4681.24s)]
*  Have you seen anything visually? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4688.16s)]
*  I haven't been able to see it. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4690.0s)]
*  So we would fly up to it, people in our squadron would... [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4691.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, once of course we knew there was something there, we'd try to fly up to it, right, and [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4694.16s)]
*  see it. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4697.4s)]
*  And, you know, our safety limit is 500 feet, which is very close for us. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4698.4s)]
*  And we train all the time to come to what is called a merge, where we fly right by another [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4703.48s)]
*  aircraft really close, 500 feet is our safety bubble, and then we execute a fight, you know. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4708.6s)]
*  And we're trained to look at their wings, right, and see if they're... [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4714.28s)]
*  They have condensation clouding in the air above their wings to tell if they're pulling [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4717.12s)]
*  a lot of G, right, or if their flaps are auto scheduling down, right, to say they're low [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4721.2s)]
*  energy. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4725.8s)]
*  And so even though we're going by at 1,200 essentially miles per hour relative velocity, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4726.8s)]
*  it's really only a frame or two of information, we can make a pretty decent assessment of [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4734.04s)]
*  that other fighter and what they're going to do and their weapon loadouts and everything, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4738.240000000001s)]
*  right? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4742.64s)]
*  So we have these tools to tell us where to look. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4743.64s)]
*  So we're not just out there kind of gazing around. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4745.64s)]
*  All our sensors are pumped into our visor. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4747.740000000001s)]
*  And so as we look around, it shows us the object we have selected in a box, where to [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4749.8s)]
*  look right on our visor, no matter where we look. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4753.400000000001s)]
*  So as we come to this merge, we have every expectation of having a successful merge and [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4756.12s)]
*  seeing this object, right? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4760.64s)]
*  And then, you know, it wasn't there. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4761.92s)]
*  We'd still see it on the FLIR, right? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4765.96s)]
*  We still see the energy emitting from that area, but nothing visually. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4768.04s)]
*  So would have, wow. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4773.04s)]
*  So do you think that it's some of these things are not visually available? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4774.92s)]
*  I wish we just don't have enough data, right? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4779.96s)]
*  Like are they moving a little bit out of the way? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4783.24s)]
*  It's tough because again, we can only go so slow, even if we're like all the way back [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4785.04s)]
*  at like maybe 130 knots, right? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4788.72s)]
*  Still 150 miles an hour. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4790.84s)]
*  If that thing like was right in front of us and dropped down, I mean, I'd like to think [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4793.08s)]
*  that we'd still see it, but it's just, you know, it's just not the right tool to be doing [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4796.92s)]
*  that type of analysis. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4801.58s)]
*  You know, I mean, we just couldn't see it. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4802.58s)]
*  So does it mean that somehow they were deceiving us? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4804.3s)]
*  Or does it mean that not all of them were physical objects? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4806.4400000000005s)]
*  We just don't have enough data to say that. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4809.240000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, obviously, this is speculation. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4811.72s)]
*  But if you guys are using this equipment out there overseas, are you flying or there are [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4814.72s)]
*  many people that are flying these types of aircrafts using this type of equipment over [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4822.88s)]
*  the continental United States? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4828.88s)]
*  In the jet, you mean? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4832.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4833.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4834.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4835.360000000001s)]
*  Do they detect them there? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4836.360000000001s)]
*  Initially, we weren't reporting them over the continental United States. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4837.360000000001s)]
*  However, I have heard that, you know, essentially anywhere in F-18, you know, that has these [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4839.96s)]
*  radar capabilities, you know, seems to be testing them. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4845.2s)]
*  So we have them further inland and places like that. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4847.4400000000005s)]
*  And so far as I know, they've been experiencing them as well inland. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4849.6s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4853.52s)]
*  So is it possible that these things have some sort of a cloaking mechanism or they're not [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4854.66s)]
*  visually available to like, we can't see them because of the way their propulsion system [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4860.84s)]
*  works or whatever? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4866.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a lot of different ways, you know, that you could be visually deceitful. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4867.92s)]
*  Right? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4873.76s)]
*  Like you can, it doesn't have to be like a visibility cloak per se. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4874.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4877.6s)]
*  But like, I can think of like a lot of like tricky mechanisms that may make it very difficult [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4878.6s)]
*  to see something coming to emerge. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4881.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4883.32s)]
*  Even if it's just like, you know, something that can change polarity with electrical charge [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4884.32s)]
*  and like, you know, it makes it lighter or darker object or something. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4890.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4892.400000000001s)]
*  Like those windows. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4893.400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's a physical object until you change polarity. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4894.400000000001s)]
*  Now you can see through the, you know, the object in a sense. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4896.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4899.16s)]
*  So there's trickery there, you know, that could be done and all the way from kind of [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4900.16s)]
*  basic trickery to advanced, you know, invisibility science and physics with negative diffraction [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4904.76s)]
*  and things of that nature. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4910.719999999999s)]
*  But we just don't know. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4911.96s)]
*  We just don't know. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4914.16s)]
*  How much has this changed the way you view our place on Earth in the universe? [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4915.88s)]
*  You know, it certainly opened me up to all the assumptions that I think I had baked in [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4923.24s)]
*  from birth in a sense. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4928.8s)]
*  And as I grew up that were kind of either baked into me or put into me or, you know, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4930.44s)]
*  I put into myself that, you know, basically said anything outside of this median channel [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4935.679999999999s)]
*  here is rubbish. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4940.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4941.88s)]
*  In some sense, kind of I was middle of the road, I guess you could say. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4942.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4947.92s)]
*  But this really kind of made me realize that, you know, our place in the universe and in [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4949.92s)]
*  the cosmos and even here on Earth just might not be as apparent as we think it is. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4954.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4962.52s)]
*  Like we, and that doesn't sound very exciting, but like we come in a place of confidence. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4963.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4966.52s)]
*  We have this perception that, you know, we're the masters of the universe. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4967.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4970.64s)]
*  We haven't seen anything else out there. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4971.64s)]
*  We imagine that there's other stuff, but we have no evidence of it. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4972.64s)]
*  And in a sense, you know, we are the best thing that has ever been in the universe. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4975.52s)]
*  So to think that there's a lot of other stuff out there. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4980.4400000000005s)]
*  For me personally, it's really, I'd say, allowed me to better explore that kind of non-traditional [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4984.320000000001s)]
*  mainstream thoughts in a sense. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4994.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4998.280000000001s)]
*  You know, UAP wasn't something I grew up thinking about, but after I kind of got over the skepticism [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=4999.280000000001s)]
*  and looked at it and, you know, just realized how much information was there, it made me [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5004.32s)]
*  wonder what else, you know, I haven't been paying attention to. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5009.799999999999s)]
*  Or what other small assumptions, even if it's not something as exotic as UAP, but what other [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5012.44s)]
*  scientific assumptions have we made or, you know, economic or sociological scientific [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5018.12s)]
*  assumptions that we've made that just kind of pushed us in the wrong direction, but it's [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5024.44s)]
*  right enough that it hasn't caused too much of a problem yet. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5027.84s)]
*  Have you entertained the possibility that there are things that are native to Earth [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5032.6s)]
*  that are highly intelligent that we're not aware of? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5037.92s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I've gone down that rabbit hole a little bit and I'm not shy of going [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5040.92s)]
*  down these rabbit holes and exploring them, you know. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5045.8s)]
*  So like, I have the ultra-terrestrial type theory and, you know, I know you probably [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5047.6s)]
*  know more than I do, but I've heard those theories. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5052.52s)]
*  Can I ask you, what time frame do you think that that ultra-terrestrial theory would come [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5057.96s)]
*  from? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5062.88s)]
*  Do you think that's like something that arose on Earth a long time ago or something that's [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5063.88s)]
*  more recent? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5066.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a great question. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5067.4800000000005s)]
*  Because why would it avoid detection? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5069.28s)]
*  Like, what's the reason for it? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5070.76s)]
*  Why would it always have avoided detection? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5073.64s)]
*  There's not like a historical record of these things like coming out of the ocean and flying [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5075.96s)]
*  around from a thousand years ago that we're aware of. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5081.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5084.36s)]
*  How would it evolve? [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5085.52s)]
*  What is it doing? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5088.72s)]
*  How come we're not detecting them with submarines? [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5090.28s)]
*  How come we're not detecting them when we fly over the ocean on a regular basis? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5092.64s)]
*  If this thing is avoiding detection, why is it doing that? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5097.8s)]
*  Is it observing us? [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5102.76s)]
*  Is this, you know, you want to go really far out? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5104.96s)]
*  Is this what made us? [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5108.36s)]
*  You know, like, what are we? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5110.16s)]
*  We are so different from every other life form on Earth in the fact that we wear clothes [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5112.2s)]
*  and the fact that we can communicate and the fact that we are obsessed with technological [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5118.72s)]
*  innovation. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5124.32s)]
*  It seems to be the number one thing that human beings physically make. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5125.32s)]
*  If you looked at us collectively, you have all these people that are working constantly. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5129.8s)]
*  And what's the treat? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5135.16s)]
*  What's the care at the end of the stick? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5136.16s)]
*  New or better stuff. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5138.28s)]
*  Whether it's a new or better car, a new or better TV, or a new or better phone. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5139.76s)]
*  One of the main reasons why people work as hard as they do, they're incentivized by technological [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5144.88s)]
*  innovation. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5152.2s)]
*  They're incentivized by, like, if we just looked at us, if you just abandoned the idea [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5153.400000000001s)]
*  of culture and context and what are these weird talking monkeys doing? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5157.16s)]
*  Well, they're making better stuff constantly. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5162.04s)]
*  Well, why are they doing that? [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5164.12s)]
*  It seems like that is what they're obsessed with, just like a bee is making a beehive. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5167.16s)]
*  Do they know why they're doing it? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5171.32s)]
*  Do they know why collectively they group up in these cities with millions and millions [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5173.16s)]
*  of people and if you watch the cars come in and out at night, it's much like blood in [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5178.48s)]
*  an artery. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5183.919999999999s)]
*  You know, in an artery. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5184.919999999999s)]
*  You're watching things moving back and forth and backing forth and they're creating objects, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5186.08s)]
*  better and better objects. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5192.2s)]
*  And they don't seem to be collectively aware of what they're doing and they distract themselves [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5193.24s)]
*  with these cultural issues and all these, you know, you have two completely different [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5199.5199999999995s)]
*  polarizing political parties that are constantly at odds and fighting against each other and [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5204.599999999999s)]
*  all the while they're creating artificial intelligence. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5210.16s)]
*  And all the while they're creating some sort of a symbiotic relationship with intelligent [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5214.04s)]
*  computing and with artificial intelligence and with technology that seems to be going [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5221.36s)]
*  in a way where they're going to integrate with it. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5227.5599999999995s)]
*  They're going to physically integrate with these electronic devices and with technology [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5229.96s)]
*  and with the Internet. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5235.719999999999s)]
*  Like, why? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5236.719999999999s)]
*  Why is it doing that? [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5237.719999999999s)]
*  Why is it not aware of that? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5238.719999999999s)]
*  That should be like the number one thing, other than climate change and super volcanoes [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5240.599999999999s)]
*  and giant threats to civilization. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5246.8s)]
*  They should be really concerned with the direction the shit is going. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5249.64s)]
*  But they seem to be blissfully unaware, foot on the gas, all gas, no brakes, moving in [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5253.2s)]
*  that general direction. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5259.56s)]
*  Like what if that's what we do? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5261.4400000000005s)]
*  What if that's what this species does? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5264.92s)]

*  to a new life form? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5272.72s)]

*  to be completely unhindered by all of these problems that we have? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5326.2s)]

*  of environmental hazards and all of these problems that we've created for ourselves, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5341.5199999999995s)]
*  why we've pushed all gas, no brakes, towards this industrial revolution and this technological [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5346.16s)]

*  I think in an ideal world that would probably be switched around, right? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5442.4800000000005s)]
*  Our culture would define what we need and what we define as important and then we would [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5445.160000000001s)]
*  build tools that would help enable those things that we think are important. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5449.6s)]
*  I would even say that perhaps it's even a bit further down. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5455.320000000001s)]
*  When you think about an artificial intelligence, which really at the end of the day is electromagnetic [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5459.0s)]
*  energy in a sense. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5464.16s)]
*  So if we were to truly merge with an AI outside of being rid of all our things that ail us [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5465.16s)]
*  and our physical bodies, really it might be a move away from just generally space-time [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5471.8s)]
*  itself, which we're learning is less fundamental than we already thought. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5476.8s)]
*  If there is a coherent artificial intelligence contained with a pocket of electromagnetic [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5481.639999999999s)]

*  bring to us. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5501.400000000001s)]

*  We conceivably would have the power to control all the processes that we observe in the known [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5521.160000000001s)]
*  universe. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5527.88s)]
*  Black holes, the birth and death of stars, all that stuff. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5528.88s)]
*  If you think of what we can do now based on what amoebas can do, and you take that a million [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5536.0s)]
*  years in the future, and as long as we don't blow ourselves up, as long as we don't get [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5542.96s)]
*  hit by an asteroid, you keep going and you have more and more control over the physical [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5548.26s)]
*  nature of the universe and of technology and power, and we can harness dark energy and [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5556.26s)]
*  who the fuck knows what the future is? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5561.24s)]
*  And maybe what we're seeing is creatures or some things that have already made these leaps [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5564.64s)]
*  or some version of these leaps. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5573.200000000001s)]
*  Maybe they're the British explorers that land on the coast and check out the natives. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5576.200000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's what they are. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5584.12s)]
*  And maybe they're primitive in terms of what their capabilities are in comparison to what [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5585.3s)]
*  is possible with a million more years of evolution. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5594.6s)]

*  Our technological innovation and our lust for constant improvement of our ability to [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5604.280000000001s)]
*  change the world, it's not going to stop. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5609.92s)]
*  It's going to keep moving. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5612.0s)]
*  So where does it go? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5613.64s)]
*  I think it's Professor Hanson who's an economist. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5616.76s)]
*  And what he calls that is a greedy society where we just want to keep taking and keep [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5620.94s)]
*  building and keep growing. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5626.339999999999s)]
*  And one of the great mysteries, of course, is why don't we see alien life out there? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5628.219999999999s)]
*  Because we're greedy, we expand, and we assume that anything else out there would also want [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5632.82s)]
*  to expand to gain more resources or to explore. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5639.339999999999s)]
*  We like to go to different places to explore. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5642.98s)]
*  Is that a pure economic driven thing or is it something about our human nature that we [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5646.38s)]
*  like to discover new things? [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5651.26s)]
*  And his big thought is we don't see anything out there. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5655.66s)]
*  And because we don't, and if we assume that we don't see anything out there and we assume [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5659.58s)]
*  that essentially the UAP do represent other life forms, then the assumption is that they [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5664.66s)]
*  found a way to make themselves not greedy. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5671.74s)]
*  So they stop themselves from expanding in a sense. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5674.6s)]
*  To control that weird rogue unit from just expanding in a million years or however long [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5678.200000000001s)]
*  it takes for that seed of a civilization that might go out in a spaceship to come back and [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5683.34s)]
*  be the greedy thing that takes up the whole universe. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5689.4400000000005s)]
*  Well the way to do that is to eliminate sexual reproduction. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5692.64s)]
*  That would be one of the big ways. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5697.4400000000005s)]
*  Because one of the reasons why people are greedy. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5699.4800000000005s)]
*  Especially males are greedy because they want to be the alpha. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5702.48s)]
*  They want to acquire the most resources so they have the pick of the litter so they can [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5706.88s)]
*  decide what gets done. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5713.08s)]
*  They have the most power over the other entities, the other humans. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5715.04s)]
*  If that gets eliminated, if we merge with artificial intelligence or we become some [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5719.219999999999s)]
*  sort of new version of artificial intelligence. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5726.78s)]
*  The way I've described it in the past is that we are the electronic caterpillar that becomes [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5729.42s)]
*  the butterfly and we don't even know what we're doing. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5734.82s)]
*  We're just in the middle of making this cocoon. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5737.42s)]
*  We just got to make the cocoon. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5739.84s)]
*  We're busy making the cocoon. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5741.22s)]
*  I need an iPhone 14, making the cocoon. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5742.22s)]
*  I need a new Tesla, making the cocoon. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5744.66s)]
*  All that innovation, it all leads to exponentially more powerful innovation, exponentially more [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5748.3s)]
*  powerful technology. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5755.22s)]
*  Ultimately, the end game is artificial life and the ability to transcend space and time [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5757.02s)]
*  and just unimaginable technological power. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5765.38s)]
*  I don't think that's possible unless we get rid of emotions, sexual desire, lust, greed, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5770.580000000001s)]
*  all those things, which are human things. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5777.580000000001s)]
*  Those are the things that allowed us to survive when we're running away from big cats. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5780.18s)]
*  We're trying to stay alive from predators. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5787.0s)]
*  That very desire to stay alive and to breed and to fight off conquering tribes, that's [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5790.24s)]
*  allowed us to innovate and create technology because that's the thing that separate us [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5799.16s)]
*  from the other animals is our ability to develop tools and our ability to innovate and to think [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5803.36s)]
*  and plan out how to protect ourselves, how to accumulate resources so that we can be [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5811.2s)]
*  safe and how to develop walls and cities and urbanization and all these different things [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5817.16s)]
*  have essentially set the stage for this innovation to become a part of us. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5823.24s)]
*  The only way to separate ourselves from all of the pitfalls, all the things that hold [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5828.6s)]
*  us back, which are the emotions, the anger, the greed, all the things that we find distasteful [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5834.04s)]
*  about humans, a lot of it is tied to sexual reproduction. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5842.6s)]
*  A lot of it is tied to our biological needs. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5846.76s)]
*  If we can get past that, that's what those fucking alien things are. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5851.76s)]
*  If you look at the archetypal alien, they have no muscle. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5857.72s)]
*  They're these thin things with these giant heads. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5861.8s)]
*  They have no genitals. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5864.4400000000005s)]
*  What if what we're seeing, maybe it's not even physically a representation of an actual [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5866.400000000001s)]
*  thing that we're seeing. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5875.96s)]
*  Maybe what we're seeing is we're recognizing the pattern, that this is where it goes, that [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5877.6s)]
*  this is where the upright human animal, the hominid, this is what it becomes. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5882.84s)]
*  You just keep going and it merges with technology and then it becomes that thing. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5889.160000000001s)]
*  I take a little bit different view on the anatomy side of it, but I think of it more [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5894.6s)]
*  of maybe that's the best tool they have to interact with us at a peer level, is to build [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5899.92s)]
*  something that somewhat looks like us, but is different enough so that it doesn't get [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5905.5s)]
*  mistaken as, it's not sneaky in a sense. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5909.88s)]
*  They don't want to be sneaky, they want to be apparent. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5912.64s)]
*  Maybe that's the tool they use in a sense. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5915.4400000000005s)]
*  It's not a being made of light that we don't even recognize as a life form. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5917.6s)]
*  Yeah, if I was waving to an ant, it's not going to know what's going on. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5920.8s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5925.04s)]
*  Well, that could be possible too. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5926.04s)]
*  It could be that those things are drones, that those things are artificial, intelligent [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5927.6s)]
*  creatures, and that the actual intelligence that created them is disembodied in the future. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5932.0s)]
*  We just talked about, yeah, space time being one of the things that drops out if we do [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5938.320000000001s)]
*  merge with AI potentially. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5944.280000000001s)]
*  That would make sense that if they were outside of space time, they would need to construct [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5946.96s)]
*  something of space time in order to interact here. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5949.96s)]
*  Brian, well, if this Bob Lazar story about element 115 is real, and they can apply this [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5952.92s)]
*  at scale, like if you have enough element 115 in a reactor that's sophisticated enough, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5960.26s)]
*  you can travel to anywhere in the universe instantaneously. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5966.2s)]
*  There's no boundaries, no physical boundaries in terms of what's possible. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5970.76s)]
*  I also want to believe that. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5976.16s)]
*  I want to believe all of it. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5977.36s)]

*  I want to believe all of it, but I also know that there's certain elements of what we're [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5980.5599999999995s)]
*  discussing that are 100% in process of happening, like Elon Musk's Neuralink. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5983.32s)]

*  Like what the fuck is that? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5993.84s)]
*  Like where's that coming? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5996.12s)]
*  I mean, you know, he's not talking about next week, but he's talking about ultimately and [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=5997.12s)]
*  eventually. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6000.44s)]
*  And I feel like that's where all this stuff is going to go. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6001.88s)]
*  It's not going to get less sophisticated. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6005.56s)]
*  You know, I was having this conversation with my kids last night. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6007.4800000000005s)]
*  I was saying, we're having this talk about new phones because I have an iPhone 14. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6010.64s)]
*  They're like, is it better? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6016.4400000000005s)]
*  And I'm like, no. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6017.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, yes, but not in any noticeable way that I recognize every day. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6018.4400000000005s)]
*  The camera with the 13 was great, too. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6023.52s)]
*  It's silly. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6025.6s)]
*  And I'm like, what's funny about people is that we never are happy. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6026.6s)]
*  If we just decided, this was the conversation we were having, I said if we just decided [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6030.700000000001s)]
*  right now to stop making new things, we would have a pretty great life if we decided, OK, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6034.5599999999995s)]
*  planes are fast enough. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6041.0s)]

*  Phones are great. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6044.259999999999s)]
*  You can talk. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6045.259999999999s)]

*  You can see each other. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6050.24s)]
*  We don't need to fix that. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6051.44s)]
*  Just maintain it. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6052.58s)]
*  Let's just the Tesla. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6054.16s)]
*  Jesus, so fast. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6055.16s)]
*  Listen, we don't need a new car. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6056.16s)]

*  We're never going to do that. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6063.32s)]
*  We're never going to do it. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6065.16s)]
*  We would self-destruct. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6066.16s)]
*  Like there's just no way we could do it. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6067.16s)]
*  Why? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6068.96s)]
*  Why, though? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6069.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6070.96s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6071.96s)]
*  Humans, beings need to reproduce. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6072.96s)]
*  That's a lot of it. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6075.4s)]
*  A lot of it is the desire to accumulate resources and power. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6076.4s)]
*  And a lot of that is tied to these biological urges that are baked into us from the time [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6081.84s)]
*  that we really did have to survive from animals trying to eat us. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6088.0599999999995s)]
*  I saw a video today of this poor fucking guy who was rock climbing and a bear tried to [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6093.5599999999995s)]
*  attack him. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6098.919999999999s)]
*  I was like, that used to be us all the time. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6099.919999999999s)]
*  That was us on a daily basis. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6102.879999999999s)]
*  Have you seen that, Jamie? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6104.28s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6106.28s)]
*  Did he climb? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6107.28s)]
*  The guy's got like a GoPro on and he's climbing up this rock and a bear comes down at him [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6108.28s)]
*  and tries to get him. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6115.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6116.639999999999s)]
*  That's even worse. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6117.639999999999s)]
*  And so he swats it to the side. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6118.639999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6120.04s)]
*  So this guy's climbing up. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6121.04s)]
*  And look at this. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6122.64s)]
*  This bear comes right out and he pushes it and it runs back up at him and he kicks at [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6123.64s)]
*  him. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6129.04s)]
*  So one interesting thing about bears is grizzly bears generally when they attack people, they're [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6131.96s)]
*  attacking people because you surprise them and it's a female with cubs. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6138.06s)]
*  But black bears are often attacking people for food. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6143.0s)]
*  They're predatory in the sense that they recognize that people are weak and they're [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6147.36s)]
*  like, oh, I'll just eat that thing. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6152.44s)]
*  Because they cannibalize each other on a regular basis. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6153.96s)]
*  So anything that they can eat. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6157.5199999999995s)]
*  Black bears, one of my friends was up in Alberta and he observed a male black bear attack a [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6159.36s)]
*  female in their cubs, kill one of the cubs. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6168.32s)]
*  The female scared the male off and then the female ate her own cub. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6171.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh damn. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6176.72s)]
*  I didn't see that coming. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6177.72s)]
*  Hard world. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6179.320000000001s)]
*  The dead one or the live one? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6180.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the dead one. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6181.320000000001s)]
*  The dead one that the male had killed. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6182.320000000001s)]
*  Once it was dead, she's like, well, might as well eat it. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6183.92s)]
*  Might as well eat my baby. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6187.12s)]
*  Hallease. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6188.12s)]
*  She's ate it right there in front of him. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6189.12s)]
*  And he's like, Jesus Christ. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6190.12s)]
*  That's what a bear is. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6193.400000000001s)]
*  It's not a stuffed animal that sits next to your kid at night when it goes to bed. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6194.56s)]
*  It's not Yogi. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6198.56s)]
*  That's what a bear is. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6200.0s)]
*  It's not Winnie the Pooh. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6201.0s)]
*  That thing trying to eat that climber. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6202.7s)]
*  That's a bear. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6205.4400000000005s)]
*  Here we are, strip mining our planet and killing stuff. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6207.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6210.599999999999s)]
*  It's not too different, I suppose. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6211.599999999999s)]
*  We're not innocent. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6212.599999999999s)]
*  We're certainly not innocent. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6213.599999999999s)]
*  But my point is that I think that we have all these instincts because we are a part of [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6214.879999999999s)]
*  the natural world. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6220.32s)]
*  And the only way we can transcend that is to eliminate all of those biological urges. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6221.879999999999s)]
*  If we have true mastery over the material world and to the point where we no longer [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6227.4s)]
*  need to be hindered by those biological urges, that seems to me like the best way to transcend [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6233.92s)]
*  space and time. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6242.2s)]
*  Like the best way to eliminate all the things that kind of hold us back when it comes to [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6243.2s)]
*  logical, rational thinking. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6248.64s)]
*  A lot of it is emotional. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6250.36s)]
*  And I think that that may be the future of the intelligent species in the universe. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6252.36s)]
*  They probably don't act like barbarians. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6259.54s)]
*  They probably have transcended that. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6264.58s)]
*  And they've recognized that all the problems that we have... [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6266.58s)]
*  Like what's the number one problem we have in the world? [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6269.58s)]
*  It's probably war. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6271.58s)]
*  Other than the environment and what we're doing to the environment, it's probably war. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6273.18s)]
*  It's the most horrific, terrifying thing. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6276.94s)]
*  That human beings will attack other groups of human beings they don't even know and try [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6279.62s)]
*  to steal their resources, which is generally what they're trying to do when they're... [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6283.66s)]
*  They don't go to war for no reason. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6288.74s)]
*  They're generally going to war for there's a benefit there. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6291.099999999999s)]
*  Well, if we could get past that, boy, if there was no war, imagine the cooperation that we [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6294.86s)]
*  could have. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6301.62s)]
*  Imagine how much we could get done. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6302.62s)]
*  If we all spoke the same language, we all treated each other as if we were the same [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6304.26s)]
*  thing living other lives, and we all just shared resources and worked together to make [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6308.46s)]
*  life better for the species. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6315.179999999999s)]
*  Well, how would you do that? [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6317.54s)]
*  Well, you'd have to eliminate the lust and greed. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6318.54s)]
*  What's the best way to eliminate the lust and greed? [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6321.58s)]
*  Well, to become something different and more advanced. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6323.22s)]
*  And the best way to do that is to no longer have all these urges that human beings have, [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6326.18s)]
*  the urge to be powerful and to dominate and all of our dominator culture stuff that's [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6331.78s)]
*  just a natural part of being a primate. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6337.82s)]
*  So what do we lose with that? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6340.14s)]
*  Everything. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6342.14s)]
*  We lose music and comedy and fun and romance. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6343.14s)]
*  We lose the best first date of your life where you lose everything. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6347.900000000001s)]
*  You lose drinking wine and laughing with friends. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6353.5s)]
*  You're going to lose everything. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6355.780000000001s)]
*  You're going to lose all the things that we love about being the imperfect creatures that [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6356.780000000001s)]
*  we are today. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6361.18s)]
*  But what you gain is you become these super powerful, ultra enlightened beings that have [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6362.3s)]
*  different motivation. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6370.820000000001s)]
*  And I think that that's probably going to occur, it's going to probably occur in stages. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6373.82s)]
*  And one of the stages is probably going to be either virtual reality or augmented reality [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6379.339999999999s)]
*  that can provide you with experiences that are far superior to the physical ones that [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6385.219999999999s)]
*  you have to get on your own. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6390.7s)]
*  I mean, I think we romanticize so many things about our life, like that guy climbing, right? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6392.099999999999s)]
*  That guy's climbing because he's trying to get this thrill of like trying to physically [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6400.06s)]
*  take yourself through a dangerous course up a mountain and you get this thrill that you're [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6408.38s)]
*  doing this because if you fall you're dead. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6414.02s)]
*  And along the way he almost gets fucking eaten, right? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6416.02s)]
*  Which is pretty wild. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6418.580000000001s)]
*  But we romanticize it. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6420.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's baked into us in a way that it's like inherent to our physical being. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6424.14s)]
*  Like whenever I go on trips into the woods, one of the things that shocks me is how good [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6430.58s)]
*  I feel. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6438.14s)]
*  Almost like it hits a frequency that I've been needing but that's not accessible to [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6439.78s)]
*  me living in a city. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6446.98s)]
*  And when I'm in the woods and when I'm climbing a mountain and I'm out there with nature, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6448.9s)]
*  when I'm out there I feel so good. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6454.5s)]
*  I feel so centered and grounded. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6456.7s)]
*  Like I feel better than I feel at any other time. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6459.3s)]
*  And it resets me in a way that's not available in a city. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6462.38s)]
*  But what if that's available through augmented reality or a virtual reality? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6466.5s)]
*  What if that's available through a chip that gets installed in your brain and it's far [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6470.62s)]
*  superior to that feeling that you get? [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6475.12s)]
*  And you recognize the futility of that experience. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6477.46s)]
*  What you're trying to do is you're trying to recreate what it was like when people lived [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6480.179999999999s)]
*  a thousand years ago or ten thousand years ago and you had to survive by throwing a spear [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6484.62s)]
*  at a rabbit or whatever. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6490.139999999999s)]
*  That was the only way you could feed your family. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6491.9s)]
*  You would look at that time at how difficult it was and imagine just being able to go to [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6495.219999999999s)]
*  a grocery store and going, oh my god that's so much better. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6500.139999999999s)]
*  Grocery store is so much better. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6503.179999999999s)]
*  Nobody wants to go back to hunting for food every day. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6504.179999999999s)]
*  It's too fucking hard. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6506.66s)]
*  But we don't think of it that way because we have the grocery store because it exists. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6509.22s)]
*  Well, what if there's something that's exponentially more significant than a grocery store? [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6513.38s)]
*  Like that life experiences itself. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6520.0199999999995s)]
*  All the things that you love about life. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6522.98s)]
*  All the things you love about romance and creation and culture and all the wonderful [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6525.86s)]
*  things that we think of when we associate the best aspects of human life and human interaction [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6533.34s)]
*  and human community. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6538.900000000001s)]
*  What if that pales in comparison to what can be created technologically? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6540.14s)]
*  We're going to embrace it just like we embrace phones. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6546.26s)]
*  We all have phones. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6550.58s)]
*  I remember the old days where I don't even have an email. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6551.820000000001s)]
*  There was a few holdouts. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6554.820000000001s)]
*  Those fucking people are all on board now. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6556.22s)]
*  It just took a decade. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6557.900000000001s)]
*  It took a little while. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6558.900000000001s)]
*  What if that's the future of this symbiotic interaction that we have with technology? [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6560.42s)]
*  I think it is. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6566.22s)]
*  I think that's where we're going. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6567.82s)]
*  My fascination with these UAPs and with this idea that we're being visited by these things, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6569.66s)]
*  I almost feel like they're cultivating us. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6577.78s)]
*  I almost feel like they're watching us, whatever they are. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6580.46s)]
*  They're just making sure we don't blow ourselves up along the process. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6584.14s)]
*  One of the things that has been discussed by many people that have experienced these [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6587.98s)]
*  things on military bases is their ability to shut down bases, their ability to shut [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6591.9s)]
*  down these nuclear facilities. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6597.58s)]
*  You got to think that if they were going to wonder about any one particular thing that [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6601.419999999999s)]
*  we have access to, it's being in this transitionary period between having these primate instincts [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6605.74s)]
*  applying them to spectacular technology in a brutish, horrific way, like we're worried [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6614.0599999999995s)]
*  about right now with Russia. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6621.38s)]
*  We're worried that Putin, because all the horrific things that are happening already [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6622.98s)]
*  in Ukraine, the bombings and the drone strikes and possibly the use of hypersonic missiles, [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6626.58s)]
*  what if that's applied to nuclear weapons? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6633.5s)]
*  What if we're dealing with a nuclear holocaust? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6635.86s)]
*  That's really what we're worried about. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6639.42s)]
*  I wonder if that's what they're monitoring. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6641.74s)]
*  You asked earlier about the why now part, but there's a lot of stuff happening. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6646.3s)]
*  There's climate, there's war, there's everything else. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6651.38s)]
*  It feels like we're accelerating towards something. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6654.38s)]
*  Technology not least of all moving us towards what some people call the singularity. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6657.62s)]
*  Maybe they're all here to watch the birth in a sense. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6664.38s)]
*  I think the hope would be that we would be part of that birth, as you described, to integrate [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6667.099999999999s)]
*  with the artificial intelligence. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6670.86s)]
*  I know that there's efforts to consider the moral and ethical application of artificial [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6672.94s)]
*  intelligence, but are we fooling ourselves? [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6680.219999999999s)]
*  Are we going to have the options of maintaining an ethical AI once it's been created? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6684.099999999999s)]
*  Is it possible to create safeguards in an AI that transition into the singularity and [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6689.66s)]
*  allow it to keep in mind human interest once it's already become sentient, if that can [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6696.86s)]
*  happen? [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6702.0199999999995s)]
*  One thing that you mentioned about artificial intelligence, if that is the output of our [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6705.62s)]
*  craving for advancement, what does that change for the world? [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6711.22s)]
*  There would only be one general artificial intelligence, I would assume, because anything [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6716.26s)]
*  that would be created afterwards, if it was not a secret, would be subsumed by the primary [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6720.26s)]
*  AI. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6724.82s)]
*  So this kind of ties into a thought I've had before about maybe the way we're interacting [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6726.5s)]
*  with UAP, or we're going to make the assumption that it's coming from another planet right [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6733.299999999999s)]
*  now. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6737.86s)]
*  And so with that assumption, perhaps as societies mature, much like you described, they do start [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6738.86s)]
*  to advance their sociological side. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6745.0199999999995s)]
*  They start to work better as a group. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6747.54s)]
*  They remove some of those more animalistic urges that they evolved with, and that remained [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6748.98s)]
*  when they got the power of the gods, if you will, once they had technology but were still [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6754.66s)]
*  commanded by their primal urges. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6759.58s)]
*  You may very well be right, there's that transitional period that we live in at this moment. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6763.38s)]
*  Maybe that adds to a lot of the hecticness of our current days. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6767.86s)]
*  But what if those other planets, since they have realized that, they interact with us [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6777.22s)]
*  as a planet, as an entity? [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6781.08s)]
*  If that's the way their society has evolved in a sense to be more collaborative and less [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6783.54s)]
*  argumentative, then they may approach us as a planet to planet versus a country to country, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6790.26s)]
*  or individual to individual. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6796.38s)]
*  They might assume that since the best things can only happen when the most people work [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6798.18s)]
*  together, in a sense, if we can assume that if you and I work together, Joe, we can do [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6803.42s)]
*  more than just if either of us worked alone. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6809.26s)]
*  If we make that assumption and apply that to a planet, it would make sense that if there [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6812.9s)]
*  are a bunch of species out there, that if they survived, they would have learned how [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6817.42s)]
*  to work together. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6821.02s)]
*  And they might assume that of us. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6823.26s)]
*  They're like, oh wow, look, they have all these cool tools, they must have moved to [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6824.5s)]
*  that point where they know how to work together. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6826.82s)]
*  Do you think that? [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6829.34s)]
*  I don't think they would think that. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6830.34s)]
*  I think they'd watch us and go, oh, look at these crazy fucks. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6831.62s)]
*  Well, that's why we're anomaly, because we do have these tools and yet we're not ready. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6834.34s)]
*  Maybe that's just how it normally is when a civilization or when civilization in general [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6839.46s)]
*  advances past a point where we're at now. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6846.02s)]
*  That there is this chaotic moment where there are sort of a combination of lower primate [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6849.94s)]
*  and higher being. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6856.54s)]
*  And the power of nuclear weapons, the power to send video through the sky, and it appears [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6858.46s)]
*  that you keep in your pocket that you literally talk to and it gives you answers to things. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6866.8s)]
*  I was having a conversation with my kids last night and they went to see Little Nas X and [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6871.6s)]
*  how great it was. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6875.68s)]
*  And I'm like, how old is that guy? [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6876.68s)]
*  How old is Little Nas X? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6878.88s)]
*  Bang, 23. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6880.12s)]
*  It just shows you on the phone. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6881.12s)]
*  I'm like, how wild is that? [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6882.12s)]
*  You could talk to a device. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6883.64s)]
*  That's fucking Jetson shit. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6885.4400000000005s)]
*  When I was a kid, that wasn't even in Star Trek. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6887.4400000000005s)]
*  Even in Star Trek, they had walkie talkies, remember? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6891.2s)]
*  It was like, Kurt out. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6893.72s)]
*  And you had to hang up a stupid phone. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=6895.64s)]

*  When I thought about flying a jet, it wasn't for passion of flying really. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7060.22s)]

*  I thought that was the place that I could really be at the tip of the spear as far as [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7067.4400000000005s)]
*  technology and how I could access it just as a regular guy with no experience or anything [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7071.96s)]
*  like that. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7077.8s)]
*  Frankly, I was driven by that same urge, just went about a different way. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7078.8s)]
*  That's one of the more fascinating things about classified military intelligence. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7083.24s)]
*  Because of the fact that it's military and because of the fact that there's a great benefit [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7088.6s)]
*  to the country for it being top secret and not being available to our enemies, we develop [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7092.76s)]

*  it's huge. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7110.88s)]
*  What is it? [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7112.400000000001s)]

*  Yeah, the Defense Department budget and we don't even know where all that stuff goes, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7117.24s)]
*  but it's trillions, trillions of dollars. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7122.2s)]
*  It's insane how much money it is. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7125.16s)]
*  It's going towards these technologies that we don't even know about until we see them [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7127.4400000000005s)]
*  implemented like the stealth bomber, for instance, is one of them, or the Manhattan Project, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7132.400000000001s)]
*  or many other things throughout history. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7137.72s)]
*  That's fascinating too because there's so much that's being ... When I see something [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7140.92s)]
*  these objects, these UAPs, part of me goes, how much of that shit is ours? [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7146.52s)]
*  How much of that shit is ours where they don't want to talk about it, they don't want to [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7152.04s)]
*  let us know, but they're implementing these technologies? [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7155.36s)]
*  Does Russia have something similar? [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7159.52s)]
*  Does China have something similar? [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7161.38s)]
*  How much of that shit is stuff that's just top secret drone technology? [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7163.4800000000005s)]
*  Because why is it all so near military basis? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7170.2s)]
*  That's one of the things that I thought almost immediately about the Tic Tac because that [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7173.48s)]
*  Tic Tac thing is real close to the ... It was real close to the Nimitz and it's real [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7177.5599999999995s)]
*  close to all the bases that are near San Diego. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7181.799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, what if that's ours? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7184.759999999999s)]
*  What if that's some super top secret, high level shit that we just don't ... We're not [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7187.12s)]
*  privy to that information. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7192.959999999999s)]
*  That's always ... I don't want to call it a risk, but I think we're inclined to think [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7195.919999999999s)]
*  like that too and we want to because again, we want to be true. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7200.5199999999995s)]
*  We want our government to be that smart and to have that information. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7203.96s)]
*  It makes us feel safer, I think. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7208.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7210.2s)]
*  I want it to be like a Captain America shield that flies at 10 times the speed of light. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7211.2s)]
*  Where does that end? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7218.96s)]
*  Let's just say that's true. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7219.96s)]
*  How much technology that could be beneficial for society via either energy production or [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7221.66s)]
*  Ways we can't even imagine because it was designed for a particular use case, but whenever [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7228.0199999999995s)]
*  something gets out and it's exposed to that innovation ecosystem, there's a flourishing. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7232.58s)]
*  People use that technology and those ideas in ways that people never thought of before. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7239.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7243.42s)]
*  It's not like you hear of something hidden away or technology, but imagine if all that [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7244.42s)]
*  was just out in the open to be meddled upon by the quantity of minds we have nowadays [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7248.42s)]

*  The problem with that is war. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7256.9s)]
*  The problem is that we can't have that kind of technology available to our enemies because [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7258.82s)]
*  then they would use it on us. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7263.0599999999995s)]
*  That's the big fear. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7264.759999999999s)]
*  If we do have something that's super powerful and just beyond imagination at this point [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7265.759999999999s)]

*  they use it on us before we could use it on that. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7280.42s)]
*  We want to have the technological military superiority because we think of ourselves [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7283.06s)]
*  as best case scenario of human beings on planet Earth in 2022. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7287.46s)]

*  Yeah, that's possible too. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7299.18s)]
*  Why are we talking about it more then? [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7300.9800000000005s)]
*  Because I assume that would still hold true unless there's been work elsewhere that has [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7302.42s)]
*  pushed up, made that less relevant. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7306.02s)]

*  Is there any discussion at all about UAPs over there? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7324.62s)]
*  There's a lot in Russia. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7327.9s)]
*  I mean, Russia has a history of UAP just like we do in the United States from my amateur [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7328.9s)]
*  research. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7334.34s)]
*  But in China too has been taking notice. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7335.34s)]
*  I hear that they have been apparently working on artificial intelligence or machine learning [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7337.78s)]
*  solutions to better understand what these objects are. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7342.74s)]
*  They've been communicating that they've been seeing a large number of these objects and [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7347.26s)]
*  that the sightings have been increasing. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7350.22s)]
*  Everything that leaves China essentially comes out of state media. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7353.38s)]
*  So what are they communicating exactly? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7355.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7357.94s)]
*  But they have been looking into it. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7358.94s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that would be the thing that unites us. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7362.46s)]
*  Remember that Ronald Reagan speech? [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7365.58s)]
*  Was it from the United Nations? [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7367.34s)]
*  I learned about it, yeah. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7370.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a wild speech. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7371.22s)]
*  You've seen the speech, right? [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7373.54s)]
*  Would Russia help us or Soviet Union help us if we were attacked from out of space? [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7374.9s)]
*  Yeah, well imagine how quickly we would have banned our differences if we were faced with [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7378.18s)]
*  an alien threat from another world. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7381.42s)]
*  And then all the UFO people went bonkers like, oh my god, he knows something. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7383.62s)]
*  Ronnie's trying to tell us. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7388.9s)]
*  And that's, I think, if there was something that united us as a human race instead of [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7391.66s)]
*  thinking ourselves as these individual communities that live on patches of land, tribal attitudes, [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7398.74s)]
*  the one thing that would do that is something from another planet. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7407.099999999999s)]
*  Knock on wood. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7410.74s)]
*  We have seen mostly bipartisanship in the bills that have been passing in the Congress [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7412.099999999999s)]
*  and Senate regarding UAP activities in the United States. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7417.139999999999s)]
*  To that point, it seems to, what's been happening in Congress and the Senate has been very rational, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7420.78s)]
*  strong bipartisan work by both Senator Gillibrand and Senator Rubio. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7429.78s)]
*  They've been working together on this problem. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7437.219999999999s)]
*  So to your point, I hope that continues. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7438.58s)]
*  I hope that is the thing that can kind of get us over all the back and forth. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7442.0599999999995s)]
*  What are the big, I'm sure besides the Commander David Fravor situation and some of the other, [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7446.22s)]
*  what have you ever heard of that's a big instance, like something crazy along those lines that [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7455.86s)]
*  maybe people haven't heard of? [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7464.22s)]
*  I don't know what people haven't heard of, but some things, there was a flyover over [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7467.3s)]
*  the United States Capitol, it seems, at some point in the 50s, where a group of UAP were [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7472.54s)]
*  just kind of cruising over the White House and the state building. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7478.18s)]
*  You can find pictures of it out there, although it hasn't been- [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7483.38s)]
*  Pictures of it. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7485.98s)]
*  Well, it's like a formation of lights, essentially. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7486.98s)]
*  So what is it? [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7489.18s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7490.82s)]
*  But essentially, there you go. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7491.82s)]
*  Is that, what? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7492.82s)]
*  That's a drawing. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7493.82s)]
*  That's a drawing. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7494.82s)]
*  That looks terrible. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7495.82s)]
*  Oh, so that's the actual thing? [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7498.82s)]
*  Wow, UFO sightings, a peaceful union, or battlefield earth. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7501.38s)]
*  So is that a real photograph? [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7506.860000000001s)]
*  So it's from the 1950s? [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7508.58s)]
*  This is from the History Channel, so this could be like a recreation of it. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7509.58s)]
*  Oh, right, probably. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7512.58s)]
*  Could be. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7513.58s)]
*  So from the 1950s, and that's a- [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7514.58s)]
*  That's a drawing for the newspaper. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7517.42s)]
*  Yeah, saucers over Washington, D.C. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7520.1s)]
*  Harry S. Barnes, senior air route traffic controller for the Civil Aeronautics Administration, [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7523.42s)]
*  was in charge of the National Airport, Washington, D.C., A.R.T. Control Center the night of July [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7529.26s)]
*  19, 1952. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7534.66s)]
*  Briefly, he states in a newspaper article, our job is to constantly monitor the skies [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7536.7s)]
*  around the nation's capital with the electronic eye of radar. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7542.14s)]
*  Shortly after midnight on that date, seven P.I.P.'s- [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7546.3s)]
*  What is a PIPs? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7550.58s)]
*  Do you know what that is? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7551.58s)]
*  PIPs? [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7553.58s)]
*  Seven PIPs? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7554.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7555.58s)]
*  PIPs appeared suddenly on the control center scope. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7556.58s)]
*  Ed Nugent, Jim Copeland, and Jim Ritchie, all experienced radar controllers, checked [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7560.42s)]
*  the observations. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7566.7s)]
*  The airport control tower radar operator verified the same sighting. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7568.0199999999995s)]
*  They were over the restricted areas of Washington, including the White House and the Capitol. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7572.66s)]
*  Wow. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7579.0599999999995s)]
*  There was some concern then that these were Russian, right? [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7581.82s)]
*  Because this was during the Cold War. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7587.0199999999995s)]
*  This was post-World War II. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7588.58s)]
*  We had gotten some of the Nazi scientists and they went on to work for NASA through [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7590.82s)]
*  Operation Paperclip. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7595.78s)]
*  Then Russia had gotten some Nazi scientists as well. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7597.259999999999s)]
*  We were concerned with who's going to develop some sort of spaceship or who's going to get [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7601.179999999999s)]
*  to the moon first. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7607.0599999999995s)]
*  All that shit was going on around then, right? [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7608.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7610.82s)]
*  A few years, supposedly after Roswell, people always ask about, it's like, well, why haven't [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7611.82s)]
*  we seen them? [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7617.9s)]
*  Why haven't they landed on the White House law and all that? [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7618.9s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7620.86s)]
*  If you do look back, there are some interesting examples of large groups of objects flying [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7621.86s)]
*  over very important areas, clearly making themselves known. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7626.78s)]
*  My take on that is if we find an ant colony, do we make ourselves available to the queen [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7631.259999999999s)]
*  for a meeting? [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7636.34s)]
*  We don't give a fuck who thinks they're in charge. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7637.860000000001s)]
*  If they're that advanced, they can come here from another galaxy. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7642.02s)]
*  They probably don't give a shit about Biden. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7646.9400000000005s)]
*  Come on, that's so silly. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7649.54s)]
*  Oh, that's your king. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7651.42s)]
*  But we do. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7652.900000000001s)]
*  We care about them. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7653.900000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7654.900000000001s)]
*  If they wanted to influence most of our people, they might look to influencing the person [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7655.900000000001s)]
*  we all look to, in a sense. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7658.9400000000005s)]
*  Or defy the power of these institutions by hovering over the Pentagon and letting them [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7661.58s)]
*  know we control. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7668.22s)]
*  I'm the captain now. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7670.82s)]
*  Look at me. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7672.18s)]
*  This thing with the New York Times from 2017 and having these meetings with these high [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7679.18s)]
*  level officials that are concerned about these things. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7686.4s)]
*  Is this moving in a general direction of transparency, do you think? [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7691.4s)]
*  Do you think they're recognizing that this is something that has to be addressed and [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7695.96s)]
*  has to be, that people have to be informed about this because it's so prevalent? [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7700.16s)]
*  I do. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7704.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7705.639999999999s)]
*  So, I mean, that's what I'm seeing at this point. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7706.639999999999s)]
*  I've engaged people, the Hill, and they are taking this very seriously. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7709.0s)]
*  By extension, they have pushed that seriousness back to D&I, DOD, and the offices that have [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7715.0s)]
*  stood up within there, namely AERO right now, the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7722.4400000000005s)]
*  From my perspective, they have a charter to engage the community on this, of course, not [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7729.360000000001s)]
*  to put any national security at risk. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7737.68s)]
*  But that's kind of another conversation, the classification problem, because that's its [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7741.0s)]
*  own entity, right? [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7744.2s)]
*  People might think if someone in the proper place can just declassify whatever they want, [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7745.4s)]
*  it's kind of its own entity that everyone else kind of operates under. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7750.28s)]
*  So it's not quite that simple. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7753.24s)]
*  It's kind of two problems there. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7754.24s)]
*  But I have seen, it seems to be, real movement in the direction of engaging the public on [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7755.76s)]
*  this topic. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7764.4s)]
*  What do you think their motivation for doing that is? [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7765.4s)]
*  I can't say exactly, but when I have been pushing people to pay attention to this, it's [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7769.04s)]
*  very simple. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7775.32s)]
*  Again, for me, it's about people are still flying by these things and almost hitting [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7776.32s)]
*  them, right? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7779.16s)]
*  We can talk all day about the societal implications of what they are, but at the end of the day, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7780.16s)]
*  the people, the operators that are flying around out there have to not hit these things. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7784.8s)]
*  And so from that sense, it's hard, I think, for people to ignore that because they understand [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7789.04s)]
*  this is a serious safety risk and that as we kind of transition that new knowledge of [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7796.4s)]
*  the risk to the commercial markets and the general aviation communities, it's going to [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7802.639999999999s)]
*  probably stir a few feathers. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7807.48s)]
*  The commercial markets, I think, don't necessarily want to acknowledge this because they have [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7810.4s)]
*  zero safety plan. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7814.24s)]
*  They've been ignoring this for a while. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7815.24s)]
*  And they might have to answer some hard questions about why they are ignoring the potential [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7817.48s)]
*  for midair with hundreds of people on their aircraft. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7823.16s)]
*  Has there ever been an instance where there has been a midair collision or crash that [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7826.76s)]
*  happened because of trying to avoid one of these things? [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7833.0s)]
*  So that's actually a better question than what I thought you were going to ask because [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7838.68s)]
*  I thought that's a great thing. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7842.8s)]
*  If a pilot sees one of these objects, right, and they have zero training on it and have [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7844.5599999999995s)]
*  no idea what it is or what to do, they might maneuver that aircraft in a way that could [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7848.12s)]
*  cause the aircraft to depart or to hurt somebody. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7851.88s)]
*  And so the angle you just touched on, which is the kind of training and the policy side [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7855.0s)]
*  of it where because we're actively not teaching pilots to deal with this, they could do something [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7860.12s)]
*  dangerous when they do it. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7864.84s)]
*  I thought you were going to ask, have we ever seen an airplane crash because of midair with [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7866.56s)]
*  a UFO? [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7869.96s)]
*  And again, we don't know. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7870.96s)]
*  Of course, there's been plane crashes, but nothing's been proven or else we wouldn't [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7873.8s)]
*  be having this conversation. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7876.96s)]
*  But avoiding something would cause a real issue if you're flying 500 miles an hour and [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7879.400000000001s)]
*  you see something in front of you and have to make an abrupt maneuver that's unplanned. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7885.64s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7890.280000000001s)]
*  Or the pilot says, oh, that's just something on my windscreen because clearly UFOs don't [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7893.320000000001s)]
*  exist and then they barrel into something and it turns out to be a balloon and they [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7897.12s)]
*  lose an engine. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7900.2s)]
*  Right? [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7901.2s)]
*  There's all sorts of ways you can go wrong and never, like not talking about it is never [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7902.2s)]
*  the solution when it comes to aviation safety. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7905.280000000001s)]
*  But how many pilots, like when it comes to commercial air pilots, how many pilots report [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7908.92s)]
*  these sort of sightings? [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7914.84s)]
*  And do these reports get to the Pentagon? [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7916.56s)]
*  Do they get to the White House? [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7920.0s)]
*  How does that happen? [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7921.84s)]
*  From where? [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7922.84s)]
*  If someone's flying for American Airlines and they see a circle with a cube inside of [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7923.84s)]
*  it that's going the speed of sound, what happens? [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7927.92s)]
*  Most likely the pilot will call up the air traffic controller they're currently talking [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7934.04s)]
*  with and ask them if they see the object or if there's other air traffic there and [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7937.52s)]
*  the most likely answer from what I've heard is no, they don't see the object. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7943.320000000001s)]
*  And so that just kind of leaves the pilot there at that point. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7947.96s)]
*  There is something that essentially says within the FAA manuals, if you will, I don't know [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7952.160000000001s)]
*  the exact one, where it says, hey, if you think you've seen a UFO and actually uses [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7956.240000000001s)]
*  that terminology, then you have the option to report it to the FAA. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7962.92s)]
*  It doesn't even tell you in office, it's just kind of like if you feel the need to report [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7967.24s)]
*  it then that's something you can do. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7969.84s)]
*  So what that tells me is that this isn't the first time that there's been people poking [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7971.84s)]
*  around trying to report on it, but that was really the best they could do is just say, [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7976.36s)]
*  you know, hey, if you really feel like this is important then sure, you can fire a message [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7979.76s)]
*  off, right? [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7983.16s)]
*  And that's kind of it. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7984.16s)]
*  So there's no organization, there's no acknowledgement. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7985.16s)]
*  What's this, Jamie? [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7987.679999999999s)]
*  A commercial pilot that filmed something. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7988.679999999999s)]
*  He saw. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7992.08s)]
*  What is that thing you're seeing? [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7993.08s)]
*  It gets closer. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7994.44s)]
*  So he's zooming in and there's this like black dot, it's like a circle. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=7998.16s)]
*  It kind of looks, what does it look like? [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8002.48s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8007.16s)]
*  Is that a TIE fighter? [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8008.16s)]
*  That's a cube. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8009.92s)]
*  So this was over a media in Columbia and it got, the article I found said that this was [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8010.92s)]
*  like labeled as a UFO is all it was labeled as. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8017.0s)]
*  I'm trying to find the link I had. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8020.96s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8022.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like a cube. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8023.5599999999995s)]
*  Go back to that again. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8024.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, that looks like a square. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8026.04s)]
*  The air crew on this particular incident, if I remember correctly, had seen the object [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8033.2s)]
*  for some time before it came into the camera's field of view, right? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8036.96s)]
*  So what's likely happening here is that the air crew are flying past that object, right? [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8041.24s)]
*  So like, it's not the air, the object not flying down their nose, it's the aircraft [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8046.16s)]
*  flying. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8050.84s)]
*  So they're flying close to it. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8051.84s)]
*  So it might be a balloon or something that's just floating around? [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8053.16s)]
*  Not to say that, but generally speaking, I think their kind of story, if I remember correctly, [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8055.96s)]
*  is that they were seeing it for a while and it was like doing something that was like [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8060.64s)]
*  strange to them. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8064.68s)]
*  I don't know what, if it's moving or changing shape like you saw or what, but it was something [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8065.68s)]
*  that like completely drew their attention and, you know, pulling their phones out. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8069.320000000001s)]
*  Airline pilot's not supposed to use their phone inside the cockpit like that, right? [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8073.12s)]
*  So he's breaking the rules in order to take a video of that, which I applaud him for. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8076.84s)]
*  You know, this is exactly the type of thing that we talk about when we talk about needing [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8082.76s)]
*  procedures and things of that nature, right? [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8086.56s)]
*  He's breaking the rules in order to get data on this, right? [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8088.320000000001s)]
*  And that's obviously not conducive to, you know, a proper investigation of this topic. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8090.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8095.12s)]
*  There was another one that was recent that was being discussed online that was taken [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8096.12s)]
*  from a fighter jet. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8101.76s)]
*  I don't remember what model jet, where it was the same sort of a situation where someone [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8103.400000000001s)]
*  was taking a photo of some sort of a triangle-shaped object that was in the sky. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8107.72s)]
*  I'm not sure about that one. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8112.92s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8113.92s)]
*  Do you remember that, Jamie? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8114.92s)]
*  Yeah, I had two. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8115.92s)]
*  So there's one that shows that photo, like it's an artist's rendition of it. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8117.0s)]
*  So it shows a real fake triangle. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8121.96s)]
*  I saw another one where it was filmed from a cockpit and there's a very split second. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8123.92s)]
*  You can see something fly by and they've like still framed that. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8129.2s)]
*  I'll try to pull that up again. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8131.8s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out which link I had it on. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8132.8s)]
*  It's got to be so strange for you to go from not really having any understanding of these [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8136.64s)]
*  things to upgraded radar and then holy shit, you see them every day. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8143.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8149.64s)]
*  I mean, I wish it was, people always ask me, like, what was it like? [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8150.64s)]
*  And it was never this just like come to Jesus moment where it was like, you know, oh my [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8154.08s)]
*  God, there's, you know, UAP here. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8157.72s)]
*  We were very pragmatic about it until we were really at a time. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8160.56s)]
*  This was in the hearing, I think. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8165.200000000001s)]
*  Flash by super quick there. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8167.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8169.280000000001s)]
*  And then someone took a still of it as it flashes by, right? [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8170.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8173.84s)]
*  So whatever that thing is just whips by. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8175.84s)]
*  So this is what they were shown in a hearing in Congress. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8181.84s)]
*  Those pilots didn't wander up to that object, right? [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8187.400000000001s)]
*  Like they had radar on it. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8189.6s)]
*  They had the FLIR on it if they were carrying a FLIR. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8190.76s)]
*  And the only reason they showed that was because they didn't have to declassify it. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8193.88s)]
*  It was an air cruise phone, right? [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8196.88s)]
*  So there's this beast of an animal that surrounds us, which is the US classification system. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8198.88s)]
*  And, you know, the default is that stuff is classified more or less, right? [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8204.88s)]
*  And so, you know, that is something that needs to be contended with by, you know, Aero, by [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8209.88s)]
*  the groups actively working in this because they have to essentially work against that [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8215.88s)]
*  system, right? [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8219.88s)]
*  It's not intended to release information to the public. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8220.88s)]
*  That's not why it's designed. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8223.039999999999s)]
*  It's designed to the opposite of that. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8224.039999999999s)]
*  In terms of like these images that have been released, what to you is the most compelling? [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8229.039999999999s)]
*  Have you seen any of them that have been really fascinating to you? [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8234.039999999999s)]
*  I have heard that there's some incontrovertibly interesting stuff floating around now. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8241.039999999999s)]
*  So, yes, like we said, in the past there's been stuff. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8248.039999999999s)]
*  But now that there's been an actual reporting mechanism since, you know, the UAP Task Force [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8251.2s)]
*  started that proactive system. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8255.2s)]
*  And since then, there has been recordings of things that are now floating around, you [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8256.2s)]
*  know, the general classified network that's not like some buried secret that people, you [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8261.2s)]
*  know, that people with the proper access can go and verify themselves, frankly. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8266.2s)]
*  And, you know, I've met some of these people that have done their own homework and they're [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8271.2s)]
*  incredibly passionate about volunteering their time to help. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8275.2s)]
*  Some of them are helping me within the AIAA because they understand that, you know, we're [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8278.36s)]
*  entering a new realm of understanding our world, I think. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8282.36s)]
*  So you've heard that there's some evidence that we're not privy to or that... [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8285.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's general public. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8290.36s)]
*  I mean, I have no doubt that there's a plethora of images, classified images, that, you know, [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8292.36s)]
*  will give us a lot more to talk about than that frame or two that we just saw. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8298.36s)]
*  Do you have any hope that that stuff will ultimately be released? [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8302.36s)]
*  I think that there is a pathway there. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8305.52s)]
*  I do think there is a pathway for the declassification of data so that the scientific community can [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8308.52s)]
*  better understand it. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8314.52s)]
*  I have been working with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics with some [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8317.52s)]
*  of the emerging players within this landscape, I'll say. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8321.52s)]
*  And we've been working very hard to see how we can, you know, the organization that we [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8326.52s)]
*  put together, how we can help those other institutions in the near future. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8329.52s)]
*  So that in the near future, you know, we'll be able to announce some of those collaborations [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8334.68s)]
*  so that the general public can better understand the type of work that we're going to be doing. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8338.68s)]
*  What do you think the benefit for the government to release that information? [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8343.68s)]
*  Like, why would they be transparent about it? [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8348.68s)]
*  Why wouldn't they just continue to sort of dismiss it and, look, we had our little hearings [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8351.24s)]
*  and let's just go about our business and whatever we get, we'll keep to ourselves? [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8356.140000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8360.640000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8361.640000000001s)]
*  Well, part of me wants to say, hey, maybe it's kind of a changing of the guard of a bit, right? [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8362.76s)]
*  It's been a while if all the stories are to be believed and it's kind of a new generation [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8367.76s)]
*  of people that kind of grew up in a more open society in a bit, I feel. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8373.439999999999s)]
*  Maybe less inclined to just bury everything away for the greater good. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8377.76s)]
*  And that's pure speculation, right? [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8381.68s)]
*  That's how I feel, perhaps, you know, as a bit of a new guard into this topic, you know. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8383.88s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I don't think, you know, I don't know and I hope we find out, right? [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8390.04s)]
*  I hope we kind of get the debrief at the end of the day one day, but I don't know if we'll get that. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8396.04s)]
*  Because you've been open about this and I know you did Lex Friedman's podcast, you've discussed this [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8401.04s)]
*  and I saw some other things about you discussing this online. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8406.04s)]
*  What has been the reaction from other people? [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8410.04s)]
*  Have you received more information, have people reached out to you to talk to you about things that they've seen? [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8415.64s)]
*  Have you received criticism from discussing this openly? [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8422.64s)]
*  I have not received criticism for talking about it openly. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8426.64s)]
*  I think there was a period of time where, as to be expected, my former colleagues were treating this [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8430.64s)]
*  like a joke, like it was, you know, in the ready room. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8436.64s)]
*  But ECHO shut down pretty quickly from what I've heard. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8439.64s)]
*  And generally speaking, you know, I've had people reach out, you know, with support, people incredibly passionate about this topic. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8443.039999999999s)]
*  You know, I like the word latent demand now because in a sense, all the stories and topics and [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8450.039999999999s)]
*  obscuration on this topic hasn't made people's interest go away. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8458.039999999999s)]
*  It just kind of bottled it up in a sense, at least what I hear. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8462.039999999999s)]
*  Because I have, you know, every day people emailing me saying, you know, [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8466.039999999999s)]
*  thank you, I can feel like I can talk about this now in like a respectful manner. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8469.44s)]
*  I can, you know, I'm a professor at a college and we're going to start looking into this with the students [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8472.44s)]
*  because the students are super passionate about this. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8476.44s)]
*  And so, you know, I think the younger generation is very easy to accept and integrate, you know, the possibility, I'll say. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8478.44s)]
*  Whereas the older guard is coming around in a sense. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8486.44s)]
*  So I do think that it is possible, I would say, for, you know, like we talked about, [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8489.44s)]
*  as this, you know, this technology change happens with people moving into that technology faster and faster [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8494.84s)]
*  and it kind of leaves our society behind in a bit. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8499.84s)]
*  I think the same thing is going to happen with this topic, right? [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8502.84s)]
*  Like there are people that are going to be able to integrate this into the reality faster or sooner than other people. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8504.84s)]
*  And, you know, much like technology, there's going to be advantages to people that do integrate that information. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8510.84s)]
*  But the hope is that I think we'll get everyone there one day. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8516.84s)]
*  Yeah. And the hope for me is that people release more of this stuff, [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8521.24s)]
*  like the leaks that Jeremy Corbell has gotten about like the transmedium device and some of the other things. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8526.24s)]
*  There was another one where there was those pyramid-shaped objects that were flying over and was it an aircraft carrier? [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8533.24s)]
*  Some ship. I don't think it was a carrier. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8541.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8543.24s)]
*  I think it was like a destroyer or something like that. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8544.24s)]
*  What did you think of those videos? [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8545.24s)]
*  There's a lot of like... [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8548.24s)]
*  You can find that, Jamie. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8550.64s)]
*  It's really weird. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8551.64s)]
*  They're like pyramids and they're flying around like these things. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8552.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8558.64s)]
*  Flashing triangular-shaped object shown through a night vision camera over the USS Russell [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8559.64s)]
*  and footage leaked to Jeremy Corbell. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8567.64s)]
*  Did you watch that footage at all? [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8570.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8574.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8576.039999999999s)]
*  People, I know we're nugget down and kind of arguing about the shape of the object, right? [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8578.039999999999s)]
*  Triangle or not. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8583.039999999999s)]
*  I told people, I don't give a shit what it's shaped like. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8585.039999999999s)]
*  Like these things should not be flying over a US destroyer, like regardless. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8587.039999999999s)]
*  Like let's focus on the right things here. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8591.039999999999s)]
*  There's a sense that if something can be prosaically explained, then it must be, right? [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8594.039999999999s)]
*  If there's an unknown object that has a light on it, it's impossible for it to be a UAP [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8600.44s)]
*  because UAV have lights and they need lights. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8607.44s)]
*  So that's the simplest explanation and therefore everything else is negated, right? [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8610.44s)]
*  And you need to have that exceptional evidence for it to even be considered. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8614.44s)]
*  I don't care, right? [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8619.44s)]
*  It's near a naval asset and that's our airspace. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8621.44s)]
*  Whether the shape is interesting or not is irrelevant. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8626.84s)]
*  Like it's a massive security flaw to have objects like that flying near a ship. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8629.84s)]
*  It's a travesty if that's what our Navy is allowing foreign adversaries to do. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8634.84s)]
*  So that needs to get fixed and if it's not foreign adversaries, [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8640.84s)]
*  then we need to better understand that as well. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8643.84s)]
*  If you had a pile of chips and you were going to push it into like red or black, [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8646.84s)]
*  red is some sort of human-based technology, black is aliens. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8656.24s)]
*  Can we say other instead of aliens? [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8662.24s)]
*  Just something crazy. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8664.24s)]
*  Other. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8665.24s)]
*  Non-human intelligence. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8666.24s)]
*  Non-human intelligence. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8667.24s)]
*  Something from somewhere else, [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8668.24s)]
*  whether it's another dimension, another planet. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8670.24s)]
*  What do you think? [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8672.24s)]
*  I think there's another actor involved. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8673.24s)]
*  I think there is another. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8676.24s)]
*  I think that there is something that is not human that is interacting in some fashion. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8678.24s)]
*  I don't know whether it comes from somewhere else or was here before [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8683.64s)]
*  or comes from something we don't understand, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8686.64s)]
*  but there is a segment of the data that is just not explainable at this point. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8688.64s)]
*  And from my experience, again, not 100%, not binary, [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8694.64s)]
*  but on the scale, that's the direction that I've continued to move in [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8700.64s)]
*  based off what I've seen and I haven't had any reason to go the other way. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8705.64s)]
*  Do you bounce around possibilities in your head [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8710.039999999999s)]
*  of whether or not this thing is interdimensional from another planet? [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8714.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8719.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the dimensional thing is interesting in a lot of different ways. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8720.039999999999s)]
*  We obviously, you know, obviously, [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8725.039999999999s)]
*  but, you know, we don't necessarily evolve to see reality, right? [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8727.039999999999s)]
*  We evolve to survive in our environment as we talked about before. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8732.039999999999s)]
*  And our interaction with this 3D space-time or 4D, I should say, [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8737.44s)]
*  may not be the complete picture. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8742.44s)]
*  You know, we call things other dimensions or X, Y, or Z, [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8744.44s)]
*  but what does that really mean? [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8747.44s)]
*  Does that mean a consciousness that's bound in an electromagnetic pattern? [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8750.44s)]
*  Is that a higher dimension or is that a life form occurring in three-dimensional space? [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8754.44s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that, right? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8761.44s)]
*  It's kind of a nuanced discussion. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8762.44s)]
*  I think that at the end of the day, [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8764.84s)]
*  we don't really fully understand our universe well enough [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8765.84s)]
*  to fit it into one of the buckets that we've already defined. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8767.84s)]
*  You know, I think there's undefined buckets [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8770.84s)]
*  that could be a participant in this conversation. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8772.84s)]
*  Not that I say to know where they are, right? [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8774.84s)]
*  But I'm just assuming that there's unknowns, [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8776.84s)]
*  you know, in the makeup of our universe, [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8778.84s)]
*  whether it's the 3D, you know, 4D space-time [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8780.84s)]
*  or whether it's something beyond space-time. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8782.84s)]
*  And I don't know what those unknowns are, where they could live. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8786.84s)]
*  There's your classic, you know, vision of time travelers [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8789.84s)]
*  kind of stepping outside of our space-time into, you know, another land. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8793.24s)]
*  There's also another quote-unquote, you know, dimension [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8797.24s)]
*  if we think about, you know, quantum, [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8800.24s)]
*  the quantum regime and, you know, wave functions [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8802.24s)]
*  and, you know, one interpretation [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8805.24s)]
*  has those wave functions not collapsing, right? [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8807.24s)]
*  And so then there's multiple realities [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8810.24s)]
*  of all possibilities happening at once. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8812.24s)]
*  So there's lots of different definitions of multi-dimensional [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8814.24s)]
*  and I think we're just still scraping the surface as it is [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8818.24s)]
*  and we're going to learn more about where things could come from in the future. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8821.64s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope so. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8824.64s)]
*  One of the things that gives me hope is the fact [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8826.64s)]
*  that this is discussed openly now [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8828.64s)]
*  as opposed to when I was younger, [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8830.64s)]
*  when I was a kid, if you talked about UFOs, [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8832.64s)]
*  you were kind of a fool. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8834.64s)]
*  You were a silly person that was, you know, [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8836.64s)]
*  you were, you know, it's like talking about [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8838.64s)]
*  elves or, you know, leprechauns or something. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8840.64s)]
*  It was dumb. Like, why are you concerning yourself with UFOs? [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8843.64s)]
*  Those are all silly stories. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8846.64s)]
*  The only one that was really compelling [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8848.64s)]
*  was the Roswell story [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8851.039999999999s)]
*  because the Roswell story was actually reported in the newspaper [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8853.039999999999s)]
*  that they recovered a crashed UFO [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8855.039999999999s)]
*  and then, you know, [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8857.039999999999s)]
*  they actually flew it to [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8859.039999999999s)]
*  I think it was Wright-Patterson Air Force Base [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8861.039999999999s)]
*  in two separate jets. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8863.039999999999s)]
*  They flew the wreckage [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8865.039999999999s)]
*  in case one of them goes down, [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8867.039999999999s)]
*  they still have some of the wreckage in one of the jets [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8869.039999999999s)]
*  which was amazing at the time. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8871.039999999999s)]
*  You know, but [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8873.039999999999s)]
*  then the next day they said it was a balloon, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8875.039999999999s)]
*  it was a mistake and who knows what that was. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8877.039999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how much of you looked into that story. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8879.44s)]
*  I've read Corso's book. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8883.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8885.44s)]
*  You know, so I've got that perspective, of course, [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8887.44s)]
*  kind of read the mainstream interpretation of it. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8889.44s)]
*  What was Corso's perspective on it? [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8891.44s)]
*  What did he think? [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8893.44s)]
*  Well, he kind of broke down this whole [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8895.44s)]
*  you know, he told the UFO story [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8897.44s)]
*  as much as you could tell it. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8899.44s)]
*  I'm not necessarily vouching for any of it [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8901.44s)]
*  but he really goes into, you know, details [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8903.44s)]
*  like you just described around moving things around [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8905.44s)]
*  and technologies that could have been [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8907.84s)]
*  you know, observed things of that nature. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8909.84s)]
*  Again, you know, [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8911.84s)]
*  stuff almost like Bob Lazar [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8913.84s)]
*  where he's highlighting technologies [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8915.84s)]
*  and describing one way that we now recognize [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8917.84s)]
*  things like fiber optics and things of that nature. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8919.84s)]
*  So, you know, [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8921.84s)]
*  I don't know where the truth lays [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8923.84s)]
*  but again, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8925.84s)]
*  it's all being clouded by [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8927.84s)]
*  this classification system, right? [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8929.84s)]
*  The full story is still classified. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8931.84s)]
*  What happens when you have information gap like that [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8933.84s)]
*  and people just fill it in? [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8935.84s)]
*  You know, recently [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8937.84s)]
*  there was, you know, communication about how [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8939.84s)]
*  one of the, I think it was the Aviation [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8943.84s)]
*  Intelligence Service of, gosh, [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8945.84s)]
*  what's the Navy, I forget, but they released a patch [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8947.84s)]
*  with the UFO on it, like a straight up UFO. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8949.84s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8951.84s)]
*  And they took it down, then they took it down like a week later. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8953.84s)]
*  Did they? They took it down? [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8955.84s)]
*  They took it down and said it was an accident. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8957.84s)]
*  What? How could it be an accident? [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8959.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8961.84s)]
*  How was the design? How was the design an accident? [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8963.84s)]
*  It's like a federal website. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8965.84s)]
*  You don't just accidentally post the wrong GIF on a website like that. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8967.84s)]
*  I thought it was pretty cool. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8969.84s)]
*  Jeremy actually made t-shirts out of it. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8971.84s)]
*  But then, you know, some of the talk was [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8975.84s)]
*  everyone got too excited about that [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8977.84s)]
*  and you made the assumption that there's UFOs [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8979.84s)]
*  and they're doing it there. And it's like, well, one, of course [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8981.84s)]
*  that's the assumption that was made. But two, [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8983.84s)]
*  that's what happens when you just hide information. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8985.84s)]
*  Don't chastise us for not [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8987.84s)]
*  like, for filling in the gaps, right? [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8989.84s)]
*  Like, that's not our fault. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8991.84s)]
*  I think there's a real fear [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8993.84s)]
*  of admitting that there's something [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8995.84s)]
*  that we can't control that's [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8997.84s)]
*  technologically superior to us [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=8999.84s)]
*  that can visit. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9001.84s)]
*  If I was running [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9003.84s)]
*  the country, I would like [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9005.84s)]
*  to have the ability to say [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9007.84s)]
*  that we're in control of everything. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9009.84s)]
*  That there's not some super intelligent [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9011.84s)]
*  beings that we don't understand [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9013.84s)]
*  at all that are using technology [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9015.84s)]
*  that's indescribable [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9017.84s)]
*  and they're visiting us all the time. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9019.84s)]
*  And some of them [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9021.84s)]
*  we can't even see. We don't even [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9023.84s)]
*  detect them until we lock [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9025.84s)]
*  onto them with superior radar. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9027.84s)]
*  I mean, that [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9029.84s)]
*  alone, I mean, that puts you in a position [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9031.84s)]
*  of like, well, you're not the [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9033.84s)]
*  boss, they're the boss. You're just [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9035.84s)]
*  like the fucking general manager. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9037.84s)]
*  You know? And I mean, think [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9041.84s)]
*  that's what I would be [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9043.84s)]
*  worried about if I was going to release that [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9045.84s)]
*  information if I was in a position [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9047.84s)]
*  of power. If I was [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9049.84s)]
*  an admiral or general or president, [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9051.84s)]
*  I would be like, don't tell them. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9053.84s)]
*  They're just going to freak out. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9055.84s)]
*  I feel like our society is more adaptable and [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9057.84s)]
*  flexible now. Just with the tools we have [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9059.84s)]
*  and the way we communicate, you know, [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9061.84s)]
*  and the way we can break [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9063.84s)]
*  down problems and share them digitally. I think [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9065.84s)]
*  now it would be easier to integrate problems [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9067.84s)]
*  like that because it's easier for people to do their [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9069.84s)]
*  own homework and integrate it. Whereas, you know, [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9071.84s)]
*  fifties and sixties, everyone's just [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9073.84s)]
*  circled up on the TV and just getting pumped [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9075.84s)]
*  with whatever information [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9077.84s)]
*  goes out, right? Yeah, that's true. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9079.84s)]
*  That's true, is that there's [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9081.84s)]
*  a general accepting [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9083.84s)]
*  of access to information that [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9085.84s)]
*  just wasn't the case before the internet. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9087.84s)]
*  Yeah. And so, yeah, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9089.84s)]
*  I think we are a more adaptable, you know, [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9091.84s)]
*  society now, for better or worse. You know, [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9093.84s)]
*  we have the ability to find our own tribes, [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9095.84s)]
*  right, and to find comfort [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9097.84s)]
*  with others that have the same ideas [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9099.84s)]
*  of us, whereas, you know, in the [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9101.84s)]
*  past, you were on your own island, in a sense, [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9103.84s)]
*  and so it was hard to cultivate those ideas. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9105.84s)]
*  Well, Ryan, [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9107.84s)]
*  thanks for doing this, man. Thanks for [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9109.84s)]
*  talking about this openly, and [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9111.84s)]
*  thanks for coming here and discussing it. It was [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9113.84s)]
*  really fascinating, and [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9115.84s)]
*  I hope we get to do this again someday. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9117.84s)]
*  Maybe there'll be some new information that comes out [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9119.84s)]
*  and some new revelations. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9121.84s)]
*  I think we will have some new information [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9123.84s)]
*  to talk about next time. Do you know something? [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9125.84s)]
*  Tell me now. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9127.84s)]
*  Tell me right now. Would you? Maybe [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9129.84s)]
*  tell me off the air. I won't tell anybody, I promise. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9131.84s)]
*  I will tell people. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9133.84s)]
*  I can't keep a secret about that. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9137.84s)]
*  It's too important. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9139.84s)]
*  But it's really fascinating stuff, [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9141.84s)]
*  man, and I mean, I [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9143.84s)]
*  don't know what to think of it sometimes. Sometimes I [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9145.84s)]
*  think about it too much. You know, [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9147.84s)]
*  one of the things that I got out of [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9149.84s)]
*  talking to Commander David Fravor [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9151.84s)]
*  was that that, [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9153.84s)]
*  I mean, I'm just guessing, but that [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9155.84s)]
*  instance of the [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9157.84s)]
*  seeing that thing [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9159.84s)]
*  and watching that thing [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9161.84s)]
*  exhibit capabilities beyond our imagination, [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9163.84s)]
*  that's got to stay with you every day. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9167.84s)]
*  Like that, no matter [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9169.84s)]
*  what you do, whatever, what's on Netflix, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9171.84s)]
*  I don't know, but there's fucking aliens out there. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9173.84s)]
*  You know? [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9175.84s)]
*  Whatever you think is [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9177.84s)]
*  important, that has got to [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9179.84s)]
*  be in your consciousness, [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9181.84s)]
*  like right there, [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9183.84s)]
*  next to you, all the time. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9185.84s)]
*  Because he's experienced something [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9187.84s)]
*  personally that [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9189.84s)]
*  very, very few human [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9191.84s)]
*  beings will ever be able to comprehend [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9193.84s)]
*  what it feels like to watch. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9195.84s)]
*  And to know that [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9197.84s)]
*  that's out there. And to know [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9199.84s)]
*  that all of the boundaries that we think of, [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9201.84s)]
*  in terms of just propulsion systems, [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9206.84s)]
*  technology, and whether or not [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9211.84s)]
*  we are actually in contact [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9213.84s)]
*  on a regular basis with something from somewhere else. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9215.84s)]
*  Imagine having that confidence, that knowledge. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9218.84s)]
*  You know? Wild. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9220.84s)]
*  Dave's story is incredible. Wild. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9222.84s)]
*  To see the Tic Tac like that and hear him tell it, yeah. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9224.84s)]
*  And the thing that was under the water [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9226.84s)]
*  that the Tic Tac was interacting with. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9228.84s)]
*  That's fascinating as well. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9230.84s)]
*  That there might have been some sort of a mothership [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9232.84s)]
*  or something below the surface of the water [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9235.84s)]
*  because of the way the water was reacting. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9237.84s)]
*  That, I mean, the transmedium aspect of this [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9239.84s)]
*  is really fascinating to me [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9243.84s)]
*  because it makes so much sense [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9245.84s)]
*  that if they could fly through space [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9247.84s)]
*  and they could just, if they have this ability [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9249.84s)]
*  beyond our imagination, or [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9252.84s)]
*  maybe in tune with our imagination [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9254.84s)]
*  about propulsion systems and [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9256.84s)]
*  the ability to just move around instantaneously, [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9258.84s)]
*  why wouldn't they just go in the water? [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9261.84s)]
*  If they could do that, why would the water be so complicated for them [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9263.84s)]
*  if space isn't complicated? [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9266.84s)]
*  The difference between space and our atmosphere, you know, [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9268.84s)]
*  it's quite the thickness difference, right? [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9271.84s)]
*  And so that's why things heat up when they come back from space. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9274.84s)]
*  And really it's the same problem, right? [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9277.84s)]
*  If you can just do that without that happening, [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9279.84s)]
*  transition seamlessly from space to air, [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9282.84s)]
*  then it should be the same principles [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9285.84s)]
*  essentially go from air to water. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9287.84s)]
*  Especially if they're doing it with some method [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9289.84s)]
*  that's similar to what Bob Lazar described [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9291.84s)]
*  of just completely manipulating space and time around them. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9293.84s)]
*  You'd think if you saw that, [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9296.84s)]
*  there'd be some interesting detection methods you could do [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9298.84s)]
*  or maybe like a redshift. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9300.84s)]
*  If you were to beam light at it [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9303.84s)]
*  and then record some of it coming back, [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9305.84s)]
*  you could see perhaps how that light shifted [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9307.84s)]
*  due to the gravitational effects. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9309.84s)]
*  Or if you had a sensor on each side, [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9311.84s)]
*  and just like we bend light around a star or a planet, [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9313.84s)]
*  to see things behind it, perhaps we could observe a bending [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9316.84s)]
*  if we had sensors on both sides, [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9320.84s)]
*  which sounds difficult, but when you have, say, [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9322.84s)]
*  maybe a bunch of fighter jets flying around, [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9325.84s)]
*  they're all in a data link pumping the information together, [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9327.84s)]
*  over a period of time, they're going to be in that position [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9329.84s)]
*  just due to random chance in a sense. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9332.84s)]
*  So it's about collecting data over time [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9334.84s)]
*  versus getting it perfectly. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9336.84s)]
*  Has there ever been any discussion of devising some sort of a plane [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9338.84s)]
*  or some sort of a jet or something [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9343.84s)]
*  that just goes out to try to collect data on these things? [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9345.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the area is not totally closed off. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9349.84s)]
*  You could take an aircraft over there or a ship over there. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9354.84s)]
*  But that's also why we don't test equipment out there, [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9357.84s)]
*  because it's just international water, right? [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9359.84s)]
*  So that's why it's like, [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9361.84s)]
*  hey, why would we be testing our own equipment here, [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9362.84s)]
*  because anyone can take a boat over here [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9364.84s)]
*  and look up and start sniffing around. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9366.84s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't know how to answer that question further. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9372.84s)]
*  Well, listen, the problem with this is, [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9376.84s)]
*  I always love to come to a conclusion, [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9378.84s)]
*  oh, well, it's this, and that's that, now we know. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9380.84s)]
*  The end. There's no the end here. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9383.84s)]
*  You're right. We haven't finished our story yet. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9386.84s)]
*  But just to kind of give you from some of my perspective, [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9388.84s)]
*  this conversation is still ongoing. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9392.84s)]
*  I think that more resources and more energy [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9394.84s)]
*  and more people are getting involved. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9397.84s)]
*  I see us moving this conversation forward both technologically. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9399.84s)]
*  I think that we're going to be able to better understand [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9404.84s)]
*  not only where the objects are and how they kind of relate to each other [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9406.84s)]
*  and the locations and some things about that, [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9410.84s)]
*  but I think we'll better understand repulsion. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9413.84s)]
*  I think we'll better understand some of the data [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9415.84s)]
*  that has been collected in the recent past [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9419.84s)]
*  so that we can move the conversation forward technologically, [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9422.84s)]
*  as a society, as a people, and study this [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9425.84s)]
*  from all the different societal angles [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9428.84s)]
*  that it's going to need for us to fully integrate it. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9430.84s)]
*  I think that in the next few years, [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9432.84s)]
*  we're going to have the proper institutions, [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9435.84s)]
*  both in the government and in the commercial and academic world, [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9437.84s)]
*  in order to fully integrate this without needing to build new stuff, [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9441.84s)]
*  not exposing the populace to this information, [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9446.84s)]
*  saying, okay, wait for your institutions to catch up. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9449.84s)]
*  I see that landscape being built, [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9451.84s)]
*  and I think it's going to be interesting when we have the tools within our society [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9454.84s)]
*  to really flesh out what this information means. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9459.84s)]
*  Well, I, for one, can't wait to meet our alien overlords. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9462.84s)]
*  I just want to see. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9468.84s)]
*  I think this is all emerging, and it's really fascinating. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9470.84s)]
*  I think about it too much. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9473.84s)]
*  Obviously, look at this place. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9475.84s)]
*  I've got a UFO on the desk. There's one behind me. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9477.84s)]
*  It's a problem. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9479.84s)]
*  I've left my employer to start to engage in this full-time, [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9481.84s)]

*  More to be revealed next time, but like I said, [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9490.84s)]
*  there's a landscape spinning up, [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9493.84s)]
*  and I think this fall and this next winter, [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9495.84s)]
*  I think we'll have some more open conversation [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9498.84s)]
*  about what that short-term future is going to look like. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muxP-2pDzH0&t=9500.84s)]
