# Joe Rogan Experience #2192 - Raanan Hershberg
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Unt5z8hJr4)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  What's up?
*  Hey, how's it going?
*  Thanks for coming in.
*  My pleasure.
*  What's going on?
*  It's an honor.
*  Good to be here.
*  The cold showers, what we were talking about before, those are the hardest.
*  Oh, well, New York City cold showers in the winter are brutal.
*  Because it doesn't get your whole body so you actually have to go to the bathroom.
*  It doesn't get your whole body so you actually have to constantly move around and re-freeze your ass off.
*  It's hard to breathe, too.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I used to do them for a while, though.
*  When I was a kid, when I used to do martial arts, there was this dude I used to work out with named Bob Cafarella.
*  And he was like a real psycho.
*  And Bob used to always take cold showers.
*  He said it was good for the spirit.
*  And we would all be sitting around going, what the fuck is wrong with him?
*  This guy's in the shower.
*  It was January in Boston.
*  This guy's in the shower, just fucking freezing.
*  But I feel like when you do it, it's like you feel afterwards this awakeness that you only get with drugs.
*  Like that fucking like, oh, I'm...
*  Like you never realize how not present you are until you take a cold plunge.
*  And then you're like, oh, now I'm fucking in the world.
*  Right, because your body's trying to protect you from dying.
*  Which is a real rush.
*  But it really is, though. It's norepinephrine. That's the big one.
*  Dopamine kicks up. Everything kicks up. And it lasts for hours.
*  That's what I tell people, even though they don't want to do it.
*  I'm like, I know it sucks.
*  I don't think it's good. I don't get in and go, this is amazing. I'm the best.
*  I get in and I go, oh, fucking Jesus Christ. Just keep it together.
*  And I just try to stay calm. But I know when I get out, I'm going to feel great for hours.
*  Exactly.
*  Hours and hours.
*  Except for the time I did it. On your instruction. And fucked up.
*  But it was like jackass doing it at home and getting a nut ripped off.
*  I did the... I saw you do it. It looked great.
*  Put the ice in the bath. And I was just cold for like two days straight. It was crazy.
*  Yeah. I wouldn't recommend doing it for ten minutes the first time.
*  You went a little crazy.
*  I went a little crazy.
*  Yeah. But kudos to you for doing it. It's fucking hard to do ten minutes.
*  Well, I don't like... I used to do a lot of drugs. I don't really do drugs anymore.
*  I mean, I'll do edibles. And occasionally create them. So I guess I do some drugs.
*  And I'll do cocaine and heroin. But I'm pretty clean other than that.
*  I mean, I eat processed foods and a lot of dessert. But fuck it.
*  I mean, crystal meth. But that's it.
*  And I drink whiskey. No rocks.
*  But I don't do like the big drugs. So the cold plunge is really the closest to get to that high.
*  Yeah. If you could get that in a pill, it would be a very popular pill. People would be taking it all day long.
*  I know. But part of it is probably going through the pain, right?
*  Yeah. This is better for your brain. Because there's a thing... there's a part in your brain...
*  Andrew Huberman has talked about this. I forget what it's actually called.
*  But there's a part of your brain that actually grows when you force yourself into do difficult things.
*  Like say if you're a person who likes to run and you force yourself, I'm going to run five miles every morning for 60 days.
*  Like if you can actually do that... So an asshole. Yeah.
*  This is my friend, Cam. I'm trying to imagine myself running.
*  I have a buddy of mine that was doing a marathon every day. Oh, really? Yeah. He's a psycho.
*  He does these ultra marathons where they run for three days.
*  It's like Forrest Gump. No, Forrest Gump was running.
*  Yeah. He ran across America. But they do these things through the mountains.
*  Like they do the Moab. I think it's the Moab 200 or 240. So it's 240 miles through mountains.
*  It's not just like straight 240 miles. Like you're going over mountains and hills and shit.
*  I can run for about seven minutes and I'm probably lying about that.
*  I'm definitely lying. I can run for about four minutes before I have to like stop.
*  I used to not run at all. And then I entered into a 5k and I couldn't believe how hard it was to do.
*  It's insane. I thought I was in reasonably good shape.
*  Yeah. It's crazy how much more in shape other people are.
*  Especially running shape. Like the runners are people who can do the sprints.
*  They can do something for like a really long time that I can do for maybe like two seconds.
*  I think they're drug addicts too though. Yeah. Natural drugs. The natural runner's high.
*  What do you call it? Aphedrine? Not aphedrine. Euphoria. Whatever that thing is.
*  Runner's euphoria. Yeah. I don't know what the actual chemicals that get released during a runner's high.
*  We'll find that out. It's got to be dopamine.
*  But there's a thing that you do when you do a lot of cardio where you do get really high.
*  Not high in a bad way, but high in like a very chilled endorphins.
*  Endorphins. Yeah. Popular culture identifies these chemicals behind the runner's high.
*  So you just, it says a short lasting. I don't think it's that short lasting.
*  But you have to do it for a while. You have to run for like I think 45 minutes.
*  Oh here it goes. It says up to a few hours. That makes sense.
*  So the bliss, it can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.
*  But it's side effects. Yeah. No. I mean that's when you don't do drugs like that's the only way.
*  Yeah. My dad plays tennis every day for like five hours.
*  That's a good thing. Yeah. That's a great thing. He's obsessed.
*  He watches. All he does is play tennis or watch tennis. Really?
*  Just a tennis freak. He's a tennis freak. And he's retired. So he just plays tennis all day.
*  Just plays tennis. He has one of those rackets where you, he's a real nerd about where you plug it into the computer and look at the data.
*  Whoa. And then he's either playing tennis or doing that or just watching tennis on TV.
*  Wow. That's all he cares about.
*  See that's one if you get into you you're relying on your vehicle unfortunately.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know like if you're getting into chess you could pretty much always move those fucking things around.
*  Yeah. Yeah. If you really get obsessed with chess. Chess is my favorite sport.
*  Really? I'm only out of breath after the first 45.
*  Do you play chess? I used to play chess. I used to be in the chess club. Oh no kidding.
*  I don't play anymore as well but I love chess. Yeah. I'm scared of chess. Really? Yeah I'm scared I'd get addicted to it.
*  Well that's okay. It's not crack. Right. I don't have any time. That's why I won't play golf. Same thing.
*  I'm sure. The golfers like Jamie's big golfer they'll tell you how awesome it is. I'm like I believe you.
*  I'm not going to try it. I'm not going to let it get its fucking fangs into me.
*  That's how I feel about video games. Oh yeah. My comic friend play video games and I'm like I think that's the worst drug.
*  Because then you're just doing, you're just wasting your life. There's no intervention.
*  Also it doesn't have to be sunny out. Yeah exactly. You could fucking be three in the morning like I don't want to go to bed.
*  I was at my brother's place. I played a video game once and I hadn't played it since like Goldeneye.
*  So I hadn't seen any of the improvements. So I started playing. Oh wow. They're like movies now. It's like crazy. Yeah.
*  And I got so hooked there was a moment where I just like saw myself being addicted and just like snapped out of it.
*  It was like four hours straight. Yeah. I had to quit cold turkey. I used to play Quake online.
*  It gets, it like numbs you out. It's crazy. It's just too easy to get a game. Yeah. Because you could always, at any moment in time,
*  I could either be bored. I could be having a conversation that's boring. Right. Or I could be doing something boring. Right.
*  Or I can just log in and have a death match one on one with some dude from fucking Denmark. I know. You know like it's crazy.
*  Like I remember typing like where do you live? And then people are like I'm in Estonia. Like whoa that's crazy.
*  Like you're killing them. You kill each other and you make little pauses and you ask. It's fun. It's crazy. Yeah it's fun.
*  I just yeah I'm afraid to like waste all that time. 100 percent. I'm like an a workaholic a bit.
*  Which obviously you are. Yeah but that's I think that's okay. As long as you're doing something that you actually enjoy.
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with being obsessed with something. Yeah. No I'm not a workaholic.
*  When I worked at Red Lobster I was not a workaholic. When I worked at Frish's Big Boy I was not. Exactly.
*  Let's get this right. I think that's the deal with a lot of kids that are bored in school and they're calling them ADHD.
*  I think they think that the subjects that are being discussed are boring as fuck. Of course. They're bouncing off the walls.
*  They're 13 years old. They have so much fucking energy. Why is it never the teacher's fault? Exactly.
*  It's like why do the teachers say something interesting? It's insane. It's like to be like oh no no they're just.
*  It's like if an audience doesn't laugh and you're like no no no it's not that I'm not funny. It's that you have laughing deficit disorder.
*  It's like yeah it's throwing the ball onto something else. Be interesting.
*  There was an article in one of the science journals recently about when the science magazines recently about ADHD.
*  And then they were saying that it is it was actually an advantage to think that way for hunter gatherers. Oh wow.
*  And that that's this is left over from where they're constantly looking at other things and trying to pay it and they could focus on one thing like very intensely.
*  But they're scanning for a bunch of other stuff. You notice yeah you're like what's that? And then it's like a raspberry.
*  Also they're always in activity in motion. ADHD may have evolved to help foragers know when to cut their losses.
*  Oh interesting. You're too focused. You get killed. This is not the one that I read because this is from February.
*  The one I read was just a couple of days ago but symptoms attention deficit hyperactivity disorder such as impulsivity may have helped foragers and hunter gatherers quickly move on to new areas when food sources were low.
*  That's amazing. So if you're too focused you you don't you don't know when to quit. Right. And then you get fucking killed or you run out of resources.
*  That makes sense. Like you got it's like an instinct. Let's get the fuck out of here. Right.
*  And now. Yeah. Well you know I got really addicted to adderall like everyone. Oh wow. I'm scared of that too. I've never tried it.
*  I used to when I was in after college I started taking it like recreationally.
*  I went to a psychiatrist and told her I had a problem and she was like well we can prescribe it for you.
*  Oh Jesus Christ. That'll no longer be a problem. Oh my God. I was like OK. I was thinking more like rehab but she's probably on adderall right now.
*  It's amazing. Why don't you join me. It's insane. Let's clean my house. I did it for like I got super I was doing 90 milligrams a day. I was like. Is that a lot Jamie?
*  What is a normal dose. 10. When I did 20 I was fucking up for 48 hours or something like that.
*  It's crystal meth for nerds but it's crystal meth. I mean it's fucking it's like it's intense. I was so cocky. I wrote poetry. That's how high I was.
*  I thought I could write poetry. This this gentleman Norman Oler was on my podcast two weeks ago and he wrote all about the third Reich.
*  Dude it's crazy and speed. Yeah the whole thing was meth. They were all messed up. They were messed up when they fucking did the blitzkrieg.
*  I do a bit about that now that Hitler being on speed. I'm obsessed with Hitler. Oh man. I have like one of my bookshelves is just all Holocaust and Hitler books.
*  Really. Yeah but I'm dying to read that. I know Goring was on everything. You were all on everything.
*  Goring was on like huge painkillers the whole time. He was Hitler. Hitler was on. One of the things the misconceptions that he was on meth.
*  It appears a lot of what he was on was oxys. He was on oxycodone. Yeah they had the original oxycodone.
*  So they're just like hot. It's like when you get high you run over someone. They're just like they were like what the fuck did I do when I was high.
*  They don't even care. I killed all the Jews. Did you ever see that video of the lady who's on pills and the cops are telling her to pull over and she doesn't know why and she has no wheel on her car.
*  Her car is like spitting flames. Have you ever seen it. And they pull over and she's like what's the problem.
*  The cops are like man are you on pills. Like what the fuck is going on. How do you not know you lost a wheel on the highway.
*  You know what. You got to see it. It's bunkers. No that's insane. Yeah it is like the Nazis were just all on drugs which is just like a crazy.
*  I mean the whole Third Reich is surreal that they're creating this. Look at this. So here's this lady. She's just driving like nothing's wrong.
*  Wave and hi. Another car near Quail Hill shopping center. She says her car just gave out. They say the woman was not impaired.
*  They didn't arrest her. What the fuck are you talking about. That lady's on pills. If she's not impaired she shouldn't be ever driving.
*  If you don't notice you lost a wheel. Right. That's a that's a big red flag. Did they do was that the same one that might not have even been the same one longer video of what was happening.
*  Look on the screen longer video. Right. OK. This is it. Like there's no way you don't know that. There's no way you don't know. Trucks open. Also the fucking back is completely open.
*  I say that's not even the big problem at this point. I can't imagine that she's not medicated. That doesn't make any sense to me.
*  Something's going on. If she isn't medicated she's like she's a psycho. Right. Something's wrong. If she's not medicated like she's got a blown fuse.
*  But also that's how cars get they catch fire like that. Like no that's insane. Yeah. No I. Yeah. This guy's saying erratic behavior. Are you having a hard day.
*  Well there we go. Now we're assholes. Well she's making it up. She might be making it up. She might be telling the truth which makes sense where you're like your whole world is like what is life.
*  I'm going to die real soon and they can't fix this and you're just the cars fucking. Yeah. I don't even care. Yeah. The patches open. You don't even care. Yeah. Your world is over or you're like oh shit.
*  I fucked up. Let me say something to get out of it right now. You're a cynic. I am an optimist. I look for the good in people. I did a show once when I was like younger and you know you already start you have like very I mean I guess I still have dark jokes but I'm having some joke about SIDS you know the sudden infant death.
*  Oh. And I was doing it was like some pizza shop in my hometown and an audience and one person looked really upset and I go what you don't like the joke and they're like our kid died of SIDS.
*  I immediately like went into like you know like when you're starting out I just went to the oldest safest material I'm like so I'm broke anyone else overdraft you know just go right into it.
*  Panic. And then at the end I went up to him and her and I apologize and he was like oh we're just joking.
*  That's the worst heckle ever. Oh that's so mean. But I stopped doing that kind of joke afterwards because like it's fine to do those kind of jokes but you have to be prepared. Right. I was not prepared. Like I don't want to upset people like that so I just.
*  Someone who lost their kid. Right. Sounds like I can't do those jokes.
*  You don't like I'm not against someone doing like that's like Anthony Jesselneck has a shit ton of jokes like that. Of course. Yeah. They're great. People enjoy it. It's not bad. It's not bad comedy. It's like but at least with a guy like Jesselneck you should know what you're getting into and don't try to pretend there's something wrong with what he's saying but all these other people don't have a problem with it. Right. It's a taste thing. Yeah exactly.
*  That's a like it's like but when you start out no one knows who you know no one knew who I was. Of course. Pizza shop in Bloomington Indiana. That's why it's so dangerous. Yeah. But the only way they're going to find out that's the kind of stuff you do is if you take those risks and do that kind of stuff and get in trouble. You got it you got to do that.
*  Yeah. You got to get in trouble. Yeah yeah yeah. I mean thank God I started before people film stuff. I said. How many years are you in now. 17. OK. That's great. That's great. I said all right. I'm not going to get in trouble.
*  But it's not on film. But you also you got in I think
*  The filming thing is fucking strange, right?
*  Because some people want to get filmed because you can get some clips like interacting with the audience, right?
*  But it's like you have to have an opportunity to work out stuff
*  Of course
*  Because there's times when you're on stage and you're saying things and you have a new bit and you don't know where you're taking
*  It while you're taking it of course. Yeah, and you have to like that's why when they look the Louie thing
*  Yeah, it was any comic who it like criticized them should lose their comedian badge right away. They have to me
*  Yeah, if you release something when they weren't planning it doesn't matter what they said it you're at fault for releasing something
*  Well, it's obviously as an audience member that released it, but the comics had criticized
*  I'm like, hey man, fuck you like you pretend first of all the guy didn't do comedy for ten months
*  Yeah
*  And then second the stuff that he was saying if you know him and you know his act and I guarantee you fucking do because a
*  Lot of those people are just haters. Yeah, if you know him, you know given enough time
*  He would make that horrible premise really fucking funny. Frankly is pretty funny that pretty funny then
*  Horrible these saying like push the fat kid in front of you
*  But that's funny
*  But you don't think there would be layers upon layers that would write that joke brilliant in a year if you just let him do
*  It and you learn the cushions like he didn't have the cushion you learn Louie people like Louie
*  The great comics are great at learning how to make a hard joke work
*  Yes, and he hadn't maybe developed the cushions yet on stage, but they hadn't done any comedy at all in ten months
*  Yeah, this is like literally the first set he did
*  I think anyone who criticized him about that was the kind of comedian who doesn't take risks because if you take any risk you wouldn't
*  Want stuff to be released right exactly and if you understand how jokes are developed like yeah
*  There's too many people that like got into it from something else and they did stand up in the beginning and then they got into
*  It again
*  They consider themselves stand-ups and then they'll come out and criticize something like this and you could just shut the fuck up man
*  You're not even doing it. Right? You're not this
*  Yeah, you're not even doing it right like you you saying that he's that this is bad like come on, man
*  We this is how everybody creates material you have to yeah once he puts it on a special then you can judge it once he decides
*  But until then yeah work on it, you know, imagine my since joke was filmed
*  I probably probably getting some notoriety back then well now on Twitter you become a hero
*  Yeah, but no one knows about except for me bringing up
*  Except for all your listeners
*  It's like you've got to have a place where you can fuck around and that's the problem with like filming all the time because there's
*  There's things that like you'll start a bit off when you first start writing it and start making it
*  It's so different than when it finishes
*  Yeah, you got to be able to find that and not have people see it
*  Yeah, not have people see it because it's you know comedy is like you want people see the finished product
*  But it's embarrassing until then you're sweating you're working shit out. You're stumbling. You're bombing you like you don't want people see that part
*  Well, it's fun to watch as an audience member though. One of my favorite things is watching a bit develop
*  Yeah, you know watching someone like come up with an initial premise and maybe they come in the green room
*  Brainstorming try to figure what is what what part is where's it get clunky? It's interesting to me
*  It's all a mystery like how it develops like I think about I listen to tapes
*  But when you just keep doing it, it just naturally edits itself. It's an interesting mystery where it naturally forms, right?
*  Right as long as you're not rigid. Yes. Yes and and listen to it all
*  Yeah
*  Because some people are rigid and this is a problem that like open micers have in beginning comics is they
*  Started doing a bit a very certain way
*  So they're kind of comfortable saying it that way and they're uncomfortable on stage already, right?
*  So they keep saying it the same way. That's the death of comedy. Yeah
*  One of the thing Louie taught me
*  All right
*  Tommy something understood but he really articulated is like the enemy of comedy is roteness figuring out that you
*  Once you think you can say it a certain way where it gets a laugh
*  It's dead. Like if you're relying on to just say it that way to right, right, right
*  And he showed he like he made it clear like you really and he's shows it
*  You really got think about the emotion behind it, which you forget immediately
*  yeah after a while but like I
*  Fall into this trap all the time where I figure out a way to say a joke and it gets a laugh
*  Mm-hmm, and I think I think the minute you're a hundred percent sure it's gonna work. That's when it starts dying, right?
*  I know what you're saying
*  Yeah
*  like it has to I think what you're saying is that it has to be real in your mind at that moment you can
*  Be just reading a script you have to fit. Yeah instead of yeah to me. It's like instead of
*  Thinking of like oh, I'm saying something now that we're gonna laugh
*  Just try to think of the anger or the sadness or whatever. Mm-hmm
*  Well, why what is upsetting you are making you laugh hysterically about the subject?
*  That's why bill burr is so great cuz it's like he's not he doesn't look like he's trying to get people
*  Yes, you know you talked to bill in the green room it's the same guy fucking if I fucking told him
*  That's what's hilarious. Just kind of like the fact he's so great at
*  Keeping that anger. I don't know if it's an act. I mean keeping that anger alive through all these shows
*  Bring up something that I know I listen to you fuck
*  You know my favorite is when he's on a podcast with someone and they take themselves seriously
*  Like he was on with Bill Maher and he was just chewing Bill Maher and then he was on Charlemagne the god
*  He was chewing him up. It's just I love it. I love it
*  He's the best at that. Yeah, he's the king. He's amazing. He's the best at like breaking down. Well, yeah, look at you
*  No, he's amazing and he
*  Yeah, I just think his ability to just always be himself on stage, which I think that's the kind of comedy
*  I love the most he has a unique talent for it unique talent for anything. He's talking about. It's just being himself
*  Yeah, no, that's incredible
*  Yeah, it's a fucking it's it's so interesting to see how so many people do it differently
*  But we all have like something in common and I think one thing that everybody has in common is like what the best ones are
*  Really thinking about what they're talking about, right? Right think really really and having to care about it
*  I feel like so many times I'll do a bit and it's not working and then I realize I don't give a shit
*  That's right about the thing. I'm saying I need to if it's important to me will be important to the audience
*  Yeah, I have to bail on bits when I'm bored with them. I know cuz you're like, I don't I don't I don't really care about this
*  Yeah, I know there's something like people look. Yeah, there's something there. I'm like, I know but right now
*  I don't give a fuck about it. So I have to leave it alone for a little bit
*  If you don't give a fuck about it, yeah, they can tell
*  Yeah
*  There's some of them there's some bits that killed when I first started doing them and then they got a little flat and I was
*  Like what is going on here? Oh, I don't care anymore. You don't care. You don't care and you know, they work
*  There's no mystery. Mm-hmm. I also I didn't find out whatever it is in the bit that makes it a great bit
*  Right, you know, there's like there's sometimes you just can't find a thing that elevates it from an eight
*  It stays at an eight exactly and never hits a ten
*  You got it. Sometimes you get a trim sometimes you keep them in if they make a point if they're like
*  bizarrely
*  Ironic right there's something about it. We like it's worth it. Yeah, it's not the funniest joke
*  Yeah, little hills and valleys with with the hour works. Well, yeah. Yeah with an hour, but
*  Sometimes you just got to set it aside and then sometimes I'll come back to it, you know, I have like a
*  Whole folder that I call orphan babies and it's all bits that never made it on anything
*  That's great to keep a record. Yeah, that's a great thing to have to cuz I first part forgetting everything
*  I forget him. Sometimes our friend brings him up
*  What about the hyena thing? I'm like, I fucking forgot. I'm like that. How does it go?
*  People bring that up like oh, yeah, why I stopped doing that joke and I'll do it again. I know it's weird
*  It's tough like I required I did an hour release an hour like a couple months ago
*  And so I'm trying to work out a new hour
*  It's tough when you have that because there's a lot of jokes
*  You just probably don't care about that much, but you need it in there just for the you know, right, right?
*  It's like scaffolding, you know exactly right to keep the bits together. So they're coherent sometimes but in my head. I'm like
*  I think everybody should have a folder that they just put on everybody should write
*  I mean, I know everybody likes to write on stage and I get it and there's some of the greats that write on stage
*  But if you're listening if you're not those people everybody else you should write
*  Yeah, cuz you can go back and not forget that I have a whole my bookshelf looks like seven
*  You know where he has all the notebooks. Yeah
*  It's all just you know crazy manifestos and jokes
*  I think that's it's like one of the things that I found when I had to do this live specials that I had to
*  Really go over my shit. Yeah, like with a fine-tooth comb
*  So I wound up writing out all my bits that I've done hundreds of times write them out
*  Exactly word for word just drill it into my head and then I was preparing for this. I was like I
*  Should probably be doing this all the time
*  Right. I should probably be doing not just when I would get ready for a special but I should probably be doing comedy this way
*  I know it's like whatever I don't done late night. I start really analyzing the jokes
*  Yeah, cutting them and be like, oh I should if I did this all the time, I'd be pretty good
*  I'm like that word does not work there, but it's just cuz I'm doing on late night
*  So I'm like, but then normally I'm like whatever I know it's like it's funny
*  It's we we have our own schedule. We we we get to govern ourselves, which is not always the best thing
*  It's yeah, cuz if we were like a prodigy and you know, you were a violin coach. I would make you practice all day bitch
*  I know but you can only technically practice on stage. That's a weird thing
*  It's like you can but you can prepare off stage. Yeah
*  I
*  Yeah, no
*  I mean
*  I think it's I think it's really important to like write everything down and go back to it and just so you don't lose
*  Anything you can forget things. Yes, especially as you get older
*  I have a bunch of friends that just keep things in their head and you know, like Duncan
*  I'm pretty sure he did this release this bit so I could say he might not have fuck
*  He's got a great bit about my Sid's bit. You can do it
*  No, but I don't know. I think it's like he recorded a special, but I don't know if it's on it
*  So I don't want to say it but okay. He's got this great adderall bit
*  He totally forgot about it. I said
*  Oh my god, that joke's amazing. I got your joke. I got it. You got it. Yeah, it's important to be organized
*  Yeah, we govern ourselves and we're all slackers
*  it's a weird job because it's just you uh-huh, and it's just how it even like advice doesn't typically work because
*  Every comedian when they give advice they're really just giving it that works for them
*  Right and you don't know if it works for your voice or how do you it's all so you're just alone
*  Right you have to create your own
*  System. Yeah advice as long as it's not rigid is really good
*  Because you really can't tell people how to do things. No, and if anything, I mean, there's some good advice
*  I mean when I was started out, I got a couple, you know, yeah look around the audience keep the mic out of that
*  Oh, yeah standard stuff, but like once you get into real advice, I don't know
*  I think it just gets in your head for the most part, you know, sometimes it's good and sometimes it's terrible
*  Yeah, I got a lot of terrible advice when I first started out. What's a good advice good advice is write a lot
*  Listen to your recordings. That was one thing this guy Mike Donovan and but I got real lucky that I started out in Boston in the 80s
*  And it was like there was all these local headliners that were awesome
*  I mean world-class, but they were local and they stayed local and one of the ones this guy Mike Donovan and Mike Donovan
*  He always had a little this is back in the day when he had cassette recorders
*  They were big like like a fucking box of cigars and he would sit it on the thing and press record when he went on stage
*  He goes like you never know he goes you might have a new tagline in that moment
*  That's crazy and then you forget about it if you don't listen and that was some of the best advice I've ever heard
*  He was like the first comic recording of sets. He's just a smart dude and he just figured out that you got to do that
*  Yeah, I think like that advice is great like definitely
*  writing a lot and definitely listen to your sense is so important because
*  There's so many comics who go up all the time
*  But they're delusional and they don't get better because they're not like realizing that it's not working
*  You know, you got to analyze yourself like a hater
*  Exactly, but but stuff about how to say shit and all that I just feel or like your style some of that
*  It's I feel like you're kind of alone a little 100%
*  You know because like imagine someone like bill burr trying to give advice to Mitch Hedberg
*  My mother so many rights
*  At a certain point in time, that's one of the cool I've been thinking about doing this for quite a while now
*  we've talked about and I think we're gonna do it and
*  What I want to do is have
*  Outside of podcast to just have an interview with headliners when they come into town and
*  Tell me about what happened telling about your journey. What was your first open mic?
*  What was it like? Would you how'd you feel? How'd you get started? Did someone influence you to someone ask you to do it?
*  I love what were your first road gigs just not a podcast were like it'd be me talking about my stories
*  But just like I always want to know
*  100% in an interview, right? Right a conversation but an interview and just you know
*  So that it's archived for comics because you remember like when you were starting I mean 17 years ago, right?
*  There you could get a couple of books
*  There was a few books Richard Belzer had a book on stand-up, but it was kind of like tongue-in-cheek
*  The comedy Bible. Yeah, that woman. Yeah
*  There was nothing written by anybody who was really good
*  No, so that was part of the problem not and Belzer was good
*  But yeah, but nothing written by like a George Carlin or Richard Pryor or you know, Lenny Bruce
*  It's never advice from the great it's always some weird person some like kind of grifty. Yeah, it's grifty
*  It's and someone you're like what you're not a comedian
*  Well, we thought about doing that at the store back in the day
*  We were talking about doing comedy classes where you know a comic like a headliner would come in and I know Ari did
*  This quite a few times already did in Phoenix when I was there
*  He'd set up like a seminar for free for all the local comics told them how this is how you get a manager
*  This is how you get an agent. That's how you get stage time
*  This what you should do organize your set and fucking amazing resource for free
*  He did it for like two and a half hours
*  So Ari was doing that for a while, but it's there's nothing like that for comics coming up
*  Everybody has to learn from the people at the clubs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's a good
*  That's a good I would love to hear that if you could go start out now and you can go on YouTube first of all
*  You have access to everything red Fox Rodney changer field fucking everything that's ever been is online
*  Lenny Bruce you watch Lenny Bruce recordings right now. Yeah, it was impossible to find that shit when we started impossible and still impossible understand
*  It was a different time where saying Yiddish was really like hip
*  Well the thing about Lenny was no one had ever talked like that publicly
*  So this was a totally unique thing that you have to take in the context of 1963
*  Some of the most groundbreaking stuff feels the most dated later
*  Yeah, it is so groundbreaking that everyone the model changed the whole world changed the way they think about things and then
*  Talking about things openly the way he did became normal, right? So he's doing normal things to us, but it seems yeah
*  No, it's like that musical Oklahoma seems like such a standard thing. Right at the time was super experimental
*  It was the first one where they they they had like a not a chorus on stage right away or someone singing and a narrative
*  Like a narrative like musicals before that were reviews and you're like I switched it to musicals
*  You like go back to comedy. No musicals are cool
*  I love musicals, but it was like it was groundbreaking at the time right narrative story must ship before that was like reviews
*  And they broke a lot of rules, but now it's just Oklahoma, you know, but it was like an experimental thing at the time
*  like the Wizard of Oz, yeah, the Wizard of Oz was
*  Monumental when I came out like it was something that everybody saw it was one movie that you would guarantee
*  Everybody you talked to had seen the Wizard of Oz. Yeah. No, it was it was it is the most watched movie
*  I read a book about the making recently. It was interesting. Yeah, it did. You know that let's oh
*  Judy Garland was like
*  Groped by a lot of the little people on the movie
*  It's like a whole thing she got groped and I read it apparently they were mad
*  All the little people were like very drunk and wild
*  You know and they were mad because apparently they were getting paid less than Toto the dog
*  Whoa, so the hierarchy on Wizard of Oz was like the dog little people and then women at the bottom
*  You know and they were like groping her and she couldn't say anything about it Wow
*  It's an insane. I wish I could make a man. That's also like what year was that?
*  1939 bro people were savages back then
*  Oh
*  He slapped the director Victor Fleming slapped Judy Garland the face during a scene just slapped her because she couldn't
*  Keep a straight face. Oh my god
*  Oh, no, it was and that movie I wish I could make a movie about the making of Wizard of Oz and that would show
*  Like the beauty of the movie but also how horrible behind the scenes were right because you had the witch
*  caught on fire and
*  Literally like lost feeling in her hand at one point and then they forced her to go back to Margaret
*  What her name is they first should go back to work the next day even this year's in the hospital
*  The original guy playing the Tin Man got really sick
*  Because of the the paint they were using he ended up in the hospital. They just replaced him
*  Yeah, he got like really sick. Yeah, no, it's like a it was that oh that makes sense
*  Like what the fuck is that stuff they put on his skin? There's no regulation
*  Just like let's try this they just got done with like think about that was like the litamide babies back then
*  Yeah, but that was actually later the litamide babies wasn't that like in the 60s
*  But they had the the the girls that developed cancer because they were using the loom for the watches, right?
*  Right, right. So that radio at was that that's a radium girls radium girls
*  Yeah, there was horrific holes in their face and shit. Their tongues would rot out of their mouths. It was zero
*  Nobody told him anything cuz it was like the tip of their brush when they were because they were doing these very delicate
*  Yeah, dials on watches know that no one gave a shit and the Hollywood there was no like the stars didn't have like
*  Some stars were beginning to have power but Judy Garland. She was just treated like like she was owned by them
*  You know, I mean, right like to slap
*  Imagine the director likes try to slap like Emma Stone now
*  It's just crazy to think that that wasn't that long ago. I know and it's well the Holocaust also
*  Kind of like
*  Watching tape and listening to tape as a comic because you don't know how bad you suck
*  You see it and people didn't know how bad like that kind of behavior was until you see it
*  Like go to what the old James Cagney movies. He'd smack his girlfriend right in the face and he was the hero and then they kiss each other
*  It's all yeah every night. It's yeah
*  I love watching old stuff to see like the the problematic parts
*  You see the one where it's like an old Western and the guy is spanking his wife and the kid comes along and
*  Says do you like I know why you're spanking mommy. It's because you love her and he's like, that's right son
*  It's so nuts like the woman is over the guy's knees
*  And he's spanking her that's it's out of love, you know
*  Yes, this is like something that someone thought you could pass off in a movie
*  That's how confused we were about narratives and about reality and well every 80s movie like people like you gotta watch it is
*  This is not the one where the guy the wife I mean he's beating her with a piece of metal and what a great show
*  What a great movie I love what they give him the weapon to you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, like normal
*  Yeah, normal beat her with a weapon. Don't use your hand. What if your hand gets hurt? Well every 80s movie
*  They're like you got to watch this 80s movie. It's a classic that he turned on
*  It's like 12 nerds gang raping a woman. It's like every 80s comedy is like a prank. Is this the what is this one?
*  And he spanks her too, so he's carrying her away look he's spanking her in front of everybody look at the
*  This is so crazy. That's not just spanking was spanking in public
*  Not just like he's holding her up in the air while he's in there laughing like they think it's wonderful. Look
*  He's gonna fuck her lady
*  I've never been so
*  I
*  Have black eyes
*  And he's got his arm around her. Oh, sweetie. I got the job
*  What the fuck is that movie about you?
*  We just look evil when we look back in the past and we're just like slap
*  Spankers banker and by the way, they thought they were so sophisticated because they were comparing themselves to fucking cave people
*  Of course. Yeah, well, we you know, we change we move at our own pace
*  Right, and so we had to like look at the cave pain
*  That is kind of fucked up you stabbed that guy with a spear
*  That to movies and plays right yeah, well we're getting we're getting better
*  It's just well, I like my cousin had a bat mitzvah
*  It is reformed
*  You know that's where you do the whole service in English and you have to read part of the Bible
*  Which in reform and conservative you do in Hebrew, but in reform you do in English. What is it? What is it?
*  Why reform they're just more liberal more accessible. It's usually like a lesbian rabbi
*  Like eating on her girlfriend on stage
*  And there's like a the Cantor's tuning a guitar and she had to read a part of the Bible
*  But reform do it in English
*  so the 13 year old girl had to go on stage in front of everyone and read the selected part and
*  Like not every part of the Bible holds up
*  So she was like 300 people her parents behind her and she's just on stage. She has to open to the part and she's just like
*  When a slave offends you you cut off his right arm and then his parents her parents are behind her like that's my girl
*  And then she's like what you offend them again you execute them. These are the laws
*  How to punish your slaves and we're all just like in the back. I'm is that real quote. Yeah or something like that
*  Yeah, something close to that. Yes Christ and that's why you do it in Hebrews. You don't have to
*  You don't know what they're talking about
*  Well, that was the whole thing about them doing it in Latin right?
*  Like nobody can speak Latin so they could take the priest's word for it says give me a hundred dollars if you want to be in
*  the afterlife
*  There's a lot of that going on that's why everybody wanted to kill Martin Luther, right, right?
*  Yeah, the Latin that was a that was a big con huge con. Yeah, nobody speaks it
*  Yeah, only we know what it's saying. It's the priest's like kid
*  It's saying to suck my dick right now
*  It's nuts isn't it not as a that is kind of a dead language like you can still learn Latin, but nobody speaks Latin
*  No, unless you're getting possessed by the devil. Yeah
*  Don't forget that demographic
*  Well, they usually to tuck in tongues they're not even doing Latin they're going
*  Do they occasionally I feel like the exorcist I feel like she throws in a little land
*  She said your mother sucks cocks in hell, which by the way, that's English
*  I don't understand why anyone's scared of that movie that movies hilarious. That's because you're younger than I know when I was a boy
*  That movie was fucking terrifying. I saw that movie
*  I was real young like I probably shouldn't have been able to see it like what what year did that movie come out 70?
*  five
*  73 okay tried to be rain man. So six. Yeah
*  Yeah, my parents let me see all the scary movies
*  Okay, can I ask you this did you at the time I was trying them about it back stage
*  Did you did you believe in the devil a kind of oh, yeah, sure cuz I'm a Jew
*  I'm like a heathen Jew, right? We don't believe in the devil. So for me, it just felt like funny
*  It's good fucking movie, man
*  But it's just like she's like you saying like your mom sucks cocks in hell. That's like to a priest
*  That's definitively funny. Well, how about when she fucks herself at the cross? I just don't I don't know
*  It's just like she said some real wild shit while she was doing it to like
*  Something like that, but that's like I guess back then the idea of a kid cursing was like, oh, it's crazy
*  Well this good now itself bark you want to talk about someone that got fucked up from doing a movie
*  Really fucked up from doing these imagine, okay, you're a young girl and you are literally playing the devil
*  Everybody knows you you're famous now and you're famous for being the fucking devil. That's insane. So everywhere you go people are scared of you
*  People see on the street you fucked yourself with a crucifix in a movie 13 people are walking by
*  Cocks in hell. She probably never heard the end of it and that was another movie that everybody saw
*  Yeah, that was a yeah, I just I love horror movies, but I find that one it's like I just don't find it
*  I know I feel like a girl. I mean at the time I get it was scary. Definitely if you're six
*  But I just find it silly. It's just like you're telling the priest go fuck himself. This is funny
*  I get it
*  But I think it's because we are living in 2024 where he's in snap and all those movies have gone on and we've learned from
*  Which is interesting to think that like back then a kid cursing we were so much more puritanical that was like
*  Disturbing disturbing and now it's South Park. Yeah, it's totally normal. Yeah now they're sticking things up their butts
*  Yeah in cartoons. Yeah, it's totally normal now and that's again
*  It's like going back to listen to Lenny Bruce stuff and then trying to listen to he had one joke that
*  Comics inadvertently stole because they didn't realize that they were stealing it
*  But because it was so so brilliant, but it was when homosexuality was illegal back then right and he goes being gay is
*  Illegal dig what what do they do when they catch you? They put you in jail with a bunch of guys
*  We want to have sex with you
*  This is a great job. Yeah, great jokes. It's it's just
*  You don't we we can't if you went back in time to the 1950s and talked to people they would think you're a fucking
*  Alien like who is this guy? How's he talking so freely about things right right and he did have great joke
*  He's gonna get past that you dig and yeah, I'm sure the nose but like
*  He had great joke. I read that book of his is awesome the one of his transcripts you look at that
*  No, it's like just that right the trials. No just of the stand. Oh the stand. It's awesome
*  You see it all in like you had one bit that was like I love Bill Hicks
*  He's one of my favorites, but it was similar to Bill Hicks joke not to say Bill Hicks stole from it
*  but they're just great minds think alike about like
*  If Jesus came back to you, what do you want to see across something similar? Yeah
*  And a bunch of guys had that yeah, but he might have been the first. Yeah, he probably was the first
*  I mean
*  Kenison had something kind of similar to that too. I listened to Bill Hicks recently. He got me into comedy
*  I always loved him
*  I listened to him on a road trip recently and he holds up so well and I think like the people call him preachy
*  I think they're so wrong. I don't I actually think all his jokes are just good jokes
*  That aren't really preachy for the most part. See, I don't think it was preachy like
*  Like I don't think Anthony Jessel neck is really offensive
*  No, you know I'm saying like it's a style of comedy if his style of comedy was condescending
*  I'm smarter than you and here's some amazing points right about life. And so I liked it
*  I like that. Yeah Hicks like when Hicks had talked about things you talk about things like, you know, everybody's stupid
*  Like this is why right and I'm telling you how it should be and that's what people didn't like about it
*  But that was also a great way to get some of those points across
*  Like there was some points that that's really kind of the only way if you want to deliver it the way he does it
*  It's really kind of the only way you can do it
*  Well, it's also funny to see a crazy person on stage just someone who's like, you know, that's hilarious. Like he is a funny
*  Character and I do think he has great
*  Mr. X like just great jokes that go beyond like what ideology he's like, you know professing, you know, I mean Hicks Hicks
*  Yeah, well, he had
*  Brilliant shit about the war. I mean, yeah, they have sophisticated weapons. How do you know we check the receipts
*  Well the whole like
*  Book depository is very realistic. Yeah
*  He just had great like I just thought he had just kind of like Woody Allen
*  I know he loved Woody Allen like great like Mr. X
*  Mm-hmm
*  and when you listen to it now a lot of it is kind of what a lot of good comedy is where you take
*  A hot-button issue, but then you then you just have a joke. That's just kind of about something else
*  Right, right, right. That's really a lot of what his stuff is. It just feels like kind of like modern comedy. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, well, he definitely changed a lot of people's idea of comedy because he made it kind of interesting for the first time
*  He had interesting subjects him and Doug stand-up definitely were my big influences. I loved you too. I loved your old I loved your
*  I don't know listen back when I listen to comedy albums. That was a different era. I guess you know, oh wow
*  Yeah, but I remember I loved your bit about the tiger in the zoo. Oh, yeah box
*  Yeah, I still think about that every time in a zoo cuz they always make the cage look like they could possibly jump out
*  Yeah, you know you're on that bit
*  Yeah, I do a kind of remember it
*  But I remember the story these kids threw pinecones at a tiger and the the Tigers can jump 14 feet in a 12 foot
*  Okay
*  Just secure unless a tiger gets really mad
*  But when's that gonna happen just I would have given everything to see the look on their face and that thing touched the top
*  Of the bars. Yeah, they were like when the paws hit the bars and the body starts going over the flood
*  Chemicals that was going to your mind that's a high
*  Off the charts that's a high probably like nothing else you'll ever experience in life cold plunge times 10,000
*  It's like undeniable you're dying right now. I guess coming for you. It's a 600 pound super predator
*  What could survive right? I think one could survive. I think the kid who threw the pinecones unfortunately survived
*  I think his buddy got taken out. Oh, that's how fierce tigers are. I'm not gonna fuck you up
*  I'm gonna fuck your friend up. I think his buddy went to help him. Oh my god. I don't know the whole story
*  I mean who knows it was probably just
*  Chaos, but I think about that bit every time at a zoo. They always make it look like the tire you can jump out
*  I'm like, why don't you why don't you just not make it look like that put a roof on the monster on the box?
*  Have a roof on the box
*  Monster the city
*  Look like you can jump out we don't need also how expensive is it to put a roof on nice?
*  It's that expensive. I think they want to make it feel like it's free. Fuck that. It's not free. No
*  Yeah, they shouldn't be there. I don't I don't agree with zoos at all
*  You know like no
*  I know I used to I'm a hypocrite because I took my kids to them because I want my kids to be able to see
*  These animals because it's kind of cool to see a two-year-old staring at a hippo. Well, yeah
*  But the reality is they're prisons. They're prisons for animals. It didn't do anything wrong, but
*  It's a little different in the sense that
*  Their life outside of prison is pretty messed up the bread. It's natural. It is natural
*  They're not all getting killed, you know, they're doing some killing too
*  Which is also unnatural that you just feed these things that live to kill. I guess the zoo is better for the prey
*  Why I used to have a joke about that too about the only
*  Animal that I don't feel bad about the zoo is giraffes. They're having a great time
*  They don't seem to have any problem with it at all. They got another day with no lions
*  Well, it's like yeah
*  If that's jail like freedom of them just getting chased by like if you if you were in prison outside of prison
*  You could just get eaten anytime. Yeah, prison wouldn't look so bad
*  Well, as long as they have a big enough enclosure and they can walk around they don't seem to have any problem with it
*  Yeah
*  It sucks for the predators because they can't like hunt
*  Exactly, and then they always put the tiger like next to the giraffe or the lion just to fuck with them
*  Which is so crazy. It's a little cruel. You imagine being a tiger and you're like I
*  Forget cuz you have bad memories
*  Cock suckers, yeah, they they're kind of cruel with that put them in different places. Well, you shouldn't put them there at all
*  Yeah, it's great. The whole thing's crazy. Yeah, I get it does protect some endangered species
*  But boy, I think if we really care about animals
*  We should put a lot more money into it and there should be a lot larger spaces
*  And it shouldn't be anything remotely resembling a zoo and it's always weird who gets the big space
*  Yeah, the Louisville Zoo like there's a wolf who just got like fucking like 12 acres and then a snow leopards like
*  Like a little diorama with a cage on it
*  It's sick
*  The way they do it in Africa is the way to do it if you really want to go see an animal should go on
*  A fucking safari and drive through these areas where they're killing gazelles and they're doing normal lion shit
*  This is a normal lion in a lion environment and you drive through it and it's probably dangerous shit
*  Yeah, and keep your fucking windows roll
*  You know that lady from the Game of Thrones one of the
*  One of the video I think one of the video editors one of the editors from the Game of Thrones got killed
*  By a lion in one of those parks in the safari
*  She rolled her window down and she was leaning out to take a photo or something the cat reached in grabbed her
*  Oh my god
*  I saw one of those videos where the people in the car and like that one of them
*  I think it's a tiger not a tiger Africa
*  But it was a lion coming up to the car and they're looking at it in the line just open the door
*  Put the door open
*  Lock the door man
*  Imagine a little skinny ass piece of window that you could put your head through easy
*  Yeah, and there's a lion right outside of it. You can put his head through it easily. Yeah, you know, no
*  Yeah, but if he just fucking smashes his head, it'll go right through that thing. He's a lion
*  He's just like crazy that day if he just decides to pop it with his paw. It's just gonna burst
*  Well, that's what's crazy about the tiger who killed the kid. It's like they were like
*  He can't get out unless he's really wants to it's like don't
*  Protect it from him really wanting to as well. They didn't have the proper height fence
*  Yeah, yeah, they not only do they not have a roof on it
*  The fence was two feet shy of what a tiger can jump over
*  three-foot wall, what I
*  Think over a three-foot wall and out of its enclosure. No, no, no, no, no, no
*  They might have misunderstood when they wrote this article, but that's what this I don't think that
*  That's correct. I'm almost
*  I'm almost positive that it was 14 feet long
*  Oh, the wall was 1.2 meters 4 feet shorter than the recommended minimum, but it was it was more than 3 feet
*  I think it was 12 feet hilarious was actually 3 feet. And then what's the problem? That's crazy. That's 4 foot shy
*  I'm reading multiple articles. This one is even this was also weird. I thought it happened in 2011
*  This says it was 2008. So I'm kind of confused on that too. Mmm
*  Maybe it's more than one of those this was the same person that died in both articles. Oh how weird they're trying to say
*  They were on drugs. It's like the guys were doesn't mean they die and die one meet three-foot wall. That's so crazy
*  I could jump a three-foot wall. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's not real. I could try
*  Try yeah, you could probably at least get over the top of it. There's no way it was that's no there's no what that's this tall
*  That's crazy. That would be hilarious. I'm just made it three feet
*  They're like he doesn't you know from the San Francisco newspaper, what does that one say picture of what it was?
*  wall
*  Bro, that's pretty high
*  Says oh the new glass wall makes it 19 feet
*  But it looks her wall used to be 12 feet
*  So that's where it was and the tiger jumped over that and now they gave him an extra of five feet
*  Fuck that place. But look how it's higher seven have made that jump on the distance. They said it was too far
*  It looks like it's built to have that tiger jump off that top part onto the thing
*  It's like it's built so he can jump out
*  Did they say the tiger jump from the bottom or the tiger jump from that top part the articles?
*  I was reading when it first happened. They weren't sure what the fuck happened. They were like, it doesn't make sense that it happened
*  They're like someone must have helped it. What that's them covering their ass
*  Yeah, it is a little bit of that cuz that's them covering their ass. They know exactly what happened
*  There was eyewitnesses people saw it happen. Also who could have helped it. Yeah
*  So that's what it looked like
*  Oh my god, imagine that thing coming over the top of that
*  That's the three foot fence. I think that they were saying exactly wait
*  So if the pie if they're throwing pine is this the pine cone thing?
*  Yeah, yeah, so that it had to be below if they're throwing pine cones
*  No, it could be over there. They could throw it over the ridge. You think it got all the way to them
*  Yeah, yeah, you could throw that that's not that far. No, no, no, no, no
*  That looks like 15 yards max. Let me see that again. Let me see that photo again. Yeah, that doesn't look that far, dude
*  It's a big jump though. I guess you can it's probably a big jump for a cat
*  I don't know if you made the jump. I think you made the jump from the bottom
*  That's yeah
*  The argued that the one that was confusing said that it was basically in these bushes when they fucking when they were standing on this
*  Rail throwing shit at it and then they got too close and found out like there was one way closer than they thought
*  That's not what I heard. I know I know it doesn't make sense
*  I don't know that what I had heard was the thing was over there
*  They were continuing to throw things at it and it came towards them and jumped over the wall
*  Which only makes sense ray? Oh eyewitness accounts statements from the time. Here's already my confusion
*  This is from 2011 and those last two articles were 2008
*  Hmm. Well, maybe they didn't release the whole story until 2011
*  Yeah, there it is. Okay, so the lawsuit. Yeah, they should fucking sue for sure
*  I mean definitely you shouldn't throw pinecones at Tigers, but I just have to die your fucking kid
*  You're a dumbass kid that could have been us if we were both 17 and I go I do dare you to throw a pinecone
*  Come on pussy. Just a pinecone from the bottom of the moat and to the dry moat to the top of the wall Wow
*  No, that's crazy from the bottom of the dry moat so they got into the bottom of yeah like I thought
*  The bottom of the kid imagine jumping out unless it was provoked yeah, but it shouldn't be able to jump out if it's provoked
*  Yeah, that's so shit lazy. You should have a backup plan for the Tigers emotions
*  Yeah
*  Also, why don't you have guards to make sure that someone doesn't do something the tiger can't get out as long as it's the Tigers chill
*  Wow followed someone's blood trail for about 300 yards where resumed attacks. Oh my god
*  Photo show blood smeared asphalt where the tiger apparently dragged Sosa's body it found the blood trail
*  The tiger would leave a kill to go after something else unless we're a compelling reason. Oh my god another victim blaming
*  It's a tiger past exhibits with warthogs
*  Which is ignored as it followed the blood trail of the two brothers to the Terrace Cafe outside the dining area
*  This is a real. What are they wearing? What were they? Yes? You know I mean that's exactly what it is
*  They were high or like what a black person get to kill and they try to vilify the black guy
*  They're like he was on drugs. It's kind of like that. They're like he was high
*  He was they should have provoked it
*  But it's like you should have a cage where a tiger can't get out on any mood the Tigers. Yeah, whether he's happy or mad
*  They should test every mood. Yeah, let's see if he could jump out in any of the moods
*  Also, what if it killed some old lady it was just there with her her niece
*  Yeah, you know showing her around and what if you know who the fuck knows what could have happened you're just guessing and it
*  Didn't even kill the friend. It didn't even kill the guy killed the other guy
*  I don't know who it killed now. I'm saying that I'm trying to remember, but I bet it killed
*  I killed the younger of the three the other two were brothers that were not killed
*  Who was the one that threw the pine cones were they all thrown?
*  I thought I haven't found out it sucks that they'd know that that tiger was like maybe they were all throwing pine cones
*  Maybe I heard the story wrong or the tiger was just clearly more annoyed by one of them like one of them had a more annoying
*  Thing it's whoever the fuck is closest. Yeah. Yeah, who's closest?
*  Who's who's gonna get taken out first this thing has never had a chance to take out anything? Yeah, it's a little
*  I mean the whole reason they exist is they are the cleanup crew for nature
*  Anything that has a limp and anything that does something stupid you go walking through the thick grass. That's a wrap
*  That's what they're there for that. They're there for overpopulation. Yeah, because they exist around deer
*  Yeah, of course they exist around a very specific kind of deer it's called an axis deer and these deer move like lightning dude
*  Yeah, you ever see the axis deer. No, I don't think so
*  They fucking chow they take off like it's crazy because they evolved around tigers, right?
*  So they they just explode away so fast the lot of time you see those water buffalo moving
*  They seem to completely forget about tigers or lions until they jump out and then they're like, oh shit
*  And then they all run away not that many lions eat water buffaloes. No, they're so big. They're too dangerous
*  You can get a broken jaw broken leg. They stomp your head. You're dead
*  But yeah, I agree that predators it sucks for them in the zoo
*  But you never want to have a zoo is just pray that would kind of suck
*  Reported that her claws were not frayed suggesting that she made the 12 foot 9 inch leap on her first attempt. Oh my god
*  Dr. Dunker also reported that there was no disease or signs of trauma on the body other than bullet wounds for the for the cat
*  Jesus Christ. Do you know there's a one specific
*  Tribe of lions in Africa that does hunt water buffalo. Yeah, because they get stranded on an island
*  Oh, the the currents change to this river and these lions got stranded on this island that only has water buffalo
*  Oh, and so the female lions evolved to become much larger than normal female lions. They look like Hulk lions. It's crazy
*  It's called relentless enemies. They're the hunters of females. Yes, the females are hunters
*  So they got as big as male lions. So the female hunters are as jet
*  Jack too like they look freakish because they have to take out water buffalo all the time
*  Have you seen the video the best nature video?
*  I mean it's the one about the water buffalo is walking and the lion comes and they like it's like four lines and they
*  Never go after the big one. It's always like four of them after like a baby water beller, right?
*  a wheelchair
*  it's like yeah, and they push him into the water and then a crocodile comes out of the water and grabs a water buffalo the
*  baby and then the
*  The lines are like having a tug-of-war with like the crocodile it's like insane
*  But that's the crocodiles of the ultimate cleanup crew
*  Yeah
*  You see we can find that relentless enemies thing because you should get to see what these female lions look like
*  Right just show it to us because these female lions they don't even look real they look like CGI lions
*  They're super jacked. So the female lions are normally smaller, but they are the hunter. They're the hunters
*  But this this documentary relentless and see we find one of the images of the jack look at who she's built like she's
*  She's built like a male. That's insane. She's fucking huge
*  Huge because they have to take out water buffalos like a female bodybuilder. It's a great documentary though
*  It's because it's just about nature adapting right the size of her. Oh my god. There's so much bigger and
*  You know, they have to be because these fucking things are ruthless. I mean water buffalo are huge
*  Yeah, they're tough as shit you can hang off and with their claws and they don't even notice it. Yeah
*  Those have like bugs on them. They don't notice like yeah fucking shit life
*  Have you done some far? No my buddy McCabe damn. I gave my friend
*  He did it and he sent me a footage of a lion like killing a like a prey right in front of them
*  Yeah, he just filmed it. Yes, and they're in those open Jeeps. Yeah
*  Yeah, well that shit up. What is that about?
*  Haven't figured out yet that they can get you people love it's like the zoo. They love to have it all open
*  They love to just like, you know push it as far as they can, bro
*  I want to be an Iron Man suit with a chainmail gun. Yeah one of those chain gun. I
*  Do not want to like I said Iron Man suit like it's a thing
*  Iron Man suits what happened
*  Power went out
*  Is the video recording
*  The video is the only thing recording yeah, can we keep going or should we stop? Oh there it goes again
*  It's the hottest day of the year. I have a problem with the AC
*  Overpowered, but yeah, I mean I'll turn everything back on. It's today the hottest day of the year so far
*  Yeah, it's gonna be a hundred and seven. Oh god
*  We're still recording really. Yeah, the cameras shut off and on to though the I don't know to tell you
*  Screen still on cameras are still on
*  Time still going how hot is it today?
*  God didn't feel like it the you ever be on a club with the light
*  We might want to stop for like five minutes to make sure this doesn't keep happening while we have the opportunity before it fucks up
*  More, I don't know your call, but it's recording right? Yeah, but if it's flickered four or five times
*  Right, what could possibly happen? It stops recording
*  Flickered again like well we have a chance for it to stop might want to take a break. That's all okay
*  We'll take a little pee break. We'll come back ladies and gentlemen and non-binary folks
*  Now we're up oh, we're just about to complain about the government or whoever it is they're cracking down on our controversial takes
*  Yeah lines
*  They're trying to ban free speech man
*  To get everybody else's power up out
*  Okay
*  Is it a brownout is this one of them brownouts?
*  Texas says it's on grid which is great until it's not
*  Yeah, it got real close
*  Apparently during the cold front it got real close. They were like 30 minutes away from losing the whole grid
*  No, my friend was my best friend from here Zach and he he was here during the when they had to like what melt the snow
*  Whatever the you know, what if he just became like it was crazy crazy survival thing. That was the first year
*  We lived here. No one knows how to drive in the snow. It was hilarious. Yeah
*  People with Corvettes like spinning around in intersections
*  No, he was melting snow. Why was he melting like they had to melt snow for something. It was for what I don't know
*  Like the
*  Movie alive water the melted snow for water for water. Yeah, I think the yeah pipes froze. Yeah
*  Yeah, that makes sense. It was crazy. Yeah. Yeah, you gotta have some water folks. Yeah some water in your house. It's good move
*  Yeah, if you if you're in a place that that happens like that and they so like if this happens in Boston
*  They know how to deal with snowy roads and they fix things. Yeah easy the plow, you know
*  Everything back online anytime there's snow it all shuts down for they don't have plows like hey guys
*  I've been here twice and it snowed. How about buy a fucking plow?
*  You know have one. Yeah. Yeah, I guess it just haven't happened enough for them to you know, yeah, but that's so stupid
*  Yeah, no, I know Louisville's I'm from Louisville, Kentucky
*  It's kind of like that too whenever it snowed it shut down the whole city
*  It's funny if you grow up in a place like I grew up in Boston, which is like snow is just
*  Just normal it's part of up snowing out did you even have like did school ever close it had a fucking snow
*  So that you miss school to close like
*  Closing school was such a fun. Oh, yeah
*  No, no every time we did have them we did have snow days. Yes, you did fucking
*  But in places like there if it just snowing a little they let you go to school go to school
*  But was there anything better than a snow day?
*  I
*  Think I learned more in snow days than I did in any other day worse and then you'd be at you'd be like watching the TV
*  Waiting for County to be listed. Yeah
*  Please I could stay home watch cartoons, please
*  No, it was wonderful and now the snow sucks you hate it someone should redesign school school's terrible
*  Yeah, it's just the whole design of getting kids to sit down all day. It's fucking terrible
*  We wake them up at like farmer times
*  I used to get up at like five in the morning like I was a farmer
*  Yeah, and your parents would just go back to bed
*  They're like we don't go they just get up and then they go back to sleep
*  I'd be on the bus at like five in the morning or said terrible for kids and then they say we have ADD
*  We're fucking tired. Yeah tired and bored. Yeah, and this shows this thing you're doing in front of me sucks
*  I got back to the adderall thing. So I got addicted and I ended up
*  What did you start off with? How much are you taking in the beginning? I think probably like 30 milligrams right away
*  Yeah, whoa, I think maybe you said 20 kept you up for two days
*  I'm not a user but 20 was point. I said user like that. I'm not a user like this junkie
*  I'm not a user. I
*  Got started off with 30s. Yeah, I started taking it every day or yeah right away
*  Yeah, recreationally first recreationally then I got the prescription. So was FDA approved. So he did listen to psychiatrists
*  She is a doctor. Yes, but then I started taking more and having to buy them off the street and
*  then I
*  At one point I couldn't get any and I this kid I knew this kind of bad seed
*  I asked him if he had any he had like something he said his uncle made it was like a synthetic drug
*  Turned out to be bath salts. I ended up taking them. I was a
*  greeter at a
*  H&R block, you know the tax place and I just like basically had this horrible panic meltdown
*  Like I like it kicked in and I just thought I was about to die. I recall my twin sister
*  I freaked her out. I was like, I think I'm about to die
*  Goodbye that I hung up and then she called back and she was like call the ambulance. They called the ambulance
*  My heart rate was that like a hundred and like I don't know probably what yours is when you're exercising but it was faster
*  Probably was normal. There was like 190 like oh my god, and yeah, I totally redlining. It was crazy
*  Yeah, I almost died and then I ended up going to rehab for Adderall which is kind of embarrassing
*  How hard was it to kick?
*  You know, I weaned off which was if you wean off. I think it's okay cold turkey is not for me
*  So what did you you said you were up to 90 a day. So how'd you wean? You know, it's just 80
*  Really? I think something like that. Yeah, so were you completely functional when you were on it or were you out of your mind?
*  No, I was functional. I was annoying. That was the thing. I was annoying. Oh, you couldn't stop talking
*  Yeah, I got really annoying and
*  That it ended up like people just that's the thing people think drugs will you know?
*  I'm not like a crazy person, but I just annoyed everyone right and so the intervention was more like you're really annoying you talk non-stop
*  And then I got off it was kind of the same
*  Wasn't that different I'm like no, that's just me and you're a lot of work. It's actually a perk. Yeah, exactly
*  It's actually a plus but I miss it. I mean, I don't I could never
*  I miss it. It was a great it's it was my favorite drug. It made you cuz I have you know
*  I'm like everyone I have low self-esteem and when he did it it made me it made me just right
*  I just was so productive on it really. Yeah, cuz it when I write
*  I mean, I've gotten better at it now over the years
*  But when I write you have that voice telling you it's shit and you can't like move forward
*  And and this the adderall like this was before I was I was doing stand-up a little but writing screenplays and stuff
*  And the adderall gave me the confidence to just fucking plow through it
*  It wasn't all good. But some of those good. Mmm, you know
*  Well, I mean that's why they were prescribing it to people back in the day when they first came up with it like in Nazi
*  Germany even before they were giving it to the Nazis you could buy that what was it called per what is it called per per?
*  pervading
*  pervitin pervitin that's Hitler speed. Well, it was the it was the
*  For-sale version of methamphetamine that you could buy at drugstores. Yeah, and people would just take it
*  It was like a low dose. It's essentially just like that's it right there
*  Kind of real similar to adderall in a lot of ways
*  But it was a you know, it was methamphetamine. Oh, right. You just could take it. This is like over-the-counter, right?
*  Yeah back when they had like heroin that methamphetamine hydrochloride. Oh man
*  That's crazy. So it was a small dose and people would take it all day long and it gave them all this energy to get things
*  Done. I mean think about the engineering that was coming out of Germany at the same time. Yeah, I had a nuts
*  They were focused. They were fucking dialed in. He was really focused on that. Jew hating that
*  That's been really focused. Yeah, he wasn't on a probably wouldn't killed as many people
*  Well, if it wasn't on everything he was an oxycodone and they were giving him all these crazy animal
*  Hormones he was having them remove animal organs and they were injecting glands into Hitler's body
*  He was like they were practicing on but here's here's what I don't get I've done oxycodone and when I'm on it
*  I'm very loving I love everyone. Mmm. He was on it and he was still hating it
*  If that is like he should have been like I love the juice or create like the oxycodone should have made him like more
*  Lovey-dovey. Yeah, that's why I was confused too
*  because I had always heard that it was meth because I knew that there was meth use and I knew that Hitler like cocaine and
*  They used to shoot him up with testosterone too. And that makes sense. That makes sense. You're a meth
*  We got a problem. Yeah, I'm focused. I'm gonna give it to it. But the oxy it's like when Rush Limbaugh you found out
*  He was on oxy. He was always so like angry, right?
*  I'd be like everything's gonna work out. He was on like 90 pills a day
*  But we're like the love did so much they think it's part of the reason why he went deaf really? Yeah rush
*  Yeah, there's actually like a thing that happens when you overdose
*  I'm too too much opiates it fries your fucking ears
*  Like to have all that hate on my painkillers, I just don't get when I'm on painkillers. I love my enemies
*  I think it's cuz you're a nice guy. Oh
*  Like that spin I think I think who you are like at your core like why you operate in life
*  Whatever you're taking whether it's alcohol or pot or whatever. It only enhances that who you are at your core
*  So if you're like an evil person deep down but you're covering it and then you get drunk and you get really vicious with people
*  Those people are probably already vicious inside of them, right?
*  Yeah, that's that's totally if you're a happy drunk
*  You're probably a good guy and you need a couple of drinks to feel loose and now you're fun
*  You're having a good time. You know, you're loving you're hugging everybody. No, that's a good point
*  It's like what I used to drink. I would like tell people I love them now. I'm sober. I don't tell anyone
*  Sober I just I'm more sober, right?
*  Just like rigid that was the benefit of some drugs is that they allow you to relax whatever
*  Insecurities you have and just be cool with people. So my girlfriend
*  Speaking of drugs, she's on like serious blood thinners because she just had a stroke. Oh Jesus Christ
*  How old is she like a couple weeks ago? She's 85
*  I know she so when we started dating
*  To you two and a half years ago. She had she was about to get open heart surgery
*  Yeah, like she told me that on our first date, oh my god, yeah
*  This is like something she's born with it was a congenital heart thing mitral valve. Mm-hmm
*  She had a mitral valve leak. Oh Jesus and she found it out. She's 37 and so four months into our dating
*  She got open heart surgery. Oh my god. Yeah, and then everything was going well
*  And then like this is like this month like I don't even maybe a month ago
*  I'm gonna see a screening of my friend's movie this really great comic Isabella Hagan had funded her own movie
*  I'm gonna see it. We're gonna meet and she calls me and she says her she can't see out of her left eye
*  She's on the subway and we had to like call an ambulance and like rush to the hospital
*  And like the crazy thing is the ambulance did not take us right away
*  Like we got in there and they like had to make her fill out her insurance. Oh my god for like 20 minutes
*  Oh my god, that's great with one eye with one. Oh my god. Yeah, so crazy
*  I thought an ambulance just goes I thought they'd go to they were like getting the insurance. She's like dying
*  They're like, what's your group member ID number? Oh my god, and then they finally went and there was no siren
*  We just had the ambulance without the siren
*  Which was good pointless, you know
*  So ambulance in traffic ambulance in traffic we get to this like ER type place
*  They think she's having a stroke and we had like a person on TV. It was like black mirror
*  They got like some neurologist who was like on vacation
*  She just they brought the TV in like a like a TV and she was on the video
*  The camera was moving around the room looking at people was so bizarre and she said if it's a stroke
*  She had to go on like really intense
*  like blood thinners for the day and
*  That they were so intense that she even bumped her head. She could get bleeding in the brain
*  So I like observe her for like a day on these really like she couldn't go anywhere
*  Because if she she bled so easily on these blood thinners, right she said stay put yeah
*  So they gave it to her. She started bleeding out of her mouth
*  Oh, she had like a cut in her mouth. She's like smiling like blood coming out of her mouth. And and then and
*  Then the craziest part is so they had to take her to the ICU to observe her but we weren't at an ICU
*  We had like an ER that didn't have people stay the night
*  So we had to even though she was on these blood thinners because you had to go on them for four hours
*  To put her in an ambulance in the rain
*  And we had to drive to a place where she couldn't move for a day because she could get if she got hit
*  Oh, my god on the glass. Oh my god insane
*  Yeah, it was insane
*  The lot of problem with like EMTs and people like that
*  It's not a problem, but it's part of the job as they get really accustomed to people being fucked up and dying
*  I know they have they didn't seem to be that urgent. It's kind of crazy
*  Like I've talked to friends that worked as EMTs and they have the most morose senses of humor
*  Yeah, they're so used to people dying and they tell you story. They all have PTSD. They're all right
*  They all get the gunshot wounds and you know, they all see the worst shit car accidents the worst shit motorcycle crashes for us
*  It was like a huge emergency, but for them, it's just a stroke
*  Her hands intact whatever
*  So crazy she lost she doesn't she can't get it back. She has like a blind spotter right now. Oh my god
*  Yeah, no way. It's coming back or she's gotten used to seeing out both eyes, but when she closes one eye
*  There's like this it's like your forehead would be like a little whited out. No, I don't think it's gonna come back. She's doing great
*  She's like handle it very well. But yeah, it's a
*  it was sad we left the hospital after like a couple days and
*  The saddest part is like we went outside and there's like a sunrise or a sunset and she's like I can't it doesn't look very pretty
*  To me. Oh, yeah, it was awful, but she's gotten a lot
*  She I think she can see a lot. She's more adjusted to it, but I feel so old
*  I'm like my girlfriend had a stroke
*  I got a pastrami sandwich for her there and I felt like just an old Jewish couple just eating a pastrami sandwich
*  After one of them had a stroke after one of them had a stroke like yeah, take your pastrami
*  Yeah, but uh, you know, I never thought in a million years I'd be the healthier one in the relationship
*  I
*  Selected a draw it's nice and evens out like when she had open heart surgery
*  We were both I make a bit about this but we were both kind of equally out of breath
*  We go up subway stairs and we'd both just be like, oh Jesus Christ
*  Yeah, but she's doing she's doing a she's doing great and she's you know, she she handled it very well
*  She's like a better person to me, which is kind of annoying. So even in the hospital, she was like super worried about she's a
*  Therapist you're super worried about like her patients while she was having a stroke. Oh, wow
*  It's kind of annoying when people are like that good. Yeah
*  That's the kind of therapist you want yeah, so she doesn't get jaded by the world not yet
*  Therapist that's another one. I mean you got to think everyone's out of their fucking mind because everybody you're talking to is either fucking mind
*  Oh, yeah, and she sees people like it's you know
*  She she helps she's a social workers therapist or she helps people who have like, you know
*  Typically can't afford like so it's not it's not white people problem therapy, right? It's like, you know safety planning
*  You know, how do I you know that kind of stuff? Right? It's not like I feel unhappy
*  It's like your husband beat you. How do we get you out of the house?
*  Yeah, she has an intense life but it's it's nice today because to me the hardest part about dating someone is their job
*  They have to tell boring work stories and you just have to deal with it, right?
*  But her stories are never boring. They're always like insane shit, you know, I guess that's better
*  It's better than pretending you care about like her friend being mad at her at you know, whatever after a certain point in time
*  You might look for that. Yeah
*  I'm looking for nonsense talk now. I like heavy do you I think so even when she told me she had about to get open
*  Heart surgery. I mean I like there I think excited but I was like, I'm not I don't I don't like shy away from right that stuff
*  You know, that's probably a good sign. Yeah. Yeah
*  No, it feels like we've been married for like 25 years now
*  Yeah, you've gone through a lot, right? Yeah, I really learn about someone someone's going through heart surgery
*  Yeah react to it in the hospital when she had it
*  There's like have you ever been to the hospital someone gets surgery? Mm-hmm
*  There's like a giant terminal thing that shows everyone's names and it says like in the middle if they're in the middle surgery or not
*  And then sometimes we'll just flash canceled
*  And you're like did that person die but I think they just like
*  Yeah, but yeah, it's intense
*  But I got a couple good bits out of it and that's what's important. Did she get upset that you have bits about it?
*  Maybe she might have been disturbed a little by the speed in which I
*  Well, it's tough I was in a rut a little and you know, sometimes you're in a rut with comedy
*  And then something crazy happens just right coming, you know, I mean, yeah the problem is if it involves someone else
*  We get in that we get in that. Yeah
*  Which I get I mean she's not a comedian she doesn't give us like I just want to be personal, right?
*  I want to bravely disclose all her personal
*  That's trouble you're having this is
*  Very brave for bringing this stuff up about you. Absolutely. I feel that way
*  But uh, but yeah, no, but she's yes, she's amazing
*  And yeah, it's my first like serious relationship and I'm already in like like serious and I'm already it's I went from like your first
*  Ever a serious one like moving in with the person. Oh, wow. I know I'm like 40
*  But you're a comic and it's like it's so hard for comics to just settle down to just staying put and doing things with a person
*  He's so used to just running from club to club and set to set and meeting your friends and it just becomes a bizarre
*  Lifestyle, especially when I moved to New York
*  I got into the cellar and at that point like you it's really hard to date people because you get a lot of spots
*  Right anyone but yeah, your night times are filled. Yeah, exactly and they get mad
*  You don't have to do a set tonight, but I do yeah, you have to I remember when I was dating this girl
*  I was 25 and she was like you don't have to go up tonight. I'm like, but I do
*  I suck I need to get better. This is only one way to do it
*  I know but I am working with like my therapist about realizing that like
*  You know, I always for yourself the person you're in relationship with is somehow like an enemy of your artistic
*  Process, you know, like they're there to stifle you it's it's an unhealthy way of thinking and I've tried to work about how did you develop
*  That way of thinking you think?
*  I
*  Think my mom though, she's great. It was like pretty overbearing like a Jewish mother and I think I she was so
*  Kind of like always like
*  Overbearing like always wanted to know where I am that I think my response was like go in my room and shut people out
*  And so I think I'm afraid if you're you know, she's a Jewish mother
*  So she just tells me what everything to do at all times, right?
*  So I think I've associated intimacy with someone I came up with this was my therapist brought this up
*  I'm not smart enough to realize this but I think I associate
*  Intimacy with someone trying to stifle me right me, you know, yeah as opposed to like something where you're trying to
*  You know be in something but that also can happen if you were someone who has
*  They don't understand like if they have unreal expectations
*  They expect you to just quit doing college guy a friend and he was a good comic and he was dating this woman who wanted
*  Him to get a job and he was doing pretty good
*  You know, he wasn't like headlining all the places but he was middling quite a few places and like he had some bits that were
*  Bangers he had some good bits and he could have been a really good comic when he and they got divorced
*  Couple years later like I ran into him three years later. He got divorced
*  He was trying to do comedy again
*  But he hadn't done comedy in three years
*  I've seen he lost all of his momentum and he couldn't get spots and no one gave a shit and everybody else had kind of
*  Moved on and moved up and that's a bad relationship because she doesn't understand him
*  Or like she thinks like my thing is my girlfriend doesn't think that way and I sometimes find myself projecting that onto her, right?
*  Can I project like like she'll just be like, I don't I'm not comfortable with you doing this joke
*  And I'm like quit trying to silence me
*  I think the thing was with this guy is that he was in his 30s and it hadn't happened yet
*  Yeah, and it was one of those probably the parents like what is he doing?
*  What if he doesn't make it, you know, right, right?
*  Like have you ever experienced that I had a girl that I was dating when I was 21 and her father said that like
*  What if he doesn't make it like that? I'm first of all, I'm fucking 21. Yeah, I'm a little kid, right?
*  Leave me alone. Yeah, second of all, like who not? Yeah, he's right. He's like who fucking knows I might not make it
*  But I'm gonna try I'm not gonna not try because I might not make it
*  That's a pussy's way to live life. Of course and like yeah, I mean you have to like I don't know
*  To me it's not about making but if you love something do it and do it if even if you're broke
*  I mean to me it's I don't believe in like I
*  Don't I don't think of things as having a safety plan David Mamet
*  I think was him said that like don't have a safety plan because you're under falling back on it. Yeah, that's common
*  Yeah, I'm a net don't have a net you will fall. I think you just have to if you love something like for me
*  I love comedy. I love like making movies. I'm focused on that. That's wonderful
*  But there are guys that are doing open mic nights for 25 fucking years and they're still terrible
*  Yes, maybe those guys should move on. Oh a hundred percent
*  The question is are you one of those people right and you well at 21?
*  I really didn't know if I was nice people but you have to at least give it a chance and
*  If you're dating someone that doesn't want you to do something wild and take a chance like this is not gonna work
*  Yeah, it's definitely good. Especially if you have a kid
*  I feel like it's definitely good to already have a career of some like I have a career
*  It's not like amazing, but it's a career. Yeah, and that helps like it's like I am making money
*  So yes, but it's really tough if you're like don't make money. Oh, yeah relationship
*  If you have a kid, oh if you have a kid and you're starting out as a comic boy
*  That is a fucking uphill slog your fuck cuz then you're also selfish now
*  Right yourself if you're taking spots. Yeah when you should be good. So that's that's tough
*  Yeah, well if you live in the city at least you do when everyone's asleep, right?
*  You know, I did when I was living in LA I would do 10 o'clock shows
*  So I'd be at home and then everybody's basically going to bed. I'm like I'm going out
*  I'm gonna go do shows so I do shows from 9 p.m. On that's true
*  But how was was it hard when you first had a kid like yeah, it's crazy. That's gotta be tough doing comedy
*  like it's crazy, but it's also you know, I
*  the thing is like they go to bed early and
*  As long as you have a spouse that understands what's going on and she's cool with it
*  You can go out and do sets
*  Yes
*  But if you're starting out then and this is like this pipe dream that you have and you're not making any money doing it
*  That's a totally different thing. Like I was already a headliner. I was on television. I was already making money. That's how we made money
*  I had to go do comedy. So that's a job, but it's not a dream, you know
*  It's like if you're chasing a dream in your 36 and you have three kids and you want to quit your job at the accounting company
*  Like yikes now you're kind of being an asshole. It's also it's like what are they you better get really?
*  Fucking good before you quit that job like yeah, how are you gonna have the time to get really fucking good?
*  Yeah, exactly. You want to like if you're gonna have a kid
*  I think we talked about it's a possibility at some points
*  Like you want to at least make enough money in your career that if you had a kid you'd actually just have to work harder
*  At your career as opposed to getting another career, right? Exactly. Exactly. And it's like
*  There's a lot of people that are they have the dream of stand-up, but they probably haven't really
*  Gone at it a hundred percent
*  Yeah
*  well
*  That's and they still have this thing in the back of their head that one day they will and one day they'll really
*  bear down and really start writing and really start performing more often and going up more than twice a week and
*  And they just don't and then they get into this situation where like oh my god
*  Everyone's kind of passed me by and all the guys I started out with are now working professionals touring the road and I'm still
*  Stuck in LA, right? Right, you know, yeah, you have to I mean you have to work hard at it
*  We were talking about if we had a kid
*  Like I was like talking and I was like well you would you know on the weekend
*  I'll be on the road
*  but during the during the day during the week I'd babysit the kid and she's like
*  Doesn't feel like you're very serious if you're referring to it as baby
*  Your own kid
*  Baby sap whose kids mine was seem like you're really committed to it
*  You have a very clear responsibility and it's not yours. I'll do your job for you if you want to take a nap
*  Thank you. I'm gonna do it for you. You do back to being the boss of the kids just pay me $10
*  Give me what number to call if anything goes wrong
*  Yeah, that's hilarious. But yeah, it's yeah having a kid is scary. But you know, I think it's good, you know
*  I think it's good. Yeah, but it's not good for everybody and it's not good
*  Depending upon what kind of relationship you're in right? You definitely can't do it to save. Oh my god
*  What are you doing? Are you crazy? You guys are about to break up now? Yeah
*  Sort I guess yeah, I mean you'll always talk I feel like kids break people apart more than anything
*  They break some people apart. They bring some people closer. They definitely brought me and my wife closer. Really? Yeah, it's not a
*  It doesn't have to be a negative thing. It's just like comics look at it as a thief of their time
*  I know, you know and you know, Louie said it best you said just got to let it change you
*  Yeah, you know, I thought that was really good advice because it definitely changes you and you can't resist it
*  You just got to be who you are now. You're just a different person now
*  You know now you're a person that's watching babies come out of your wife's body
*  And then grow up and talk to you and you take them to do things together and you having fun laughing together
*  It's like this very strange thing where a life that did not exist now exists, right?
*  And you love it more than anything you've ever loved in your life
*  You love this person and you love it no matter if the kid is like telling a boring story
*  Like it goes beyond like with your friends. You're like every story's gotta be entertaining, you know, yeah people you love it's like
*  You just love them. I talked to my kids about the most boring shit
*  To them it's not boring, you know, like they like to talk about bands they like and stuff they like and it's interesting
*  You know
*  It's fascinating to watch their little minds grow and the way they interface with the world and see them develop skills and things
*  All my siblings have kids they're a lot of fun. It's time to do it if you're 40
*  I know I keep on asking like I'm rushing I keep on acting like I'm rushing into things
*  I'm like, I don't know it seems so quick and then I'm like wait, I'm 40 years old
*  I always think I'm rushing into things when it's actually like the last chance
*  At least the last chance of that, you know, we will it's gonna be a little on hold to the stroke. Yeah
*  I would say that's probably a good move. Yeah, Jesus Christ. She's on blood thinners now. She's like a hemophiliac
*  How long did you stand those for?
*  What how long does she have to stay on those?
*  For until they figure out what kind of caused Roger Ailes is a hemophiliac. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah
*  Jesus that's a scary one. I know everybody could just punch you to death. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, give you a bloody nose and you bleed out. Yeah, it's crazy. That's nuts. Yeah, that's how she was
*  I mean, she's not like that now but in the ICU she's basically hemophiliac
*  Yeah, and so she has to stay on these for how long I think they're trying to find out exactly
*  Noah caused the stroke wow, they assume it's something to do as a heart surgery makes sense
*  Either that or God hates her and just giving her a bunch of shit a double whammy to deal with but but I think it's
*  Yeah, I think they'll find out but yeah, hopefully not. I mean, I think you'd have to get off if we had a kid
*  Yeah
*  We have like six six nephews and nieces. So you you're like you've got baby fever a little bit
*  Seems like you keep talking about it. Um
*  Little bit a little bit touch little touch
*  But also like also like not having a kid I don't know they both have good points and bad points for sure
*  I don't think everybody needs to but you know, there's a lot of people that have kids say everybody stuff kid
*  I think you can have a wonderful life without having children. I think it's totally possible
*  But well the people killed their kids probably should have had kids
*  Everybody should have it
*  Horrible story about this child prodigy that like the mother trained this child do everything
*  They rebelled at 18 and she killed him. Oh my god. Yeah. Oh rebelled against the thing
*  I mean, I forget what I was I got so disturbed by it
*  I turned the page but I was reading about this but that person shouldn't have had a yeah
*  Well, there's a lot of psychos that their kid is just a representation of the it's not an individual being
*  It's their property is them going through life that you will do what I tell you to do
*  You'll be a lawyer. You'll be a football player whatever the fuck it is
*  Like well, that's why the other bullshit thing and the people who act like kids make you a better person. That's not everybody
*  That's not true. Yeah, it's like the oxycodone thing. Yeah, who are you exactly?
*  Intensifies it's actually who you are
*  But now there's like much bigger moral consequences like you can be kind of a dick but it's not that big of a deal
*  But then if you have a kid and you're still a dick now, you're like a bad person
*  Yeah, well before you're just talking to kind of a dick or you're just exuding excellence in broadcasting
*  Kind of makes sense why he's so cocky the guy was like flying high all day
*  rush rush, yeah
*  That's excellence in broadcasting. Yeah, that was his thing. Right? Yeah excellence in broadcasting rush limbo
*  Just never at once just be at peace just made me think too like this whole idea of conservatives being like buttoned down
*  Sober people like look at the world clearly now your fucking main guys peeled out of his fucking mind
*  spouting out nonsense
*  They're like the real fucking hippies on all these drugs. Yeah, as long as it's prescribed by a doctor it's not a drug
*  That's how I go by it
*  I told the doctor I have an adderall problem
*  Funny to be like I have a real problem. We'll just prescribe it for you
*  That is so wild that they said that to you. I know it was insane. That's so wild. Yeah
*  Well, you need it you obviously you're on it
*  You shouldn't get off of it because then you could die or something
*  You could fucking be slow and not as it was hard to get off. It's hard to like go back to writing without it
*  Oh, yeah, it's tough
*  But it you know, I had to do it and I can't go back on it now
*  Chain smoke on it and I quit smoking and honestly that's more worrisome
*  Like if I took an adderall I would just chain smoke again
*  It seems like a lot of coping a lot of things going on your head right now talking about this
*  Oh, wait, what do you mean? It always has a grip on you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's like I could go back
*  I don't want to start change and I don't want to do that. So I don't go back. Let's do it. Let's relapse
*  Lloyd bridges from airplane bad day to get back on it. Yeah, I've avoided those but I've been curious about adderall
*  Have you never done it? Nope. Nope. Never done never done cocaine never done that at all
*  Yeah, but I when I was a kid I got very lucky and
*  Not lucky but one of my friends his cousin was addicted to coke and I watched this guy's life completely fall apart
*  He was selling coke and he was like a like he got bit by a vampire
*  Yeah, it was a different person like he was real skinny and like look all gaunt and shit and just coked up all the time
*  I'm not fucked up. You're not supposed to use your own supply. That's like a well
*  He didn't follow the rules
*  I think a lot of them don't follow it wasn't like a business man
*  He was a guy who like got coke and sold some of it such a nerd, but that's not that's not drug dealer protocol
*  I mean it's from you know, the biggie the ten crack commandments. He's had crack commandments
*  Don't get high off your own supply. Yeah, I
*  Yeah, I mean I I did a lot of coke back in the day too. It was I mean you see a lot of sunrises
*  Oh, yeah, it's pretty
*  That's good way look at it. I've seen way more sunrises now, right?
*  And I would have if I didn't do cocaine
*  But what about when you were getting up at farmer hours you saw a lot of sunrises then too
*  Yeah, but I was a kid I didn't appreciate it, you know
*  It's easier to stay awake than it is to get up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's a good point
*  If you're on Adderall, it's way easier to just stay up. That sounds like a profound line in a song
*  Yeah, like a Dylan line
*  When I was young I still love staying up all night ice thing was awesome that I would be going to bed when everybody was
*  Running around. Oh, yeah, it is. It's my favorite thing. It's a sacred time
*  I think this comedian friend of mine great comic Ben Moore. He he had an awful sleeping schedule where he would literally
*  Go to bed at 9 in the morning
*  Woke up at 5 p.m. It just started his day. Whatever it was like ending was he a comic? Yeah
*  That's comic life, yeah, that's a little too much that's a lot you need sunlight
*  Yeah, every now and then you probably shouldn't do that. But every now and again do it. I don't think it's so bad
*  But I like I mean I like sunlight. Yeah, I like to you know, it's good for you
*  Take a vitamin D high stale stay healthy
*  But I was when I was like in my early 20s when I lived in New York
*  I would stay up all night all the time. Really? Yeah, I go to bed not on cocaine
*  It's very no. Well high on life playing pool mostly. Oh, you're big pool guy
*  Yeah, so like I'd go to the clubs and afterwards go to the pool hall play pool till 4 o'clock in the morning
*  Go to a diner. Oh, wow get something to eat my friends 6 o'clock in the morning
*  I was hanging out with just complete derelicts. Uh-huh like pool hustlers and crazy people and and comics, you know
*  So it was like no one was normal. And so then it was normal. So I called someone at 5 o'clock
*  I said I just woke up they would think it was funny
*  Was up all night. It was normal. It wasn't like you loser, right?
*  You live in the crazy young life and you liked it, huh? It was good times
*  I was good. I say you could do that without cocaine. I feel like that's very impressive
*  Yeah, but when you're playing pool all night and you're drinking coffee and just hanging out
*  It's the time and also I was so used to it. Oh, so you I didn't have anything to get up for right?
*  I didn't have a job. So when you're doing comedy, yeah, I just started making money doing comedy
*  So I had enough money that I that comedy for the first time in life was like legitimately paying my bills
*  Oh paying my rent. I had a car like I was driving around to gigs
*  I was doing like headliner gigs in Connecticut and Jersey like 500 bucks there 350 there
*  I saw every week I was making like a good amount of money and I was just having a good time. That's great
*  I always they always talk about like the moment where you start making it you can quit your day job
*  Yeah, I've never happened
*  I had I would have day jobs and make a little money on comedy and then the day job would want to fire me because I
*  Wasn't there enough but I'd like no I need this job. I don't make enough in comedy and then they'd fire me
*  I'd be like forced to like focus on how many years in did you become a complete professional? I think like 11
*  Oh, wow. So you really did keep a job for you. The job held you back or do you think it helped you?
*  No, I only had like shitty like kind of like part-time job
*  I think I think around not I started opening for Kathleen Madigan on the road
*  And that's when I first started having money and she was great and it was great working. She's hilarious
*  She's amazing and she I really learned a lot from her and she's one of the best
*  And that's where I first kind of had money where I could like actually move to New York
*  I think I had part-time jobs and I was just living with my parents and doing comedy on the road
*  Going to like the looney bins. Mm-hmm taking Greyhounds. I took Greyhounds everywhere. It was I paid my dues
*  No, I would take it like an 18-hour Greyhound. Oh, I don't like a couple of times. It's insane
*  It was it was trips to a gig or rough. It's like the DMV on wheels. Yeah most depressing
*  So weird fucking people like where are you in normal walks of life other than Walmart?
*  You're like, yeah, how did you even get on a bus? You're like, it's I've heard like the craziest
*  Shit on like the Greyhound is just like an insane
*  But I would that's sorry about that one guy who cut a guy's head off on a Greyhound
*  I used to have a bit about it because you know, like other comics other
*  Other comics have like the observational airplane material, but I wasn't doing well enough to airplane. I'd open all my bits with Greyhound
*  Oh
*  Scott here from the Greyhound I had a bit about like I was I was surprised the bus even stopped after that
*  Usually usually just keep on going. Hope this shit works itself out
*  That guy was he was just like schizophrenic or something. He cut some guys head off that was sitting next to a friend
*  He cut it was a car neat Canada man who behead bus passenger granted freedom
*  What the Canadian legal system is insane. Wait, what? Yeah. No, he got he's like he got like out
*  He's been granted freedom full freedom. Yeah. No, it's crazy
*  When you read this will make you like appreciate America
*  He was deemed not criminally responsible and received mental health treatment a review board in Manitoba ordered his discharge without monitoring
*  Saying he did not pose a significant threat
*  When you behead someone on a bus, aren't you a significant threat? I just feel like once you beheaded someone that's it
*  That's it for you. Oh my god, right?
*  He removed his internal organs
*  Stabbed him. Oh my god
*  Attack began without warnings alerted by screens from the victim
*  The driver stopped the bus and fled with the passengers as mr. Baker continued his attack
*  He was found not criminally responsible in 2009 for the killing spent seven years in treatment secure wing of a psychiatric hospital
*  The voice told me I was the third story of the Bible that I was like the second coming of Jesus
*  And I was to save people from a space alien attack. Mm-hmm. He also said he was really sorry for what he
*  Generally I'm not a fan of that but in this in this stretch I put that back up
*  I like how they talk them completely out of context and said really sorry in quotes
*  Not even dot dot dot. I was killing to prevent space aliens, but also I bad
*  Are you sorry I'm really sorry
*  Okay, there's something about really sorry that's just very funny for that
*  I'm definitely doesn't pose a significant threat to the safety of the public imagine
*  Imagine if that's your friend this guy cut your friends head off and they just let him out. It's insane
*  No, I read they did a radio lab about this like in America if you behead someone that's like the end of year
*  That's a wrap. That's a wrap as it should be. I feel like once you cut off a head
*  There's no resuscitating your career, but there they just like observed him for a little bit. He believed the victim was an alien. Well
*  He had his reasons
*  You're about the lady in California that smoked weed and she stabbed her boyfriend. She killed him
*  She stabbed him like 11 times something crazy and they deemed her not criminally responsible because she went psychotic
*  She had a psychotic break, but he's saying was she really sorry. She was really she was really really really sorry
*  We I think she said really really so really really I think we're good
*  I feel like that guy needed another really don't you think that is one of those moments where I go
*  Okay, if that was a man that did that to a woman and had the same excuse
*  I do not think anybody would buy it. No not for a fucking second just to be like woman. Oh a hundred and eight times
*  Excuse me
*  Excuse me
*  108 times. Did I say 11 11? I met 108. She what the fuck California? I forgot a potent strain of pot
*  Yeah
*  Relax stop being so judgy
*  There's really potent do they have to call it potent?
*  Just got free. Hmm. She was convicted of involuntary
*  Manslaughter, what is the difference between involuntary involved? I didn't mean to kill him. I only stabbed 108 times
*  Yeah, I guess involuntary is one time should be attempted murder and if you actually kill them as murder
*  Well, yeah, of course that's one stab premeditated comes in for murder, right? Okay
*  But wait a minute isn't it second-degree murder if it's not premeditated. I think that's what it is
*  Yeah, I think that's the second-degree murder is like you don't mean to yeah man slaughters an accident
*  Isn't it weird that premeditated is worse
*  Because the other one is kind of like oh he could kill at any time without warning, but that should get a lesser sentence
*  Yeah, I think that's the scarier one the premeditated is like at least you at least you might know
*  If he's planning it again because he plans it, you know
*  I see what you're saying
*  But the other one reasons like the guy on the bus is like I could kill anyone at any time and they're like well
*  That's not as bad. Although the two were dating
*  Spetscher told the outlet she never considered Amelia her official boyfriend and said she told him she no longer had any romantic
*  Interest in him two days before killing him
*  Okay, she claimed he was aggressive intimidating and had an temper
*  She told the outlet so when he encouraged her to hit a bong on the day of the stabbing she gave into the pressure
*  Then went into a deadly psychosis. Well, I think her
*  Alibis that he was really annoying
*  He seems super annoying. He got real loud
*  Super shouty fuck that guy badger guy doing that but also sorry
*  So we're both accountable
*  Oh my god, but there's obviously been more attention to my part versus
*  The part where the guy got stabbed 108 times. Yeah, people are really focused on me
*  Yeah, I just don't think it's the full story such sexism and bullshit
*  I stabbed him 108 times but like he always yelling raised his voice a lot. He got shouty
*  Yeah, but they're just focusing on the and he scared
*  Okay, he fucking
*  Raised his voice. That's the process stabbing someone 111 times really underneath. Sorry. How'd you day that wasn't that potable?
*  Purpably
*  Although they say potent weed as if super and if that's the strand like you go to the drugstore
*  They're like this strand will have you stab your boyfriend month before the fatal encounter
*  Oh Amelia's roommate also had an extreme reaction after smoking out of the same bong Goldstein said he suffered
*  Hallucinations and fear of death, but that just sounds like you get too high
*  That's just what every time I get a fucking bong does this guy have?
*  Yeah
*  She only smoked pot less than a half a dozen times prior to the stabbing her lawyer said describing her as a
*  Naive user she's naive
*  But just imagine the sex is being reversed. She got really yelly and I got real nervous and
*  You know, I had only smoked pot like six times before that. Oh, well then in that case. Yeah. Yeah, are you really really sorry?
*  Well also like what about her part? Well, I guess she was kind of responsible
*  It's just funny that they're using weed like it's like it's a bath salts right crystal meth exactly. It was a really strong weed
*  31% THC look that's pretty high son, but it's like
*  Cautious caution for high tolerance users only
*  Yeah, but the problem is the side effects or the effects of marijuana do not match that at all. No, it's the opposite
*  I don't yeah, that's that's I think that's on her
*  Los Angeles based dispensary found marijuana flower for sale legally with th levels as high as 39%
*  That's even more potent similar levels were available Friday from a local competitor, but yet no one's running around stabbing people
*  It's just so crazy that they accepted that that sounds so nuts and you talk about victim blaming. What about Chad?
*  Chad was really shabby Chad and then nevermind. Yeah, never mind then didn't they say
*  That's his name, right?
*  It's not a good name for a guy that got stabbed automatically unless her name's Karen
*  Automatically gonna be on it was Sean
*  Why did she but it's like what we said like Chad Chad?
*  Chad people don't even care what the guys fucking name fuck Chad. I father Sean. I yeah, I mean like yeah
*  That's what we talked about for when the drug brings out who you are inside, right?
*  Like the killing of the stabbing someone hundred eight times. That's that's you
*  You know also like how do you keep doing it after you do it one or two? How do you know?
*  After a while that's so crazy like your arm must get tired you stabbed him a hundred and eight times
*  She's a pretty impressive workout. She probably like hurt herself. Yeah that was
*  to
*  What about that? It's a good point. Yeah, it's just I couldn't imagine ever a scene those roles reversed. There's no way
*  Yeah, I stabbed her a hundred eight times. But here's the thing. She was real naggy
*  Super shouty and I was pretty high
*  Yeah, and I don't get that high all right you are
*  Five or six times that's not like that first time
*  Five or six times is like, you know what we does but we doesn't doesn't do that. It doesn't make you kill people
*  No, no, I mean you can go crazy though. You can freeze some people freak out
*  They really do look but but that she must have really despised that guy and that might have popped out of her
*  With this fucking idiot that's in there not that deep it's not like you're just like yeah fuck yeah hundred and eight times
*  I mean I've had like
*  You know you get I get anxious on weed. Yeah, but you don't go around stabby
*  No, I just sit there thinking everyone's gonna hate me and I'm gonna die. I don't like think about stabbing people eight times
*  That is that is excessive if you did anything a hundred times on your high you meant you probably meant to do it
*  Yeah, it seems like if you hit 108 golf balls, that's what you're trying to do
*  Fucking time
*  That amount of stabbing that sounds so crazy
*  I want to know if she was on anything else along with it because you know
*  Like if you mix like Zoloft with cocaine, it's very dangerous
*  There's certain things that you if you mix stuff with no bueno, really? Yeah people lose their fucking marbles
*  What's bad with prozac? I'm on that's a good question. What is bad with prozac? Let's find out if you're on prozac
*  Should you be taking edibles? Oh
*  Boy, what happens?
*  Take one every night. Oh
*  Well, you're the test. It's fine for you. I was looking up. That's the thing
*  It's like what's fine for you is not fine for everybody
*  I was looking up Nike will cuz I was taking I also take a sleeping pill
*  I wanted to see if Nike will here goes. Okay, you shouldn't take
*  It may increase your risk for bleeding problems
*  Oh a couple of strokers
*  Make sure your doctor knows if you're also taking other medicines that thin the blood including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen
*  Oh
*  Well, I think I think I'm all the time in event interacts with monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAO eyes
*  Other antidepressants and blood thinners. I sound like I'm okay. I can't
*  That's saying don't take
*  Ayahuasca though. Oh really? Yeah, I'm not really I don't think I would take ayahuasca. Well, don't do it
*  If you're on the Prozac don't do it
*  I'm not it says non-steroidal it said non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and MAO inhibitors and that's one of the ingredients
*  serious bleeding serotonin syndrome
*  What's bleeding? I think it's about the blood thinning stuff. Oh really manufacture Prozac recommends
*  Whoops that you avoid drinking and alcohol while taking this drug. Hey, I don't drink. There you go alcohol can worsen
*  Blah blah blah blah
*  Hey, I think I'm good. Okay. I think we're good. Just don't take my girlfriend's blood thinners
*  Does the Prozac make you kind of speedy at all? No, I have I have a really bad anxiety
*  I've had my whole life and I was on Paxil for like 10 years and then I tried to get off of it
*  Like what is Paxil was that one? It's like an ant. It's just another SSRI
*  Yeah, yeah, and I got off of it like five years ago just weaned off of it
*  And then like six months later, I had the worst panic of my life
*  I basically was dizzy for like three months straight. Oh boy
*  I had a panic attack at every show just on stage every open mic open mic or whatever
*  I'd have a panic attack on stage was awful and
*  No super dizzy and it was my psychiatrist said it wasn't even withdrawal. This is the same one that gave you the Adderall
*  No, no, no
*  You one of those guys that shops around for different psychiatrists. Well, that was in Louisville
*  After I went to rehab, I was like, maybe I should get a different shrink
*  but
*  The he I had like terrible like dizziness and I had to get on something else
*  I got on Prozac and it helped a little with that
*  Is there anything else that helped other than the Prozac is any activities that I have to like
*  Have my girlfriend, you know have bore her with having sex for too long. It helped that you know
*  Cuz it makes you
*  What is it? Well, actually it keeps you from getting it up
*  But I don't have that problem so it does okay
*  So the Paxil was helping you in a different way than the Prozac is the same thing
*  I just don't want to go back on Paxil cuz Paxil had like a lot of weight gain
*  So I went on Prozac and then gained the weight anyway
*  And does the what was the difference in the way you felt on Paxil versus on Prozac?
*  Both of them make it honestly made me feel kind of like the same which is just like a somewhat anxious person
*  The problem was when I was on Paxil
*  I
*  Thought I didn't need it. But the reason I thought I didn't need it is cuz I was on it
*  You know, I mean, that's the problem with people get off antidepressants. They're like, well, I don't need it
*  No, that's because it's working. All right, so unless just like a problem
*  I don't know when I got off of it. It was like a nightmare that anxiety I had it was like truly like
*  Especially having panic attacks on stage. Jesus. It's so shitty cuz we all get anxiety
*  But usually I come to believe that anxiety leaves you once you get on stage
*  Like it's a comfort zone right and I had lost that for a long time. I like had panic like all throughout a set
*  Was there anything else that you tried that helped that at all I try it, you know, I try to meditate
*  Did that do anything it helps a little honestly the thing that helped the most was panic attacks on stage
*  Was just continuing to have them to the point where you notice it doesn't
*  Doesn't doesn't destroy the world like right because I would actually
*  Still do okay on stage
*  Actually people wouldn't really notice
*  Like I go off after like that was horrible. They're like, I don't even notice, you know
*  Which makes you feel more alone by the way the fact that you can have this hell in your head and no one notices
*  And when you were doing this whether sometimes you didn't have the hell in your head or did it happen every time? I
*  Think it happened for those three months like almost every time
*  I mean sometimes maybe not or if I was doing a long set like an hour maybe go away after a while
*  But I honestly think just having them and then realizing it's not a big deal. They can still do the show
*  That made it go away because I think for the worst thing you can do is anxiety
*  It's like run away from it
*  Like if you're anxious when you go outside the worst thing you can do is just not go outside because then it like builds
*  so having I if anyone has panic attacks on stage just continuing to have them and letting your brain know that
*  It's not a big deal that it's not gonna destroy you then it starts to go away
*  Wow
*  So now I'm back to not really having them on stage
*  But yeah, I was it was tough like getting off medication was like a harsh show
*  I mean, I kind of wish I was never on it to begin with, you know
*  Do you wish you were on Prozac to begin with or do you think that like did something about taking the anti-anxiety?
*  Medication accentuate it when you got off it
*  accentuate that yeah
*  Like the anxiety that did you have the same level of anxiety before you did Paxil that you had when you got off of it?
*  I
*  think it was more like
*  I mean, it's all a mystery. I guess why exactly but I think it was more like all
*  This anxiety it was this giant wave of anxiety that I just happened to have in my life
*  I just come out with a special and I was feeling this like I
*  Had this urge to just like create more stuff and like just you know that feeling you have where you just want to get out
*  As much stuff because you're gonna die. I had that urge kind of big
*  I was like I gotta do the next thing the next thing and
*  Then actually the way it started I was at my brother's place and I looked in the mirror and I saw these
*  Moles on my back and I was just convinced they were skin cancer. Oh, that's how it began and not like I always had hypochondria
*  But this was different. This was like I knew I was gonna die and then I went to the doctor and they were like
*  It doesn't look like skin cancer and then the next day I stood up and was dizzy
*  It was dizzy for like three months straight. Jesus Christ. Yeah, I think it was a
*  Wave of anxiety just where I was in my life, but for the for the first time in ten years
*  I didn't have something to mask it which I think made it more intense
*  You know, you know, I mean how long we off it for?
*  About like four months and then I and then I slowly got on project maybe a little more so four months of hell
*  Yeah, it was awful and it was just like
*  Yeah, it was awful. So did you have that level of anxiety when you were younger?
*  When I was really young I'd have these really bad screaming fits
*  Like when I was like eight or nine, I would just suddenly have these moments where I was like
*  I don't know this moment just feeling hopeless or something. I just started yelling and my parents never knew what it was
*  I actually would cut myself a couple times like on the leg just to like distract it. Oh, wow, and I had those
*  And I didn't know what it was and then in college. I
*  Also started doing cocaine which didn't help and then I had some like really bad
*  Kind of anxiety in college and that's when I went on Paxil originally, you know
*  Yeah, but no, I've always had like really bad anxiety. Damn. Do you have anxiety? Yeah
*  And it's so funny after this long thing
*  I could talk myself into it. I could talk myself out of it. Yeah, I get anxiety about
*  Existential threats like I get anxiety about war sometimes like late at night
*  I get anxiety about like the more I read about history
*  Yeah, the more I understand, you know how many times in history
*  Society was everything was great and everything was fine
*  And then all sudden some terrible event took place and then we went back to like the Stone Age
*  like this is an imminent threat to life that we
*  We look at the goings-on in the world as if it's like some plot in a television show that we're watching
*  You're watching what's happening in Ukraine you watching what's happening in Gaza and you're watching what's happening in Iran
*  And you're watching all this crazy shit and it doesn't seem real because it hasn't affected you but it went late at night when everyone's asleep
*  That's when it gets me right all the hard
*  Yeah, I just started thinking that this this
*  ridiculous life that we live and all the
*  Stupid societal conflicts that we have that are mostly meaningless and nonsense and that they're accentuated constantly in the news all the while
*  Real people are dying right and like drone
*  Suicide bombs you can watch them on on YouTube. Well, we're just having like culture war
*  Yeah, I mean I've seen so many people die on Instagram reels
*  So many people get blown up by missiles and blown up by drones
*  Suicide drones slamming into people and detonating them. I watched this guy
*  Some guy forget what part of the world it was, but he wore a suicide vest
*  They tried to stop them and these guys run and they grab them and they all explode
*  They're trying to stop them from pulling the and this this bomb goes off
*  You see just parts of people flying and you're like fuck man. This is all happening in the world right now
*  It's just not happening right here. You're watching it. You're like for some reason. I'm really anxious right now
*  Yeah, I get freaked out and I started thinking about just how
*  Fragile our civilization really is. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's completely fragile
*  I mean, yeah, and we're so soft. We're so accustomed to living this way
*  We're so like when the power went off earlier when we're doing this podcast. What do we do?
*  We wait for it to come back on. Yeah
*  I used to have a bit about that like when the dumb people out fuck the smart people and the house goes off and no
*  One has any idea
*  Like what do you do? Somebody does it they do it and but yeah, what if that guy's dead?
*  Like do we know and when do we know how long afterward do we figure out the powers not coming back?
*  Right is crazy. The world is just functioning off of just yeah
*  No one's really running the ship. It's just a collective thing of functioning and we're connected by the most fragile thing
*  We have yeah, which is the power grid and our computer infrastructure
*  Yeah, all of it can be wiped out in one solar flare and we take it so much for granted
*  Yeah, it's the only reason why we're alive. It's a hundred degrees outside and I have a hoodie on right?
*  I'm super comfortable in here. We have air conditioning. We're fine. We're dying of heat exhaustion. We're not there dehydrating to death
*  Yeah, you know where the water is ignored the fact that nature can be a threat and we're just so vulnerable and we're so
*  Reliant to keep this civilization going the way it is
*  Look think about what we've been talking about today
*  like if you go back and watch films from like the 1930s and 19 how horrific people treat each other and over time
*  Because of our access to all these different human beings and how they feel about things and how they discuss things all that is kind
*  Of elevated our discourse and elevated the way we communicate with each other and we interact with each other and we demand more
*  Right, and there's gonna be over compensation and it's gonna things are gonna go back and forth
*  But generally it's moving in the right direction
*  But that's only because all of our needs are met and because there's electricity
*  Electricity is the thing that changed everything when you can stay cool and stay warm you can live in places
*  You shouldn't be living. Yeah, and then we just hell to live in without cities would be all cities would be a hellhole
*  Yeah, there's no food. No one's growing food. How do you eat? Well as soon as trucks stop coming in everyone's fucked
*  Yeah, there's no food you have enough food for like a few hours of everybody eating and then that's it
*  Yeah, the Gaza stuff is awful. It's horrifying. It's such a you know, I'm Jewish obviously if you can't tell I think you brought that up
*  It's been it's it's been such a complicated horrible thing and it's just it's just horrible all around it is complicated and horrible
*  And it's also complicated when you see so much anti-semitism
*  Like open anti-semitism about all Jews as if there's like this cabal of evil people that are pulling the strings
*  I know I've posted you know, I think I hate Netanyahu. I hate this really government
*  I think both Gaza and Israel have taken been taken over by extremists, you know, right
*  But I've posted concern for anti-semitism and I've been like attacked by people like how can you be worried about that?
*  When people are dying in Gaza and I'm like, there's two different things. Yeah, they're both real
*  Yeah, they're both real and I have a right to be concerned
*  Jews have a right to be a little nervy. Yeah
*  Remember, yeah, we have a right to get cautious, you know, but it's also that's one of the things that I forget who was talking
*  To us about this it might have been Jordan Peterson
*  But it was so many it was somebody when they were saying that it's one of the hallmarks of a civilizations decline
*  They start blaming things on the Jews. It is it's really common. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, you stick together and you know, they it's a very difficult club to get into you know
*  Well, I think what people have done too is there are a lot of there is an extremist faction in Israel
*  Yes
*  who are like all by the way was being protested for months on end before October 7th and what people aren't doing they're not giving Israel the
*  Benefit of a conflicted soul and a lot of the anti-zionist propaganda is making you think all of Israel is like that
*  Exactly, but it's it's no different than another country like America. It's a conflicted place
*  There are extremists and some of them are awful and that's you know
*  Who has put a lot of them in his government made a coalition with them?
*  But there's also people who want peace people who want you know, Palestinian self-determination all human beings everywhere in the world
*  There's good people. It's like if you hated Trump, but then you assume when he was president
*  Everyone in America supported Trump, right? Right if you thought that it's like right
*  it's very dehumanizing to think like all of Israel is like
*  Just in support of the genocide and God right and then you see polls
*  65% of people say it's okay to rape Palestinian prisoners. Who did you talk to?
*  Who did you talk to 65% of who the fuck is answering that poll?
*  Yeah, let me ask you a couple questions about rape
*  Answering that we talking about raping prisoners. I'm all in by the way. I'm on my way to work. I gotta go
*  well, yeah, it's like there's also like there's obviously a lot of
*  Horrible shit Israel is done. But a lot of people go beyond that and make it
*  It's not just like it's fine to be like they don't put civilians in
*  Like they don't think about civilians
*  I understand that the critique but a lot of people want to make it look like they're like going out of their way to just
*  Only kill civilians. They have a goal. It might be bad and reckless
*  Yeah, but there's been things like the killing of the aid workers, you know, like the hose I undresses people
*  Yeah, which is like seems like they were targeted. I don't know
*  It's hard to believe the purpose for that the target to keep people from getting food to the Gaza refugees
*  Yeah, I don't know. I don't like I
*  Don't have a position. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, that's that's the people think your station is that they knew who those people were
*  I think Israel I
*  Think I don't it's hard for me to believe that that's where they I do think they want to get rid of Hamas
*  I think a lot of people have died. It's awful and I don't think it's worth it all this at all
*  But I don't think they're like you don't think that some people have a
*  dehumanization way of looking at Palestinians
*  Yeah, for sure. Yeah, well that I think that's what you're looking at when you're seeing soldiers rape Palestinian prisoners. You've seen that video
*  Yeah, I know that that that camp is awful
*  Yeah, the whole awful truly a nightmare
*  Look whenever a human being is capable of doing something like that to another human being that they don't even know they consider that person
*  You've got a giant problem and that's the giant problem of being able to just bomb Gaza into oblivion
*  You kill who knows how many thousands of people it's it's almost like the United States is reaction after a 9-eleven
*  9-eleven we were the whole world was on our side
*  Yeah, everybody wanted America to process we can't believe America was attacked America this shining beaking
*  Beacon of democracy and self-government like no not America
*  Then what do we do we invade Iraq, right?
*  And we kill a million people wind up dying because of our invasion they think and then you think about the weapons of mass destruction
*  Hosts, it was all bullshit and it was paraded in the media. So it's like that
*  It's like our overreaction was so horrific then everybody hated America. I agree with that
*  I do think what Hamas did was so horrific and they said they're gonna keep doing it
*  It did plant these seeds of hate in Israelis that no doubt even I'm in the position
*  We're like obviously this war is terrible
*  I don't think should have happened
*  But I also think it's a lot to ask people to have something so horrific happen and not them kind of retaliate
*  So I'm against it if that makes sense. I know what you're saying that people would retaliate
*  It's the way they're retaliating and the scale of course, which is horrific to people but I also yeah, I mean I think
*  There's dehumanization on both sides for sure
*  The only way you can do October 7th is dehumanization
*  Of course, and I do think people on both sides have tried to demean the other or trivialize the other person's accountability
*  I know it's crazy that the and also people pretending as if they know what actually happened and what the stats are
*  Yeah, they didn't do that. They didn't do this. Are you on the ground?
*  That's the human to me saying like there's no rape then is like dehumanization
*  All of it is crazy
*  Like you don't fucking know what's actually going on and there's a lot of misinformation
*  That's even printed in mainstream media like this does the bombing of the hospital?
*  There's a lot of shit that happened that was front page of the New York Times
*  There's a lot of shit that happens in the fog of war that they people want to know the answer right away
*  And you I know it's upset hard, but you have to wait sometimes like the fog of war
*  You're not gonna always have the answer right away
*  I mean, I'm not saying Israel isn't culpable of a lot of things, but you do have to wait
*  I see people sharing information that's not verified all the time that just came out where you're like, you don't well
*  That's the hospital bombing. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what that is. I mean that made it all the way into newspapers. Exactly
*  I mean, I think like
*  Nithya, Nia who created a coalition with some really awful people like Smotrik and Ben Gevier. There are like
*  really Jewish supremacists real thugs and
*  and I think a lot of anti Zionists have tried to convince everyone that all of Israel is like that
*  Hmm, and I just think yeah both there needs to be less dehumanization and just saying like yeah
*  Suffering in Gaza is horrible. It needs to stop but also like not every Israeli is
*  part of some evil Zionists whatever
*  Conspiracy that's its own inverted form of anti-semitism. Well Netanyahu is this super pro military guy. I mean he was a
*  Special forces guy. Yeah, and he's corrupt and he has charges against him that he's trying to like
*  Weaken the government to prevent from coming through and he made a coalition
*  With two people who are truly awful awful people and that and that is really almost
*  These people want a theocracy in Israel, you know, they want but that's not all of Israel people have protested against that
*  That's my fear when I'm up in the middle of the night
*  Yeah, that this kind of shit is going on that any minute it could pop off and become a nuclear war
*  I mean, that's a legitimate. It's a legitimate fear. I don't know if that's anxiety. I don't whatever it is
*  That's if you ask me if I get anxiety, that's my anxiety
*  No, I can totally see when I get really freaked out
*  That's what freaks me out
*  What freaks me out is that it could pop off at any minute and then we and then it all of a sudden it's September
*  12th, you know, yeah, but way better way bigger way crazy waste waste carrier and
*  That hasn't happened since 1945. So we assume that it's not going to happen again. Yeah, we had 20 good years and now we think everything
*  We had like some good time in the 80s and now I can never go back
*  Oh, dude, when the wall fell down, it was amazing
*  There was like a weight lifted off of America like everybody. Yeah, oh Soviet Union's gone
*  Ha we don't have to worry about a nuclear war with Russia anymore. And now it's China and Iran and fuck and this and that
*  Oh my god
*  It is like most periods of history people had kind of a shitty life in a volatile period of history
*  We really like up till like I guess
*  After Vietnam and maybe it to the you know now
*  To the last till everything's kind of falling apart now like it was kind of smooth sailing I guess for a little bit
*  But like as long as you're in America, yeah, it's not smooth sailing. Yeah people like
*  A lot of places where it sucked bad. Well, that's the other thing that yeah, it's never it's been shitty for it's always shitty for someone
*  That's the things we're not used to it happening right here. We're very spoiled
*  Oh, we're so spoiled like the Russians are so much more used to it than us. They lost so many people during World War two
*  Yeah, well there's I'm reading this thing about France
*  This is so crazy that during World War one France lost
*  25% of its fighting-age men and then during World War two, they lost another 25%
*  It's insane like your life fuck man
*  Well, that's the thing life was so cheap and now we feel like life is kind of expensive
*  We're now we're like life has value, you know, but it's still so cheap for so many people
*  Well, it is in other parts of the world. That's yeah
*  It's like we're so used to not being attacked that when something like 9-eleven does happen like Pearl Harbor happen
*  It was five hours over the ocean. I know the only other time we were attacked. Yeah, you know, we're so soft
*  We are soft. We're soft as baby poo, but we're seeing a lot of violence
*  I mean we see every you see the guy shot Trump you see his head exploded on the roof
*  You see everything think that was all about a
*  Guy trying to just just a guy trying you don't think he has some help. No, no
*  Do you think Harvey Oswald acted alone? Yeah, I'm not good with I've got a big
*  So the bill Hicks joke you don't buy into it. I love the joke you love the joke, but I'm not a big
*  I'm not a big have you ever read into that one. I read a little yeah, you need to read more
*  That's one you really shouldn't be flipping about they killed that fucking guy
*  Here's the thing was Trump though. Like why why would he need so we got you thought like Biden's trying to take him out
*  Um, I don't think it was Biden
*  I think it could be a number of people that were involved but it seems at the very least like they were
*  so
*  lacks
*  Insecurity that they were inviting something to happen at the very least and knowing that that guy was walking around
*  More than 30 minutes before with a rangefinder right seeing that guy he'd come back and forth
*  He observed him multiple times people were talking about them
*  Keeping an eye on him and this guy gets on the roof with a rifle and gets off three shots
*  Well, my thing was a lot of conspiracy theories. It just kind of ignores the incompetence
*  I feel like incompetence is a real thing incompetence is a real theory, you know, you know, it's real thing conspiracies
*  The problem with dismissing
*  Conspiracies as being just a silly conspiracy theories
*  That was the whole goal the Warren Commission report and that was what that was when right the term conspiracy theory got into the zeitgeist
*  Why don't you as a pejorative I don't dismiss and I didn't mean to offend no
*  I don't dismiss. There's a huge amount of corruption and horrible things. I just think a
*  lot of times incompetence just does play a big part and I do think like there is
*  incompetence and there's like
*  Randomness a lot and some dude had a really good joke about it that he put up on Instagram
*  It was very funny. Let's see if I could find maybe you can find it Jamie. He said
*  That it was basically like if I thought they were gonna try to
*  Assassination attempt that seems exactly how the government would do it like really inefficient
*  It was like he said it was like the DMV of
*  assassination attempts
*  Find this dude who sent that to me. But like but it's also I mean, I guess for me
*  It's like you also have to like you find it
*  Fox let me send it to me I get too many texts anything can be real
*  But I also think the the idea that he was a lone shooter is not that world is not a crazy world the idea that
*  We're in a violent place. No, I'm not saying has guns. No that not saying that he wasn't a lone shooter
*  I think he was a lone shooter. Maybe there was other shooting on him
*  I think he was trained and I think somebody got him detonators. He had sophisticated
*  detonators and
*  Explosive devices. That's why you're like lone shooter a train by the I think someone talked that guy into doing that
*  I think I don't think someone talked that kind of doing it
*  I think it's possible that someone talked that kind of doing that. Yeah, I mean anything's possible
*  I'm not I'm not like dismissing that I just think like he's like a school shooter who got
*  Political, you know, they took his body away and cremated it ten days after the assassination. No toxicology report
*  No public there's been no press conference about it. No telling all the details. Here's what we know
*  They went to the kids house. It was professionally scrubbed didn't have silverware in it, right?
*  There's a phone that was going back and forth because you know, they have ad data
*  They can track cell phone when they ping
*  There's a phone going back and forth between the offices of the FBI and Washington DC in this kid's house on multiple occasions
*  Well, yeah, I don't I don't know about that, but I don't know that's where things get weird, right?
*  You'd hate me with my views. I don't know
*  I would not hate you with your views. I'm like the opposite of a conspiracy theorist. That's interesting
*  So you think Epstein killed himself? I'm not saying he definitely killed himself
*  But I also think it is
*  Believable that he is a little depressed at that point. Certainly, you know, I mean that's what I think. I think like the possible I
*  think the the possibility of it not being a conspiracy is an
*  Sometimes very like plausible sure to the point where I don't need if you need a go-to conspiracy
*  Like some maybe got killed but Epstein was also not in a great place at that point true
*  You know, I mean so I could see that both ways, but then you have to look at the autopsy
*  Yeah, you have to look at the ligature marks around the base of his neck
*  Which is not really what happens when you hang yourself when you hang yourself you you your weight of your body is what kills you
*  Yeah
*  So the ligature marks those strangulation marks are underneath the chin his was down by his neck and his neck was actually fractured
*  Which is also indicative of someone getting strangled to death. Dr. Michael Baden. Who's that?
*  forensic
*  Scientist that did that show autopsy remember that show. Yeah HBO. He examined the
*  the
*  Autopsy examined what what the results were and he found that the fractures in the neck were indicative of someone being strangled to death
*  What is another corner who said it was like sure?
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Well, it seems very convenient that the cameras went out
*  Yeah, it seems very convenient that the people that were on security were asleep seems very convenient all of it seems convenient
*  Yeah, no, I'm not saying he didn't get killed
*  I'm just being the most high-profile
*  Defense witness in a very important case that might have been about elites and child pedophilia
*  Would probably you want to take that guy out?
*  But also a narcissist who's gonna be about to be the most who's that most hated person in the world?
*  Could also I could see him killing himself. Sure. I'm just saying good. I'm not saying he didn't kill
*  He could have killed himself. I mean he could have been killed. So how long you been working for the government?
*  I
*  Think I think Oswald acted alone. I don't know. I'm a believer in incompetence in that everyone is
*  Most people are bad at their job. You're watching this is a pewter film
*  Yeah, film of Kennedy's head going back into the left. Of course, how do you think that happens when you get shot from behind?
*  Back it. What do you mean? His head goes back into the left like you got shot from the front. I
*  Don't know. I don't I don't you never see that was a
*  I see yeah back into the left
*  But I I also think they've tried so long to find the conspiracy for that and they and they always kind of gunster dead end
*  I don't know. I think what Oswald did was I like the way you think, you know, you don't want to think about it this way
*  I like it. I like what you're saying. Well to me
*  I think a lot of conspiracy theorists think like the other person like I'm naive, right? Mm-hmm, but I think it's the opposite
*  I think like
*  It's sometimes gonna be naive to think somewhat. There's someone mastermind everything, right?
*  like to me I think like and I don't know all the evidence I'm sure there's all these reports and stuff but like
*  To me, I think like sometimes crazy shit happens and when you look at it backwards, it doesn't
*  Yeah, it's crazy that he shot someone from that far to work. You know, I mean, that's true
*  But it's also crazy shit happens and we also have never seen a lot of times stuff happens where we've never seen that like 9-eleven
*  Mm-hmm. We know I had two planes hit a building but you immediately had people being like buildings don't fall like that
*  It's like the first time it's happened. That's true
*  So it's like yeah, we don't always know like it's a lot of times something happening
*  That's crazy, but also like never happened before that people are like, that's not how it happens. But it's like, how do you know?
*  That's true like planes flying into the buildings, especially the buildings of that tall
*  That's all true. And I do think you know, I've read you know, it's 9-eleven
*  There's so much incompetence as a government lack of communication between the FBI and the CIA, you know
*  And I I'm a firm I'm not saying some conspiracies aren't true. Definitely and there's a lot of corruption
*  But I'm just a firm believer in incompetence incompetence is real but conspiracies are too some conspiracy
*  Yeah, Lee Harvey Oswald one when you look into it, it's it's pretty nutty
*  Yeah, it's pretty nutty
*  You know a lot of people heard shots from the grassy knoll the amount of people that were eyewitnesses that died in mysterious ways
*  Right extraordinary like off the charts
*  Odds like that don't make any sense, but I also do think sometimes the brain like finds patterns
*  Sure and also people kill people that happens to both the thing about the Oswald thing is there's also a lot of evidence at points
*  The fact that they were trying to come to the conclusion that there was a lone gunman despite the evidence
*  Mm-hmm. And one of those is the magic bullet theory the magic bullet theory is fucking cuckoo for Cocoa puffs
*  That that shit would never fly today
*  What is it the bullet went through and then you went through Kennedy and then into Connolly and then they found it in pristine condition
*  on the gurney and then they attributed that bullet to all these wounds because they had to
*  Because there was only three shots supposedly and in those three shots that Oswald was able to get off
*  They knew one of them hit the back and they knew one of them was hit Connolly and one of them blew up his head
*  Well, they had all different bullets for these things for these different injuries
*  But then a guy got hit with a ricochet and the underpass
*  so they had to account for one of those bullets missing the target and hitting the the
*  Whatever it is granite curb stone and banging into this guy's face. I think I had to go to the hospital
*  They found the curb stone that had been hit with a bullet and so they knew that a ricochet had hit there
*  So now they had two bullets that had to have all these wounds and so instead of saying hey
*  Maybe there's more than one person shooting
*  Maybe there's more than this one guy that was in the book depository all these people said there were shots coming from the grassy
*  No, maybe they were telling the truth right instead of that. They said no no no no one bullet went crazy went
*  Oh, look, we found it. Here's all good and look at the bullet. All right, I'll give you Oswald
*  Look at that bullet that bullet supposedly went through two people and they found it in that condition on a gurney
*  If you've ever shot anything with a bullet, you know, that's straight horse shit. That's not deformed at all. That's shattered bones
*  That's nonsense. But what is the answer? I feel like there's so many answers about what happened, right?
*  Well, if you read the Warren Commission report and fucking nobody has
*  That that's also there's different like see the hole in his neck
*  It's supposed to have gone through his back through his neck
*  but in the first autopsy report that hole in the neck was thought of as an entrance wound and then in when it got to
*  Bethesda, Maryland, then they said it was tracheotomy hole
*  there's like a lot of inconsistencies in the Warren Commission report and if you
*  If you want to go crazy read a book called best evidence by David Lifton who was an accountant
*  Okay
*  Read the entire Warren Commission went over it and found all these inconsistencies and said they were just trying to come to this one
*  conclusion and he didn't buy it but
*  I'll check it out. But also like
*  There can be inconsistencies are also part of incompetence or not communicating as well. Can it?
*  inconsistencies yeah, but I mean like people like different reports that don't or even him trying to force something like I
*  Mean like I just think sometimes like the thing has to be like nothing's perfect and there is like a lot of like
*  I also don't think Lee Harvey Oswald acted. I think Lee Harvey also was a part of it. Yeah, I don't think he acted
*  Like this I think he was the guy that they were pinning it on well, he was definitely active with the CIA
*  He'd gone over to Russia. He'd married a Russian woman came back to America. I was doing a lot of weird communist shit
*  He was involved in a lot of weird stuff that seemed to indicate that he was some sort of intelligence agent
*  Yeah, or at least a patsy a guy that could pin this on which is probably what they want
*  I'm not yeah, I'm not denying it that it could happen. I guess that it's a possibility. I guess for me. It's just like
*  Usually when there is something a conspiracy it gets it doesn't get found out
*  Yeah, but this is great evidence
*  They there was no internet back then and they didn't even see this a pruder film until 12 years later
*  This is a pruder film nobody even saw it until it was on the Geraldo Rivera show in 1975 and Dick Gregory brought it
*  On so you know what I read in the Seymour
*  Was his name he did a book about Camelot
*  That apparently Kennedy was fucking someone at the pool and pulled his groin have you read this two days beforehand?
*  And he had like a back brace on
*  Hmm and when he got shot cuz he got shot twice right he got shot well
*  Yeah, at least twice is they think three times
*  They think that's one through the back one through the neck and one in the head
*  But I heard they said like because of the back brace when he got shot the first time it didn't push him over
*  So it's kind of like a sitting duck
*  Like the back brace almost kept him up with the shot we had he was all fucked up
*  He had a lot of like real physical problems
*  And he was also a guy that was getting treatment from Dr. Feelgood
*  Yeah, that's where dr. Feelgood came from my psychiatrist
*  Yeah, real similar like this one doctor, and I think a lot of that was meth as well
*  It was a habit of wearing a tightly laced back brace that may have kept him from
*  Recoiling to the floor of his car after the assassins first bullet to the neck
*  Setting him up for the kill shot the brace was firm so this is also
*  This is not the back shot either was a shot in the neck that again the initial autopsy said was an entrance wound
*  Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah makes sense that it kept him stiff. He was all fucked up though
*  He had like yeah see portrait of pain
*  See he had like some real serious problems
*  numerous back surgeries
*  They so they hid
*  The it's hard to hide news photos of him walking on crutches before and after one of his numerous back surgeries was until 2002
*  When historian Robert Dalek was allowed access to a collection of documents spanning
*  1955 to 1963
*  And 1963 the specifics began to emerge Peyton is co-author neurosurgeon just dr. Justin Doughty
*  Poured over a Dalek subsequent book numerous other biographies and scores of documents and x-rays at the JFK library in Boston prepare their paper
*  So I was taken aback by the depths of Kennedy's pain
*  He said how long he dealt with the pain despite his short life how it affected his life
*  I was able to conceal most of that from the public and certainly from his political adversaries
*  So one of what he would back surgeries were they doing in 1963 good Lord gotta be brutal
*  Oh, it's scarlet fever at age 2 spent his teenage years in and out of hospitals with abdominal and joint pain
*  Fool like symptoms and extreme weight loss
*  age 15 weight a mere 117 pounds
*  By the next year worried he might have leukemia doctors began regularly checking his blood. He was all fucked up, man
*  So he was a sick dude, but so like sometimes I think there's like lightest
*  different explanations that like
*  Aren't that sexy like like here's not sexy look at this yesterday
*  I went through the most harassing experience of my life an iron tube
*  12 inches long and one inch diameter up my ass my poor
*  bedraggled rectum
*  My god is looking at me very reproachfully these days
*  He was great with words bro, he was fucked comic Jesus Christ
*  So you got a football game and got tackled from the side possibly damaging a spinal disc
*  Again regularly using a corset brace to stabilize the spine and control his discomfort
*  So yeah, he was all fucked up, but it's like there's things like when things don't make sense
*  There are sometimes an explanation that's like kind of like almost boring or random
*  It's like the thing was the pruder. I think it's a pruder person puts an umbrella up. Mm-hmm that is a pruder
*  There's a guy who has an umbrella up and it's not raining and for years
*  They thought he might have been involved like signaling. Mm-hmm, and they finally find the guy
*  They bring him in front of everyone and he's like, I'm British and in England
*  It's a real fuck you when you like raise your umbrella when a car like a car is driving by and he hated Kennedy
*  So he's just doing a fuck you but then for years people are like, oh that was part of the signal
*  I just think I mean, I'm not saying some conspiracies are true. I just think there's sometimes other reasons that get that get lost
*  Yeah, for sure. You know, certainly people look for things that aren't there right? No, I've read conspiracies about me. I'm like
*  But it's weird when you read them about you you like oh this is how this works people just make shit up and they just
*  Run with it. What's the one about you? Oh just nonsense being handled by the CIA being a part of the illuminati
*  All kinds of stupid shit throwing people off your trail by being into conspiracy theories
*  So people don't realize you're part of the well, they just want to think you're controlled
*  Yeah, they want us to think that at certain point someone comes to you and you get controlled but that's not real
*  No, the reality is no one's in control. That's that's the right to me. Also the reality is
*  MK ultra was real and they really were trying to teach people how to kill people and they they did it with Charlie Manson
*  No, yeah, I mean, there's definitely real horrible fucked up. I'm not saying that
*  I'm not saying there's not fucked up horrible shit, but I do think no one's really steering the ship and that's like the really scary
*  Right. I think the our idea is that this there's this one
*  Group of people that all agree with each other
*  That's I don't think that's real. I think there's competing factions even at the top levels
*  I think they're always battling with each other. Yes. You look the people in the Navy sometimes don't like the people in the army
*  You know me exactly. This is the CIA
*  Yeah, I
*  That's 100% real and that's why when people look at all of Israelis not to bring it back to the right
*  Right as like a Zionist conspiracy. You're now doing that you're believing in this collective thing when really there's so many different types of Israelis
*  There's extremists. There's racists and there's there's peaceniks. There's people who believe in peace and it's like exactly
*  You I think you always have to be wary of like thinking everything's monolithic
*  Absolutely, and I feel like that about the intelligence agencies as well. I feel like yeah, you want the CIA
*  You want someone who's paying attention to terrorist plots?
*  Of course, you want you want them you want the FBI to be able to investigate when someone's done something horrible
*  Yeah, you've water you want those things
*  You just don't want them out of control and the problem is absolute power corrupts
*  Absolutely, and when some people get into certain positions of power they use whatever means necessary to maintain it
*  I mean the Nazis have the ultimate conspiracy when they invaded Poland
*  They like killed a bunch of their own like prisoner wars and had them dressed as Polish like soldiers and like
*  Concocted a whole fake attack by Poland, of course, I mean the ultimate Hitler burned the Reichstag
*  Yeah, you never know who did it. No. Well, some people actually do think it was the Marxists, but we don't actually know for sure
*  Yeah, I thought it was just generally assumed that it was Hitler. I think there's still some mystery
*  I think some people there was one guy who they say might have lit the fire. I
*  Forget what his name. I read this in a book, but like Hitler definitely jumped on it, right immediately
*  What was the time old tactic? I mean, yeah Nero burned Rome
*  I don't you might have but I think there's still some mystery about what because some people think it might have been someone else
*  But then he just kind of you mean Hitler or Nero?
*  Hitler Nero, you know an else Nero did when his wife died
*  he found some slave boy that looked like his wife and had her castrated and
*  Paraded her around as his wife. Did he fuck? I don't know what he did
*  Probably did I mean imagine he decided you're gonna be my wife now
*  I'm gonna chop your dick off and bring you out in public
*  Well, yeah back then it's a fit and then the kid excited I believe the kid killed himself a couple years later
*  Yeah, see we can find that story. It is a crazy story
*  He found some slave boy that looked like his wife
*  And so, you know back then you're looking at him at the fucking on the balcony
*  You're one of the peasants in the city. Nobody knew. Yeah, just like was his wife anymore
*  Like he didn't want anybody knows wife died. So he decided to make this fucking this slave boy
*  Look like his wife woman who looked like his wife. I don't know if he had a sister. Look this is Nero
*  Caligula this dude was out of his fucking mind. I should know much about Nero
*  Sporus was a young slave boy who the Roman Emperor Nero had castrated and married as his Empress
*  Under his tour of Greece in 66 to 67 CE allegedly in order for him to play the role of his wife
*  Poppaea Sabina who had died the previous year ancient historians generally portray this relationship between Nero and spores as an abomination
*  How do you say that name suit so Tony s so Tony s places his account in the neuro
*  Sporus relationship in his scandalous accounts of Nero sexual aberrations between his raping a vestal virgin and
*  committing incest with his mother
*  Something Nero used his marriage to spores to assuage the guilt he fed
*  He felt for allegedly kicking his pregnant wife Pompeii to death
*  At least you hopefully was really really Jesus Christ Dio Casios in a more detailed account writes
*  It's spores born uncanny resemblance to Poppaea and that Nero called spores by her name. Oh my god
*  That's insane. Oh my god
*  Wow
*  Should make a movie about that kid
*  Oh look at this scholars have deduced that spores was likely an epithet given to him when his abuse started
*  Considering it to be derived from the Greek word spores meaning seed or semen
*  Which may refer to his inability to have children following his castration
*  What the fuck dude? Oh my god
*  How crazy is how crazy was that guy? They should make a movie about that kid
*  That'd be a good movie right kids perspective
*  Five first you do like dark things. That's the darkest first. He has to accept that he may have some girly features
*  Bro make it a rom-com, but it's just like what was society like back then because
*  They all had sex with kids. I fucked a lot of kids fucked a lot of kids
*  It was normal for like an intellectual to have a young boy that he would fuck
*  I think was gay to fuck your wife. I think people would be like I'm going home to my wife
*  They're like, what are you gay? Go fuck a little boy like us. It was like it was like a gay thing to fuck your wife
*  Yeah, it was in fucking kids was like fashion. Well, also, how about the Spartans the greatest warriors ever?
*  They all fucked each other. Yeah, they were it's Greeks were like very tough and very not homophobic
*  They didn't care who they fucked they were just fucking that was that was a part of masculinity like fuck. I was masculine
*  Like you're like, I'm tough. I find that
*  Imagine that kept going and guys are just fucking guys today
*  Well in the Nazis were the guy who was gay Eric
*  I mean, what was name rock general Romer or whatever his name was the one part of the original?
*  SA that they killed in the night of the long knives. Oh really?
*  He was gay and he was the toughest as they came and he was a bunch of gay people in his his division
*  Yeah
*  Well, that's the the ideal of the Spartans was that you would fight for your lover much harder than you'd fight for a friend
*  So like this man. Yeah, this man beside you. Not only is he your you know, come
*  He's he's with you in this war. He's a fellow soldier, but he's also your lover
*  So are you saying I was thinking they wanted to fuck each other
*  Is it more like the general was like I need you all to fuck each other
*  I think they wanted to fuck each other too. They wanted to fuck each other. I think they just got used to fucking guys
*  I think it's probably one of those like guys are so gross. Let's that's the thing about prison, right?
*  There's no women around we just fuck each other. Yeah
*  Spore thing it gets a little weirder. Yes. Yeah, I mean
*  He was already married to someone else after his wife died. Oh, it's at Alina Miss Alina
*  And then later married spores that year who said to bear remarkable resemblance to Pompeo, but then
*  He took spores to Greece and then back to Rome making Calvia
*  Casper Nelia
*  Serve as his mistress of wardrobe to sports to spores
*  Nero then near had earlier married another freedman
*  Pythagoras who had played the role of Nero's husband now spores played the role of Nero's wife. What?
*  Wild Nero died before spores died too. Oh my god. He was just wild and then spores went to somebody else
*  As a wife because it was in
*  Papaya was married to this person before Nero got her and Nero made them get divorced took papaya
*  Wow, I killed her and then spores went back to this guy. Whoa
*  Sabina's oh my god Nympho
*  Who had persuaded the Praetorian Guard to desert Nero?
*  Nymphidias treated spores as a wife and called him Pompeo
*  So called him
*  Nero's ex-wife who Nero kicked to death who he used to be married to
*  What the fuck imagine that poor kid? He just blessed with good genetics got a pretty face
*  Cut your dick off and just fuck you and they pass you around talk like my wife
*  I'm gonna change your name again kid
*  Why killed himself is someone else who beat that guy was gonna use spores as a victim in public entertainment as a
*  reenacted after all that shit of a rape of
*  Someone in the underworld is what that is the rape of prosperity press
*  Prosper Pina the rape of prosper Pina at a gladiator show. Oh my god
*  So he avoided this public humiliation by committing suicide
*  So they were gonna violently rape him and kill him in a gladiator show
*  Finally gets free of the shit and then they're like we want you to reenact it now
*  We're gonna make you die in a gladiator show. I guess that's not the first time they did that
*  He probably knew what was coming. So he's probably like fuck that right?
*  He probably saw so many people get fucked up in glad I didn't need to publicly humiliate him
*  Haven't he been through that? Why kick a man wise down? I just like he's getting a little cocky. Let's uh, oh
*  Life back then I mean this is the thing
*  It's like they thought they were pretty progressive when they're just spanking women. Yeah in those stupid movies. Well, you don't know
*  Yeah, you don't know
*  Was normal yeah, we didn't cut her dick off well, you know, we are we we do move at our own pace and it's like
*  People have act like people suck now like we're awful, but like we are we are getting better
*  We are way better than those days way better than the Nero if you just read that account
*  Yeah, imagine we're proving that magic Biden's wife died
*  So he found some fucking page that looked like his wife had him cut his dick off and brought him to Greece as his wife
*  I'd be like this guy's a maniac
*  Guys out of his fucking we're freaked out when he sniffs hair. Yeah
*  Too close to that. Yeah, look how he's smelling those kids
*  Imagine oh I was saying it was I mean it was good to be a king back then
*  Didn't last long came for you. He got what happened to him. He got executed or what happened in Nero? How did he die?
*  Because of how crazy it's sounding I'm starting to go like maybe whoever killed him was just like, you know
*  We're gonna do a smear him and we're gonna make up all this shit about him
*  It's not maybe accurate, but who's gonna fucking right but the Nero store
*  That's like an historical record the store took spore us. I found a New Yorker article from 2021
*  That says like how nasty was he really?
*  How nasty was Nero really? Oh my god Nero apologies. They're gonna be writing out about Hitler someday
*  It was just the oxycodone. It wasn't Hitler. Yeah. Sorry. It was on really good pot really poaching pot
*  It made him fuck his wife. She was 29% THC was strong and he only had taken weed a couple times
*  Yeah, you can't fault them for killing all the Jews. He really did think they were evil
*  I was tripping balls
*  Kill six million Jews. Well, I was on painkillers
*  Guys I was on a lot of pain at a bad doctor
*  What Jamie we say after he had sex with his mommy killed her too. They didn't mention that. Oh, whoops. Yeah bad guy
*  I'd say bad guy. Yeah. Yeah. I said pretty safe to say that's not a conspiracy
*  I think that guy was probably really bad guy. No, that was a bad guy. Yeah
*  No, he was a duck when you were the king back then you could do whatever the fuck you wanted
*  Which is part of the problem. Yeah, that's so much power over people
*  I think anyone put in that position would just do whatever the fuck they want. You know the Elizabeth Bathory story
*  No, Elizabeth. This so this is a very controversial story to know about this lady
*  Apparent so this this is the folklore. There's two different versions this so the folk the story that gets handed down
*  Was this woman was so evil that she was a serial killer and she was beautiful when she was young and as she got older
*  She would slaughter young maids and put them in a bathtub and and bathe in their blood to try to rejuvenate
*  But then the revisionist approach to it was that they accused her of all these things so that they could take her land and
*  They imprisoned her because she was a royal so they imprisoned her and under house arrest
*  They locked her up in a castle
*  you know the locked her up in a room in the castle for the rest of her life until she died and
*  They think that this could possibly could be false accusations against her that were so horrific that no one would question them
*  So that they could take her land. Oh
*  So she didn't do it or I don't know we don't know miss stories
*  I mean if they did smear her with this fake thing, you know, it's it's a crazy
*  Accusation to you wanted to be true though
*  You want to think there's some lady that is so vain and evil that she slaughters all the beautiful young ladies
*  Yeah, and that they these women started going missing and they said see if you can find that story. It's kind of crazy
*  I used to be super into serial killers like before it was cool. Oh
*  Why did you start?
*  Gotcha first. Well, first of all, I was really into Kemper the guy in the mind hunter series. Oh
*  I wasn't him before now. He's like everyone knows him. I'm a little disappointed. I was into him. He's mainstream now
*  Sold out back when I was into it. I was creeping people. It was cool
*  It's old-school days my favorite stories Ed Gein
*  Mmm, there's a story that someone came to like to his house once to like get borrow sugar or some shit
*  And he came inside and there was a skull that Ed Gein of someone who had killed like on a shelf and the guy's like
*  What the fuck is that and Ed Gein, you know, it's like 50s, right? I can just kind of like freaks out and just lies
*  He just goes. Oh, that's a Japanese guy killed in the war brought him back and the guys the other guys like
*  Thank God for a second I thought of something creepy
*  That is crazy imagine you could take a Japanese guys head home with you and everyone just like yeah
*  It's fine
*  Well, it's a Japanese guy case of Elizabeth Bathory inspired numerous stories during the 18th and 19th century's most common motif of these works
*  That the countless bathing in her victims virgin victims blood to retain beauty or youth
*  The legend appeared in print for the first time in 1729 in the Jesuit scholar
*  Laszlo
*  Turok see Turok see maybe
*  Tragica Historia was written the first account of the Bathory case story came into question
*  1817 when the witness accounts which had resurfaced in 1765 were published for the first time
*  They included no references to blood baths in his book Hungary and Transylvania published in 1850
*  John Paget
*  Describes the supposed origins of Bathory's blood bathing although his tale seems to be fictionalized
