*  Huh? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=140.0s)]
*  I felt like you belonged at that place. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=141.0s)]
*  Like immediately, the moment you went on stage, we were in the balcony watching you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=143.0s)]
*  I was crying. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=147.0s)]

*  You're like dude, you've got to go slow. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=162.0s)]
*  It's repetition. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=164.0s)]
*  Wap, wap, wap. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=165.0s)]
*  And then wap, wap, wap. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=166.0s)]
*  And then you start going, ba-da-da-da. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=167.0s)]
*  And then you go, stay right here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=169.0s)]

*  But I, I gotta say. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=185.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of those guys are getting into martial arts. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=186.0s)]
*  Huh? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=188.0s)]
*  It's a lot of those guys are getting into martial arts. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=189.0s)]
*  You know, because like guys are trying jiu-jitsu. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=191.0s)]
*  It's, it's really interesting because it's like they're realizing like there's something to that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=193.0s)]
*  There's something to doing that thing, that very difficult physical thing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=198.0s)]
*  It makes you better at other stuff. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=201.0s)]
*  I want to do it and I didn't commit to it yet because I know. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=203.0s)]
*  Just go with Joey. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=206.0s)]

*  Joey Diaz? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=209.0s)]
*  He does jiu-jitsu all the time. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=210.0s)]
*  But he's in Jersey, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=211.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're not in Jersey anymore. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=212.0s)]
*  You're in Florida now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=214.0s)]
*  There's plenty of places in Florida I could say. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=215.0s)]
*  There is plenty. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=216.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=217.0s)]
*  Florida is filled with like high level jiu-jitsu. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=218.0s)]
*  But what I was going to say was, it's, knowing what you're capable of. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=220.0s)]
*  Definitely, definitely adds to everything about you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=227.0s)]
*  The way your whole day goes about. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=231.0s)]
*  Like it creates a fearless, if that makes sense. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=233.0s)]
*  Well, it's just like it gives you more of an understanding of other stuff. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=237.0s)]
*  Like if you get good, it's a thing that's hard to do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=240.0s)]
*  It gives you a better understanding of how to get good at other stuff. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=243.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=245.0s)]
*  I just think even life and just life in general. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=246.0s)]
*  Having a difficult thing that you do in your life, I think makes the rest of life easier. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=249.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=254.0s)]
*  I think we're just, humans are so adaptable, man. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=255.0s)]
*  You look at people that live in horrible conditions and they seem fine. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=258.0s)]
*  Like you ever see like these videos of these villages where these kids are playing and there's just dirt. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=261.0s)]
*  There's nothing else and they're just kicking around a homemade soccer ball, laughing and giggling. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=266.0s)]
*  Joe, so two years ago, we go on a big vacation, right? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=271.0s)]
*  I like going to Africa. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=276.0s)]
*  And we go to this tribe. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=278.0s)]
*  What part of Africa did you go? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=281.0s)]
*  This one was in Kenya. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=283.0s)]
*  It was right outside of Kenya. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=284.0s)]
*  You flew into Nairobi. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=286.0s)]
*  It was just outside of Kenya. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=287.0s)]
*  But you remember when you were a kid and you build a fort. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=289.0s)]
*  Like me and you were hanging out with 12-year-old, 12-year-old, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=294.0s)]
*  and they were like, oh, you want to build a fort? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=297.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=298.0s)]
*  You're going to end up getting like, okay, I got a trash can. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=299.0s)]
*  I got my dad's jacket. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=303.0s)]
*  I got the hood of a car. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=305.0s)]
*  And we love. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=307.0s)]
*  And then once you build a fort, then you're inside and you're like, this is where we're going to cook. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=308.0s)]
*  Dude, that's what these guys lived in. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=312.0s)]
*  And they loved it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=315.0s)]
*  It was like watching kids play fort. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=318.0s)]
*  And they were just so proud. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=320.0s)]
*  I went in. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=321.0s)]
*  I'll show you a picture later. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=322.0s)]
*  It's so fucking cool. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=324.0s)]
*  You go in and they that's all they got. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=325.0s)]
*  And I think that when you say that's all they got, it's a misconception. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=328.0s)]
*  Yeah, they exist just like we exist. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=333.0s)]
*  Like they're alive and thriving, just like we're alive and thriving. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=336.0s)]
*  It's just a completely different way of living. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=339.0s)]
*  A hunter gatherers way of living. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=341.0s)]
*  Apparently, when you talk to and I'm not talking about like, let's be real clear. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=343.0s)]
*  I'm not talking about like third world people who live in like rural poverty. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=348.0s)]
*  I'm talking about hunter gatherers. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=353.0s)]
*  I'm talking about people that exist off the land. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=355.0s)]
*  There's something about that they think resonates with people because that's how we evolved. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=357.0s)]
*  And so when people do that, they're very happy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=364.0s)]
*  They had a really interesting docu series on vice back in the day called Hindmo's Arctic Adventure. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=366.0s)]
*  And it's about this guy, Hindmo Korth. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=373.0s)]
*  I hope I'm saying his name right. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=375.0s)]
*  I think I am. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=377.0s)]
*  And this dude moved up to the Arctic in like the 1970s. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=378.0s)]
*  And he's been there ever since. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=386.0s)]
*  This dude doesn't have a tell. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=388.0s)]
*  He's got a TV with like VHS tapes and he watches movies occasionally. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=389.0s)]
*  He saw about 9 11. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=393.0s)]
*  He saw a photo of 9 11. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=395.0s)]
*  He's still never seen the planes go into the towers. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=396.0s)]
*  And this guy moved up there and met this woman, this indigenous woman, and had a family with her. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=399.0s)]
*  And it's in this fucking guy lives in like a log house that's in the middle of the woods. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=407.0s)]
*  And he's surrounded by grizzly bears. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=413.0s)]
*  He had to kill a grizzly bear on camera in the middle of this thing. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=415.0s)]
*  The grizzly bear was coming to kill his dog or eat his caribou or something. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=419.0s)]
*  He's killed one of his dogs in the past. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=423.0s)]
*  Like you have your dogs tied up outside to bark to make sure that they know when bears are coming. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=425.0s)]
*  And a bear ate his fucking dog. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=430.0s)]
*  The dog was tied up. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=432.0s)]
*  They came back. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=433.0s)]
*  The dog was dead or just pieces of it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=434.0s)]
*  Like in this guy lives like this and he's so happy, but he's also super intelligent. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=436.0s)]
*  So when this guy is talking, he's explaining how I think this is how people are supposed to live. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=442.0s)]
*  Well, not only that too, but knowing that your life or any life can end at any moment, at any time. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=447.0s)]
*  I think when you have a reality that just how delicate all of life is, you have a different perception. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=456.0s)]
*  And you take and you look at things a lot differently. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=465.0s)]
*  Like you lose someone, you truly look. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=468.0s)]
*  This fucker knows all of them are vulnerable. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=470.0s)]
*  He lost his baby. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=474.0s)]
*  He lost a two year old baby. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=476.0s)]
*  It fell out of their boat in the rapids. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=477.0s)]
*  I mean, this is how difficult their life is that they're forced to hold a two year old baby in the rapids. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=481.0s)]
*  There's no other way to do it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=488.0s)]
*  They have to get through. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=490.0s)]
*  So everyone has to survive. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=492.0s)]
*  It's like the thing tipped over. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=494.0s)]
*  It's like, well, and we live in our world where a two year old gets cancer. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=496.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=501.0s)]
*  You watch that kid go through things and have 10, 15 operations. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=502.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=507.0s)]
*  And then you finally lose them. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=508.0s)]
*  It's life. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=510.0s)]
*  That's the part. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=511.0s)]
*  Like doesn't matter. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=512.0s)]
*  Part of me wants to go back to that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=514.0s)]
*  I know it's going to be a battle, but there is part of me that feels like this should be the new school. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=517.0s)]
*  But is there is there a mix between living that way and like, hey, man, let's go get some let's go get some pizza and burgers. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=523.0s)]
*  Let's go see a fucking movie. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=531.0s)]
*  Or let's go see. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=533.0s)]
*  And we have to get to not so here is there because I like that's the new school learning how to build a home. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=534.0s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=542.0s)]
*  Learning how to live off the land. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=543.0s)]
*  Did you know what I saw that was fascinating the other day? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=545.0s)]
*  They took apart this one hundred plus year old Japanese building that was made with no nails. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=548.0s)]
*  The craftsmanship is so insane. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=557.0s)]
*  They have these wood cuts where they wedge into each other perfectly. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=560.0s)]
*  And then they have a separate wedge that they put in each piece to secure it in place. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=565.0s)]
*  And they built this house this way with no nails over a hundred years ago. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=570.0s)]
*  Is this like the log cabin thing to where you know, but it's not like a log. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=575.0s)]
*  It's like perfect. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=579.0s)]
*  Like a log cabin is kind of rough. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=581.0s)]
*  You know, like they do that and they make those cuts and they slide them in place. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=583.0s)]
*  But it's a little rough. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=586.0s)]
*  I'm talking about like this precision thin cuts on wood where they mesh together perfectly. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=587.0s)]
*  I saw this. I saw a complete opposite where they built into the ground. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=593.0s)]
*  And I don't know if it was like India or whatever. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=598.0s)]
*  They had brown skin and they built this most incredible underground bedroom just from digging and placing things over certain areas. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=603.0s)]
*  So they just went into a mountain side. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=615.0s)]
*  It wasn't even a mountain side. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=617.0s)]
*  The hillside? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=619.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=620.0s)]
*  They went into the ground? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=621.0s)]
*  Like a hobbit house. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=622.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=623.0s)]
*  It was so cool. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=624.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is it. Look at how they did this. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=626.0s)]
*  This is the Japanese construction. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=628.0s)]
*  Isn't that insane? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=630.0s)]
*  Look how they made these fucking perfect cut wedges and they just slide into each other. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=632.0s)]
*  And they had this whole building built like this. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=638.0s)]
*  There's no nails. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=640.0s)]
*  And it existed like this perfectly for 100 years. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=642.0s)]
*  So they're deconstructing it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=647.0s)]
*  I'm hoping that they're going to reconstruct it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=649.0s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=651.0s)]
*  So how old is this thing? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=653.0s)]
*  Over 100 years old, I believe. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=655.0s)]
*  100 years ago. Yeah. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=657.0s)]
*  It's joinery. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=658.0s)]
*  When I was looking it up, it says that that's how they did construction in Japan back then. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=660.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=664.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of videos showing this stuff. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=665.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=666.0s)]
*  Because it's not like they didn't have nails back then. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=667.0s)]
*  But what's fascinating about someone who's willing to commit to building stuff like this is like this is engineering. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=670.0s)]
*  This is art. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=678.0s)]
*  This is architecture. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=679.0s)]
*  I mean, these guys look at how they're doing this, man, when they're making all these things slide into each other insecure in place with wedges. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=681.0s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=688.0s)]
*  They said they're bug repellent to treat it with treated with bug repellent. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=690.0s)]
*  It probably gives you cancer. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=694.0s)]
*  We're going to bug repellent. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=696.0s)]
*  That stuff's so nasty. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=697.0s)]
*  When I did construction, I used to have to carry pressure treated lumber. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=698.0s)]
*  And it was a grunt and pressure treated lumber. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=701.0s)]
*  You get splinters in you and you're basically getting inoculated. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=705.0s)]
*  So chemical. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=709.0s)]
*  What the fuck is pressure treated lumber pressure treated with? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=711.0s)]
*  It does. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=714.0s)]
*  It smells terrible. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=715.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=716.0s)]
*  We have to have to care. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=717.0s)]
*  I did one job that I had during the summer with my friend Jimmy Lawless. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=718.0s)]
*  He got me a job working for his construction company. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=722.0s)]
*  And Jimmy was a carpenter at the time and I was a laborer. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=725.0s)]
*  And we had to build a Knights of Columbus ramp. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=727.0s)]
*  And it was just carrying pressure treated lumber and cement all day. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=730.0s)]
*  Dude, I did two weeks. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=734.0s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=737.0s)]
*  I guess I was 18. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=738.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=739.0s)]
*  Somewhere around 18. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=740.0s)]
*  It's the last thing you want to be doing. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=741.0s)]
*  I was like, fuck this. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=742.0s)]
*  Because I had like entertained some romantic ideas of going into construction. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=744.0s)]
*  You know, be like a good thing. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=748.0s)]
*  But I wasn't interested in it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=750.0s)]
*  You know, I was like, I did a lot of construction gigs because my stepdad was an architect. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=752.0s)]
*  So I was always on construction sites when I was a kid. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=756.0s)]
*  But that is fucking hard work, man. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=759.0s)]
*  Dude, that's a whole different level of work. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=762.0s)]
*  That is, you're getting up early. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=764.0s)]
*  You're using every muscle in your body. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=766.0s)]
*  I did that for like three days tops, I think. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=769.0s)]
*  I'm not even kidding. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=772.0s)]
*  What happened to me was he goes, you know, we're working on this whatever building, whatever it was. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=774.0s)]
*  I'm petrified of heights. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=781.0s)]
*  So I was fine on the ground gathering things and bringing shit. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=783.0s)]
*  But when he was like, OK, take this screw gun and then you're going to go up the scaffold and fucking. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=787.0s)]
*  What? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=794.0s)]
*  Yeah, no harness. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=795.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=797.0s)]
*  No nothing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=798.0s)]
*  No nothing. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=799.0s)]
*  Just climb that thing. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=800.0s)]
*  So I stood there. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=801.0s)]
*  I stood there. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=803.0s)]
*  And every time he was looking, it looked like, and then he caught on like 50. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=804.0s)]
*  He's like, Brew, you haven't even, kid, you haven't even gotten one in. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=808.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, fuck. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=812.0s)]
*  And then he calls you out. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=813.0s)]
*  You afraid of heights? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=815.0s)]
*  Are you fucking serious right now? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=816.0s)]
*  Are you afraid of dying? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=818.0s)]
*  Joe, you bring this guy who's afraid of fucking heights? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=819.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=822.0s)]
*  That's called being intelligent. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=823.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=824.0s)]
*  You're supposed to be afraid of heights. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=825.0s)]
*  Petrified. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=826.0s)]
*  Petrified. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=827.0s)]
*  Dude, when I watch those Alex Honnold videos, that guy climbing the mountains, where it's like at this angle, he's like literally hanging on with his fingers and toes, crawling his way thousands of feet above the rocks. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=828.0s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=840.0s)]
*  What about the guys in the buildings? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=841.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=843.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=844.0s)]
*  Like buildings. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=845.0s)]
*  James Kingston sent me this. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=846.0s)]
*  This is him. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=847.0s)]
*  Like this crazy fucker. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=848.0s)]
*  This crazy fucker. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=850.0s)]
*  Look what he's doing, man. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=851.0s)]
*  This is not good. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=853.0s)]
*  Like, look at this way he's got to climb this thing. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=854.0s)]
*  Oh my. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=857.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=860.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing, bro? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=861.0s)]
*  And he's barefoot. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=864.0s)]
*  My feet would be so sweaty. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=865.0s)]
*  I would be slipping and sliding all over the place. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=867.0s)]
*  He just got to the top and he didn't even know what was going to happen. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=869.0s)]
*  He's like, how do I do this? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=871.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=872.0s)]
*  He's fucking stuck. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=873.0s)]
*  What? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=874.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=875.0s)]
*  I can't let him do that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=876.0s)]
*  Take it away. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=878.0s)]
*  Take it away. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=879.0s)]
*  Take it away. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=880.0s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=881.0s)]
*  So that's called being intelligent, though. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=882.0s)]
*  So I remember one time I was with my kids. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=884.0s)]
*  I'm with the family. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=887.0s)]
*  And we go, and the kids really want to go on this Ferris wheel. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=888.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=892.0s)]
*  But I think, I don't remember where it was. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=893.0s)]
*  I don't know where it was. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=896.0s)]
*  It was definitely in the, maybe it's Canada. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=897.0s)]
*  It doesn't fucking matter. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=900.0s)]
*  All I know is you're in a cage and this one goes really high, really high. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=901.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=908.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=909.0s)]
*  So I'm like, you know what, the kids, this one's seven. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=910.0s)]
*  That would be cool. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=913.0s)]
*  We got in. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=914.0s)]
*  I don't think I made it to halfway. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=916.0s)]
*  And then they started with the shaking and the fucking shaking. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=918.0s)]
*  And I was so scared, I threatened my child's life. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=923.0s)]
*  I told them I was going to punch their fucking faces. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=929.0s)]
*  I swear to God, I'm screaming going, I will punch your fucking face in right now. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=934.0s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=941.0s)]
*  And my wife's like, damn, stop. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=942.0s)]
*  And that was it, man. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=944.0s)]
*  That was it. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=945.0s)]
*  Shut my eyes. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=946.0s)]
*  I'm never tempting heights ever again in my life. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=947.0s)]
*  I don't need to. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=950.0s)]
*  I'm 55. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=951.0s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=952.0s)]
*  I'm fucking done. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=953.0s)]
*  It's not necessary. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=954.0s)]
*  It's not necessary. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=955.0s)]
*  I don't need it. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=956.0s)]
*  You're having a job where you literally risk your life climbing scaffoldings and hanging [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=957.0s)]
*  on where you're screwing things in. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=961.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=962.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=963.0s)]
*  It's hard work, man. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=964.0s)]
*  That's man shit. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=965.0s)]
*  Shout out to all the construction workers out there listening to this. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=966.0s)]
*  That's man stuff. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=969.0s)]
*  That's real work. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=970.0s)]
*  That's man stuff. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=971.0s)]
*  That taught me, that was like one of the most important things about me becoming a comedian. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=972.0s)]
*  Having like really hard labor jobs and realizing like, I don't want to do this. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=976.0s)]
*  I got to figure something out. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=981.0s)]
*  No. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=983.0s)]
*  My dad was sanitation. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=984.0s)]
*  I'd watch him. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=985.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know if I can, you know, I watch people working all day. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=986.0s)]
*  I don't know if I can do this. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=993.0s)]
*  Also, imagine if you're doing sanitation and you're grabbing garbage cans and you throw [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=995.0s)]
*  them in. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1000.0s)]
*  What are you smelling all day? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1001.0s)]
*  What are you smelling all day? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1003.0s)]
*  And how can that not be bad for you? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1005.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1007.0s)]
*  Toxic fumes, if you work in a factory, you have to have fucking the respirator thing [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1008.0s)]
*  on and the masks. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1012.0s)]
*  How is that okay that these garbage men are just breathing in toxic fumes all day? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1015.0s)]
*  If you can smell it, that means it's getting in your body. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1021.0s)]
*  And they were all like, his whole crew were all World War II guys. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1024.0s)]
*  So they all came back. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1028.0s)]
*  They all just came back from that. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1029.0s)]
*  They all hook each other up. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1030.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1031.0s)]
*  And they all got jobs doing that. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1032.0s)]
*  Solid job. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1033.0s)]
*  Solid job. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1034.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe they don't smell too much. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1035.0s)]
*  Maybe the way they do it now. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1037.0s)]
*  He'd come home smelling like pure ass. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1038.0s)]
*  Ass of dogs. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1041.0s)]
*  It was horrifying. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1042.0s)]
*  There's certain jobs where like, Jesus Christ, like how do you protect people like that in [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1043.0s)]
*  a pandemic? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1049.0s)]
*  Like you can't stop them from working. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1050.0s)]
*  They just say, isn't it funny that like certain people were allowed to keep working? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1052.0s)]
*  Don't get me started. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1057.0s)]
*  Well, as weird as like they had jobs that were deemed critical. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1059.0s)]
*  That was my favorite. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1063.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1064.0s)]
*  So we will tell you what jobs are essential. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1065.0s)]
*  What was essential? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1068.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1069.0s)]
*  So that meant if you were non-essential, like you didn't contribute to society, you were [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1070.0s)]
*  non-essential. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1075.0s)]
*  We will decide who is essential. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1076.0s)]
*  The weird thing is that podcasting was essential. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1078.0s)]
*  It was very essential. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1081.0s)]
*  But it was. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1082.0s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1083.0s)]
*  It was listed as. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1084.0s)]
*  Because it's entertainment. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1086.0s)]
*  The show must go on. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1087.0s)]
*  The show must go on. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1088.0s)]
*  The people need to be entertained. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1089.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, we didn't know we were part of the sub show. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1091.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were part of a weird show. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1093.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1095.0s)]
*  I remember the early days like Dana White wanted to put on an event and they were saying, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1096.0s)]
*  no, you can't have events anymore. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1104.0s)]
*  Because of COVID? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1106.0s)]
*  Yeah, because of COVID. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1107.0s)]
*  It was like, shut the fuck up. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1108.0s)]
*  I'm going to find a place for this. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1109.0s)]
*  And then eventually we wound up doing it indoors with no audience. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1110.0s)]
*  Eventually, it was a few months in, they wound up doing, we did a show in Jacksonville, I [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1115.0s)]
*  believe. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1120.0s)]
*  It was definitely Florida. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1121.0s)]
*  I think it was Jacksonville. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1122.0s)]
*  And no audience in an arena. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1123.0s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1126.0s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1127.0s)]
*  It was weird because it was a big ass arena. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1128.0s)]
*  And there's just us and everybody's weirded out. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1131.0s)]
*  Such a small amount of people. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1135.0s)]
*  And everybody's like, are we going to die? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1137.0s)]
*  Like, is this like, what the fuck is this? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1139.0s)]
*  It was like the early days of the pandemic. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1141.0s)]
*  Everybody was still really weirded out by it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1142.0s)]
*  You know, it was very frustrating for me because I just came off of the impractical Joker cruise. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1144.0s)]
*  I just toured. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1156.0s)]
*  I left Metallica and then did my own tour. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1157.0s)]
*  So all I thought about was, okay, all those tours that were out there, all those bands, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1160.0s)]
*  thousands of bands are touring everywhere. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1168.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden, in March, you're like, everything's shut. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1172.0s)]
*  But up until February, you had thousands of different bands. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1175.0s)]
*  All the meet and greets, all the hotels, all the airlines, all the partying. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1179.0s)]
*  And no one out of that, you never heard anyone dying. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1186.0s)]
*  And I saw, I would do meet and greets, have people come up to me. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1191.0s)]
*  I didn't know anyone dying. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1195.0s)]
*  And I'm not saying people didn't die. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1197.0s)]
*  We're not saying that because they get pissed. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1199.0s)]
*  There's someone right now going, are you saying someone died? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1201.0s)]
*  No, dude, it's not what I'm saying. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1205.0s)]
*  You want to hear the most fucked up statistic that I've heard recently? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1206.0s)]
*  74% of hospitalizations and deaths could have been prevented. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1209.0s)]
*  Is it 74% of the number with vitamin D? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1213.0s)]
*  If people had adequate levels of vitamin D. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1216.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's real, but I read this whole report on it. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1219.0s)]
*  And I was like, if that number is real, and they knew that vitamin D was essential to fighting off diseases, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1223.0s)]
*  if they knew that it was essential to the immune system, and they didn't tell everybody, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1230.0s)]
*  they didn't just scream it from the rooftops, hey, there's this cheap thing that you can get. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1234.0s)]
*  And it really protects you. It helps you a lot. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1238.0s)]
*  It's great for you. It's actually a hormone, right? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1241.0s)]
*  And it's great for you. You should go out in the sun and get it naturally if you can. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1243.0s)]
*  But if you can't, you need to get some of this vitamin D. It's really going to help you. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1247.0s)]
*  Bro, when... [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1251.0s)]
*  And I would tell everyone, I would get into a bit... [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1254.0s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1257.0s)]
*  I just got in it with a friend and, you know, peepee and love. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1259.0s)]
*  And the example of when you got sick, right? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1265.0s)]
*  And then you come on and you say, hey, this is what I did and blah, blah, blah. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1269.0s)]
*  And hey, it helped me, right? That's all you did. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1274.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1277.0s)]
*  Now, it's such an... [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1278.0s)]
*  It's how nobody sees that moment. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1281.0s)]
*  If the world is in such utter despair from a disease or whatever you want to... [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1285.0s)]
*  It's killing everyone. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1292.0s)]
*  Now, let's say it wasn't that. We didn't have the news. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1294.0s)]
*  You just heard people go, oh, my God, everyone's dying. Everyone's dying. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1298.0s)]
*  And you're like, well, what do we got to do about it? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1301.0s)]
*  You have to get a shot in the neck. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1303.0s)]
*  You got to get the shot. Well, is there any other? No, there's no... [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1306.0s)]
*  And then out of nowhere, someone goes, hey, man, I ate this plant. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1310.0s)]
*  I ate this plant. I'm not saying no. I'm just telling you. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1314.0s)]
*  I ate this plant and it was this berry. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1317.0s)]
*  Actually, it kind of tasted normal. I ate the berry. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1319.0s)]
*  And then I did like ten jumping jacks and fucking stood out in the sun for an hour. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1321.0s)]
*  And I don't know which of the river, but it helped. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1325.0s)]
*  You think one person will go, whoa, what did you do? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1327.0s)]
*  Not one human being. And when you saw the vicious attack... [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1332.0s)]
*  Well, it was a coordinated response. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1339.0s)]
*  It's very clear why they did it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1341.0s)]
*  They did it because I said that I got better and I wasn't vaccinated. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1343.0s)]
*  Dude. I got better quick. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1347.0s)]
*  And they were mad. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1349.0s)]
*  So the best thing they did, the dumbest thing they did was say I took veterinary medicine. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1350.0s)]
*  When they're talking about a drug that is in the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1354.0s)]
*  it's like they've had billions of prescriptions, not like a hundred thousand, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1361.0s)]
*  like billions of prescriptions of ivermectin. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1365.0s)]
*  I got so pissed at some of my heroes. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1368.0s)]
*  Like, you know, Terry Bradshaw, sorry to bring up his name. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1370.0s)]
*  I can't look at him anymore. I can't look at him anymore. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1373.0s)]
*  He's on Fox, NFL, and he's like, let's face it, they're horse pills. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1376.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, dude, they bought you two? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1385.0s)]
*  He just didn't know. He doesn't know. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1387.0s)]
*  He's probably one of those guys that scared of the disease. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1389.0s)]
*  He's an older guy and they have a heightened level of anxiety when it comes to this. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1391.0s)]
*  And they think that people are being irresponsible. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1396.0s)]
*  That's what they really believe. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1398.0s)]
*  He just is misinformed. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1400.0s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1402.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1403.0s)]
*  He just didn't know that this narrative that there's only one way to deal with this and that this way is actually going to stop it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1404.0s)]
*  Well, if it is going to stop it, why do you care who gets it? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1412.0s)]
*  You should just get it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1414.0s)]
*  Because if you get it, that means that no one else is going to get it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1415.0s)]
*  You're never going to get it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1417.0s)]
*  Everybody who gets the shot is never going to get it. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1418.0s)]
*  That was the narrative. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1420.0s)]
*  That was a lie from the beginning. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1421.0s)]
*  And now we're realizing that it was a lie. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1423.0s)]
*  Everybody realizes it was a lie now. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1424.0s)]
*  I was talking to someone last night that had COVID really fucking bad after being vaccinated. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1426.0s)]
*  Like really bad. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1432.0s)]
*  Two weeks wrecked. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1434.0s)]
*  So I have a great friend and his daughter, college, gets the shot. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1435.0s)]
*  She ends up in the emergency room. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1449.0s)]
*  And she's got blood clots on her liver. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1453.0s)]
*  And they're all like, you know, what do you think? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1458.0s)]
*  Well, you know, she she rose a lot on the row team. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1461.0s)]
*  And are you are you really you're really going to believe that's what it was? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1465.0s)]
*  Well, people do anything to not blame it on the vaccine. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1471.0s)]
*  Like when there's an injury, like people want to find all sorts of other reasons. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1475.0s)]
*  If there was any other thing that came along that was a new novel remedy for things, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1479.0s)]
*  and then there was this host of side effects that were attached to it, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1485.0s)]
*  people would want to be investigating those side effects. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1489.0s)]
*  But because this thing came along during the pandemic and what Robert Malone talks about, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1491.0s)]
*  where you have one solution that's presented to a problem that's isolating society, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1497.0s)]
*  people are literally trapped and this one thing is offered up as a solution. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1504.0s)]
*  And anything that's opposing that gets attacked because everybody does the work of the propaganda machine. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1509.0s)]
*  The regular people do that work because they genuinely believe that you're a knucklehead. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1515.0s)]
*  If you don't go and get vaccinated and you're going to fuck this up for everybody and we're never going to get back to work. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1521.0s)]
*  So they have that in their head. And that's their narrative. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1526.0s)]
*  He just never looked. He's an old guy. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1528.0s)]
*  He probably wasn't looking into it and he really thought that he was probably doing the right thing, encouraging people to go get it. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1530.0s)]
*  I will. I get that. I totally get that 100%. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1537.0s)]
*  But I feel like people like him and everyone that have been out there, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1543.0s)]
*  even the ones that believed everything and that's OK because they get scared and I get it. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1552.0s)]
*  There's still ladies on air. There's still mask on planes. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1558.0s)]
*  You can tell they're scared. They're scared. They got them. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1563.0s)]
*  But they need to understand. It's like when you do when you get when you're humbled. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1567.0s)]
*  Hey, man, I might have been maybe I shouldn't have said that. Yeah, it's all cool. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1574.0s)]
*  I don't. But I guess by their actions, I still feel it. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1579.0s)]
*  But what what makes me crazy is isn't that a well orchestrated, marketed, funded way to murder? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1582.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, like to purposely keep people from getting healthy and actually stopping people. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1595.0s)]
*  What if your if your mother that you. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1606.0s)]
*  That's your angel in your life. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1611.0s)]
*  And what's being forced and threatened and ridiculed and shamed? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1616.0s)]
*  Is that child or that husband? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1624.0s)]
*  And they do it. And the people that created all this, let's not pretend they don't exist. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1628.0s)]
*  The people that created this, they knew exactly what they were doing because they planned this in steps. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1635.0s)]
*  You're not that smart to pull this off without really putting a lot of logic into this. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1642.0s)]
*  And to me, that's murder. I don't know how you explain it in any other way. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1647.0s)]
*  Well, what gets really creepy is if they're ignoring evidence on certain things that could be beneficial [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1651.0s)]
*  because those things are not going to earn the money because then you lose all trust in them because like all you're offering up is a pharmaceutical remedy for whatever the situation is. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1662.0s)]
*  You're not saying that there's any other things that can help when we know that human bodies, there's a lot of things going on, man. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1672.0s)]
*  And your nutrient levels are very important. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1679.0s)]
*  Your metabolic health is very important for your immune system. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1682.0s)]
*  All those things are connected and together. And to think that the way to fix that is only an injection. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1686.0s)]
*  Says who? And why are we listening to people that say that? Anybody that says that is crazy. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1693.0s)]
*  The whole thing is important. All of your health is important. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1700.0s)]
*  We should be encouraging people to be fit and healthy and to make healthy food choices and to take supplements and to exercise regularly and to meditate. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1704.0s)]
*  All those things are as good as medicine. If what you could get from being healthy was available in a medicine, it would be the most popular medicine in the fucking world. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1715.0s)]
*  If you what you could get from being a fit, healthy, happy person, holy shit, would that be a valuable medicine. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1727.0s)]
*  And you can get it for free. That's that's available. You just got to do it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1734.0s)]
*  And they don't tell you that because they don't really give a fuck about your health. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1739.0s)]
*  They give a fuck about you following the rules. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1743.0s)]
*  And if you follow the rules, especially in pertaining to this one, then they make a fuckload of money and they have no accountability. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1746.0s)]
*  And that's what it is. It's unbelievable. That's what it is. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1755.0s)]
*  And so when someone like me says, hey, I got better real quick, they're like, oh, you fucking idiot. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1758.0s)]
*  You're taking a horse dewormer. They're all saying it on CNN. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1763.0s)]
*  So CNN lies. Now, you know, they lie because they knew I wasn't taking veterinary medicine. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1766.0s)]
*  They knew that the guy who invented it literally won the Nobel Prize. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1771.0s)]
*  It's so dumb. That's one of the dumbest checkers move ever. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1775.0s)]
*  It's you know what it is. It's like playing chess and you just run your king out to the middle of the table. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1779.0s)]
*  Fuck you, man. You're taking horse medicine. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1785.0s)]
*  We're just going to repeat it over and over again. No one's going to know the difference. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1789.0s)]
*  No one's going to research the billions of human prescriptions. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1793.0s)]
*  The fact that it's an antiviral, that it stops viral replication in vitro, that there's studies on it. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1798.0s)]
*  The fact that it stops yellow fever. It's not people get all these parasites. It kills them. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1805.0s)]
*  You're so stupid. Oh, my God. It was one of the dumbest things. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1810.0s)]
*  How could anyone ever trust them now when you know that this is how they treat something as so easily provable of being false? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1814.0s)]
*  And what doesn't make any sense like the attack literally makes no sense. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1823.0s)]
*  You should be asking, hey, how did you get better so quick? Exactly. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1827.0s)]
*  And I got the hard one, supposedly. That's the Delta. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1831.0s)]
*  Like, how did you get better so quick? That is common sense. Common sense. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1834.0s)]
*  But how did they create this? Because this one narrative thing, the thing that Dr. Malone talked about, instead of saying, oh, oh, what kind of life choices is he making? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1840.0s)]
*  What medicines did he take? What are monoclonal antibodies? What is IV vitamins? How does that help when you're sick? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1849.0s)]
*  You know, can you take that when you're normal sick? Or is it just COVID that it helps? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1855.0s)]
*  Like IV zinc, IV vitamin C and D and B. All that shit is fucking amazing for you. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1859.0s)]
*  Do you think that enough people realized, because that's the thing, if you're just hanging out with someone, if you're hanging out with me, and eventually I start lying to you all the time, are you going to take anything I say seriously? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1866.0s)]
*  Right. It's over. Who in your life do you know that lies all the time that you take seriously? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1879.0s)]
*  You know what it's like? The corporations, we want to think of them as being these impossibly large machines that make money. And they are. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1884.0s)]
*  But they're just run by people. And some people are dorks. And those dorks get important jobs and they put Dylan Mulvaney on a Bud Light can. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1913.0s)]
*  That's what it is. These are dorks. And you see the response that Bud had, the most recent response? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1928.0s)]
*  It's like the fucking dumbest pro-America rah-rah. Like we don't know who you really are now. There's like interviews with the lady who is the head of Bud Light talking about why they did it and about the old sort of frat culture attached to Bud Light, dismissing the people and the humor of the people that like Bud Light. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1935.0s)]
*  And so they're going to change that with this crazy attention whore on day 365 of being a woman. I mean we are in a fucking Coen Brothers movie. This is a Mike Judge movie. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1958.0s)]
*  You're a thousand percent correct. How does nobody else see what lunacy is going on right now? There's no other way to explain it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1971.0s)]
*  Bro you gotta watch this Bud Light commercial. This new Bud Light commercial. Find the new Bud Light commercial. It's the dumbest pro-America rah-rah. It's so stupid and cliche. It fucking hurts my feelings. It's so dumb. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1980.0s)]
*  Listen to this. This is a company in deep shit bro. And they make things like this. Look you got the prairies, the ocean, you got a Clydesdale running down the street. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=1993.0s)]
*  Rooted in the heart of America. Found in a community where a handshake is a sure contract. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2010.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2020.0s)]
*  Rooted for those who found the opportunity and challenge. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2022.0s)]
*  You know I would respect them if they had this and then Dylan Mulvaney just starts cartwheeling it to the frame. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2025.0s)]
*  Day 368 of womanhood. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2033.0s)]
*  This is when some CEO is like, who is in charge? He's 90 years old. Get him. This is how we used to do it. You need the goddamn Clydesdales first of all. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2035.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Now I hate you more. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2052.0s)]
*  What are you doing? What is that? What was that? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2058.0s)]
*  You can't come out in chicks clothes and turn around and bring a stallion out. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2063.0s)]
*  Well the problem is, if you let CEOs talk about stuff like that and give their opinions about stuff like that, then everybody knows who you are. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2069.0s)]
*  So you can't just make this commercial. Where is this coming from? Was this AI generated? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2079.0s)]
*  That's probably a chat GPT 4.0 version of the perfect American commercial. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2084.0s)]
*  That shit didn't have nothing to do with drinking Bud Light either by the way. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2089.0s)]
*  That made me want to move to Montana. I want to be in the mountains and see the dust and shit. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2094.0s)]
*  That's the dumbest commercial of all time. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2100.0s)]
*  But it's so obvious what they're doing. They needed to let that sit for a little bit. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2104.0s)]
*  But that's what I'm saying. You don't have one or two guys on the board going, I don't know if this is a good decision. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2109.0s)]
*  I don't think they get to. I think that lady made a decision and she thought inclusiveness is important. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2116.0s)]
*  We're going to open up the brand to new people. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2122.0s)]
*  Or is this like an organized crime hit? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2125.0s)]
*  The thing is, if she didn't make the thing about frat boy culture, if she didn't disparage... [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2128.0s)]
*  What was her exact quote? See if you can find her exact quote. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2135.0s)]
*  If she didn't disparage the humor of the people that enjoy the product. That is such a crazy move. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2138.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. It's just like an organ in my head. I go wacky. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2146.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is if she just said, everyone can like Bud Light. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2151.0s)]
*  If that was her and she's like, America is the freedom to be whoever the fuck you want to be. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2156.0s)]
*  If that's what they said, I'd be like, okay, great. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2161.0s)]
*  She was disparaging. She was talking about inclusivity and talking about the sort of frat culture around Bud Light. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2164.0s)]
*  The CEO's name is Brendan Whitworth. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2172.0s)]
*  Is that the guy? There was a woman saying, yeah, that's a man. So this person was a woman. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2175.0s)]
*  Unless I'm misgendering them. Jesus Christ. Don't say it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2182.0s)]
*  It was a woman for sure. There's videos of her talking about it. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2187.0s)]
*  There's videos of her talking about why she made the decision to do this. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2191.0s)]
*  But it's like you can say that we want other people like America's freedom and the freedom to be whoever you want. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2197.0s)]
*  If you want to be a woman for day 368, that's your freedom too. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2205.0s)]
*  But if you're doing that and trying to like change who buys the company and dismiss all the other people by the company, by the beer from the company, that's so dumb. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2209.0s)]
*  It's like such a silly move. That's what I'm saying. It's so weird to me. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2220.0s)]
*  I instantly always see mob hits. Yeah. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2224.0s)]
*  Not I see a mob hit just walking in like your company's done. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2227.0s)]
*  What do you mean? Fucking done. What do you mean? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2232.0s)]
*  Everyone's fucking out. Put on the thing that's going to get rid of their crowd. You don't think you're fucked? You'll never kill us. Oh, really? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2236.0s)]
*  Let's roll the. Oh, you mean like someone did it to try to kill Bud Light? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2243.0s)]
*  They're fucked. What a great hit. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2247.0s)]
*  That would be amazing if Heineken snuck in and did that to them. Someone came in there. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2251.0s)]
*  Like put the transitioning. Yeah. The lady was a guy like an agent provocateur. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2256.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have an agent inside the company that tanks the company and it turns out you're shorting them on the stock market. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2263.0s)]
*  Crushed it in your pageant on the side. They open up a different company. That's really madly. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2269.0s)]
*  I love that you just move in assets. Elon Musk and Bill Gates have a little dispute because Bill Gates shorts Tesla. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2274.0s)]
*  What? He shorts it, meaning he banks on Tesla doing poorly. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2281.0s)]
*  Elon and him have like a billionaire feud because of this. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2286.0s)]
*  Bro, that's... [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2292.0s)]
*  He's petty. I love it. I'm not petty, but I like when people are. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2297.0s)]
*  I do. I enjoy it. I enjoy when people are petty. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2306.0s)]
*  What are two billionaires... What are they upping each other on? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2309.0s)]
*  I just think it's disrespectful for Bill Gates to short Tesla's position. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2314.0s)]
*  That's a gangster move. I'm not a fan of Bill Gates. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2320.0s)]
*  It's not a wise move because that company is going to kill it. Wait until that goddamn Cybertruck comes out. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2324.0s)]
*  Dude, let me tell you something. That is the coolest vehicle I've ever seen in person in my life. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2329.0s)]
*  The Cybertruck from Tesla. It's a stamped steel electric all off-road vehicle that's bulletproof. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2335.0s)]
*  It could stop a 45 round. You can raise and lower the height so you can off-road on this fucking thing. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2345.0s)]
*  It looks like it's a hundred years in the future. When you're standing next to it, it's absolutely the coolest looking car I've ever seen. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2353.0s)]
*  You see it in pictures. Have you ever seen it in pictures? If you see it in pictures, it looks fucking badass. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2361.0s)]
*  But if you see it in person, you realize how big this thing is, and then you get it in it, it's fucking gorgeous. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2366.0s)]
*  That's what it looks like. When that thing comes out, you can't make enough of these fucking things. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2373.0s)]
*  These goddamn things are going to be everywhere. Everyone's going to have a bulletproof car. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2380.0s)]
*  Bill Gates is making a terrible choice. That's what it looks like. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2384.0s)]
*  When you see it in real life, you just go, holy fucking shit. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2388.0s)]
*  What's the movie when they're... What's the famous movie? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2393.0s)]
*  Look at that fucking thing. Look at the size of the windshield wiper. That's one giant windshield wiper that goes across the whole screen. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2396.0s)]
*  It's like a tank, bro. Without the big cannons. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2402.0s)]
*  And it goes zero to 60 in three seconds. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2406.0s)]
*  And it goes out in the... Is it like a four... A hundred percent. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2409.0s)]
*  It goes over rocks and all that stuff? Yes. Oh yeah, it's flat. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2412.0s)]
*  Because there's no drivetrain. There's no transmission in the center of the car. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2414.0s)]
*  So the entire car is flat on the bottom. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2418.0s)]
*  So even if you have an off-road vehicle, you have axles. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2421.0s)]
*  And these axles, they protrude, they stick down. And so that messes with your clearance. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2424.0s)]
*  That's why the trucks are raised, and that's why the tires are bigger. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2428.0s)]
*  So you can get over... That's because you can get over more shit. What is this? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2431.0s)]
*  It's some video of it driving. Oh, video of it driving. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2435.0s)]
*  Yeah, I went to visit the Gigafactory, and they had it at the Gigafactory. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2439.0s)]
*  And they had been off-roading in it, so it was all covered in mud and shit. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2444.0s)]
*  Dude, it's fucking amazing looking. Hey, it drives itself, probably. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2447.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, it does everything. What's this guy doing? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2451.0s)]
*  I'm trying to test it, I think, yeah. They're testing. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2453.0s)]
*  Show you all the other cars and stuff. Yeah, it drives itself. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2456.0s)]
*  Mine drives itself. I kind of can't wait for it just going, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2458.0s)]
*  Hey man, bring me... Bring me over... Bring me to my kid's house today. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2461.0s)]
*  It's definitely going to be able to do that in the future. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2467.0s)]
*  I'm just sitting in the back, so I'm going to take a nap. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2469.0s)]
*  Can you wake me up when we get there? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2471.0s)]
*  We're probably about 10 years away from that, but it's going to happen. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2473.0s)]
*  It's going to be everywhere. You can summon your car. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2475.0s)]
*  Like with a Tesla that's in a parking lot, you can summon it to you. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2478.0s)]
*  It'll come to your app. Is it doing that now? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2484.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does it right now. It'll pull out of the parking spot. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2487.0s)]
*  Come on. Have you used it? No. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2491.0s)]
*  Yeah, I tried it once, it didn't work. Oh. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2493.0s)]
*  It'll come out of the... I watch people who do it on YouTube. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2495.0s)]
*  I've seen people do it, but I tried it once. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2498.0s)]
*  Honestly, I don't even use the auto drive. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2500.0s)]
*  When they gave us the new Beta, I fucked with it for a little bit, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2502.0s)]
*  but I get uneasy. I don't want to not concentrate. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2506.0s)]
*  I want my hands on the wheel, and I want to concentrate. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2511.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a guy who's also a friend, and he does all electric car stuff around the world. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2513.0s)]
*  I remember the first time he got me one of those Teslas, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2522.0s)]
*  and he kept turning around, and yes, it was steering. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2524.0s)]
*  It would go around a curve. Don't do that, buddy. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2529.0s)]
*  I was like, please. I don't think I can do that. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2531.0s)]
*  I've kept it on automatic before and just fucked around and show people, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2534.0s)]
*  look, it's driving itself. I'm not that trusting of it. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2539.0s)]
*  Me either. Also, if people would try to go in your lane, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2543.0s)]
*  and it doesn't recognize it, it panics. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2545.0s)]
*  So it'll slam. Whereas you maybe would just slow down a little, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2548.0s)]
*  and the person would slide into your lane. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2551.0s)]
*  There's subtle understanding of how fast this guy's going, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2554.0s)]
*  whether this guy doesn't see me, or whether they're being aggressive. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2558.0s)]
*  There's different things you have to do, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2561.0s)]
*  and you could avoid stuff without slamming on the fucking brakes [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2563.0s)]
*  and swerving into the oncoming lane. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2566.0s)]
*  My car does that. Once in a while, and I don't even have the automatic drive on it, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2568.0s)]
*  nothing like that, or cruise control. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2574.0s)]
*  It'll be driving all of a sudden. It'll just jolt stuff. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2576.0s)]
*  It hits the brakes? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2578.0s)]
*  Dude, yes. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2579.0s)]
*  What kind of car is it? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2580.0s)]
*  Honda Insight. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2581.0s)]
*  We've got to get you out of that thing. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2582.0s)]
*  I know. Everyone tries to. I don't know if it's a dorky thing. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2585.0s)]
*  I always drive little shithead cars. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2589.0s)]
*  Do you like them? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2593.0s)]
*  I just like fucking... I like trucks. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2596.0s)]
*  What kind of trucks? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2600.0s)]
*  Like a 150. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2602.0s)]
*  Why don't you get yourself a Raptor? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2603.0s)]
*  A Raptor? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2605.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2606.0s)]
*  Jim Brewer. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2608.0s)]
*  Tell me about the Raptor. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2609.0s)]
*  F-150 Raptor. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2610.0s)]
*  A Raptor. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2611.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know about that? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2612.0s)]
*  Tell me about it. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2613.0s)]
*  High-performance Ford F-150 off-road capable pickup truck [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2614.0s)]
*  that you could take around the street. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2620.0s)]
*  You could literally... [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2623.0s)]
*  Elon's truck? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2624.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It could do anything. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2625.0s)]
*  Oh, Raptors are super capable. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2627.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could go Baja fucking racing in one of those things. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2629.0s)]
*  You could go off-roading in them. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2632.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Raptors like from the factory you could take that bitch off-roading. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2633.0s)]
*  They have crazy capabilities. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2637.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2639.0s)]
*  Show them what it looks like. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2640.0s)]
*  It's not going to be cheap. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2642.0s)]
*  God damn it. You got that touring money. Let's go. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2643.0s)]
*  Let's go. You got to spend some of that. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2646.0s)]
*  I have all women in my house. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2648.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2650.0s)]
*  Well, two of them are gone. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2651.0s)]
*  So that's where it's getting spent? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2652.0s)]
*  Well, some is coming back. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2654.0s)]
*  God, they're out. One, the bank is shut. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2657.0s)]
*  Look at this thing. This is a Raptor. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2660.0s)]
*  Oh, my... [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2662.0s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2664.0s)]
*  See, I need that in Florida right now. I'm Florida. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2665.0s)]
*  I don't think that's good. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2667.0s)]
*  The way that hit... [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2668.0s)]
*  90 feet's a little far. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2669.0s)]
*  Yeah, the way that hit, I think he blew his fucking car apart. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2671.0s)]
*  Bro, I got a little too... [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2676.0s)]
*  You know, you said this thing, Les, that you... [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2677.0s)]
*  It's very funny in your bit, right? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2679.0s)]
*  But I found myself... [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2681.0s)]
*  I found myself like, dude, you talking about Florida, bro? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2683.0s)]
*  You're like a proud Floridian now. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2686.0s)]
*  Yeah, you say... I forgot what it was. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2688.0s)]
*  Yeah, you'll ruin the bit if I... [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2690.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm not going to, but you just... [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2692.0s)]
*  Imagine Florida, and I remember I was in the balcony, I'm like... [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2694.0s)]
*  And I'm laughing. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2697.0s)]
*  He's just fucking... [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2699.0s)]
*  Tomorrow I'm coming with a Texas thing. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2703.0s)]
*  I won't say I was going to... [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2705.0s)]
*  It was really funny, though, but like, yeah, I feel like I need a truck. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2707.0s)]
*  I... [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2710.0s)]
*  I need a truck. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2712.0s)]
*  I think I need a truck. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2714.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like the... [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2716.0s)]
*  The little bit of the... [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2718.0s)]
*  I like the hillbilly thing going on. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2720.0s)]
*  Well, if you want a truck that never breaks, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2722.0s)]
*  get yourself a Toyota. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2724.0s)]
*  Get yourself like one of those Tacomas. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2726.0s)]
*  They make great little trucks. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2729.0s)]
*  If you want a little truck, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2731.0s)]
*  if you want a bigger truck, get yourself a Tundra. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2733.0s)]
*  Those fucking things never break, man. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2735.0s)]
*  There's something about the Toyota's build quality. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2737.0s)]
*  I know so many people that have Tacomas. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2741.0s)]
*  They never have a problem with those things. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2743.0s)]
*  Never. They just drive. They just go. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2745.0s)]
*  Everyone says Toyota's the... [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2747.0s)]
*  If you want a car or vehicle that's going to last a long time, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2749.0s)]
*  do the Toyota. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2752.0s)]
*  And it took a while for my dad, because he wouldn't do it, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2754.0s)]
*  and then finally, I think his last car is a Toyota Camry. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2757.0s)]
*  So much of our cars are built overseas. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2759.0s)]
*  Yeah, who cares? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2761.0s)]
*  And it's like... [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2763.0s)]
*  The reality is, like, they build Honda NSXs in Ohio. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2765.0s)]
*  You know, there were... It wasn't in Ohio? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2768.0s)]
*  It was, yeah. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2770.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like, that's a Japanese car being made in America. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2772.0s)]
*  There's a world market when it comes to cars. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2776.0s)]
*  There's not... Like, if you wanted to have a car [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2779.0s)]
*  that's, like, a really American-made car, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2781.0s)]
*  Tesla is about as close as you get. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2783.0s)]
*  And even Tesla, of course, the batteries don't come from America. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2785.0s)]
*  Like, the minerals don't come from America. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2788.0s)]
*  There's... You know. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2791.0s)]
*  You want to get an American car, get an old car. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2793.0s)]
*  That's a real American car. Get a 1969 Camry. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2796.0s)]
*  With a stick shift? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2798.0s)]
*  One of them stick shifts or something. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2800.0s)]
*  Yeah, like a... [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2802.0s)]
*  Just driving down the Tallahassee Highway. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2804.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2807.0s)]
*  I never was a car guy, man. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2809.0s)]
*  I know. That's sad. That's sad. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2811.0s)]
*  I know. Matter of fact, it's really sad. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2813.0s)]
*  My first one was a 73 Chevy Nova. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2815.0s)]
*  That's the last year of the NSX. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2817.0s)]
*  They're canceling it, unfortunately. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2819.0s)]
*  That's your thing? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2821.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a beautiful car. I've never had one. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2823.0s)]
*  I had the old one. I had an NSX from 2005, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2825.0s)]
*  and I had one from like 96. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2827.0s)]
*  I had two different ones in the past. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2829.0s)]
*  One with the pop-up headlights and one with the fixed headlights. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2831.0s)]
*  And what do you... What do you got now? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2834.0s)]
*  Those were like little... [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2836.0s)]
*  The one that I had was this cool little silver car. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2838.0s)]
*  Like, they were all aluminum. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2840.0s)]
*  They were like basically Japan's response to a Ferrari. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2842.0s)]
*  That's what the NSX was. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2846.0s)]
*  When you were doing stand-up, what was your car? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2848.0s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2850.0s)]
*  Like when you first started, what was your car? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2852.0s)]
*  I had shit boxes. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2854.0s)]
*  I had like a Honda Accord. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2856.0s)]
*  I had like a lot of terrible cars until I got some money. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2858.0s)]
*  But that car was a fucking marvelous little car. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2860.0s)]
*  They're worth a lot of money now. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2862.0s)]
*  Because people are realizing how fun they are to drive. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2864.0s)]
*  It's like a little go-kart. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2867.0s)]
*  Mid-engine. It's not that fast, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2869.0s)]
*  but it's like really exciting to drive. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2871.0s)]
*  Very fun to drive. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2873.0s)]
*  The cars where I live, Naples, oh my God. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2875.0s)]
*  I didn't realize how poor I was until I moved to Naples. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2877.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2880.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's like all Billionaires and shit. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2882.0s)]
*  Rolls Royces. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2884.0s)]
*  There's at least three Bentleys just in my neighborhood. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2886.0s)]
*  Do you know how crazy that sounds? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2890.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2892.0s)]
*  I've seen two my whole life. There's three in the neighborhood. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2894.0s)]
*  And I'm going by Honda Insight. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2897.0s)]
*  You ever been in one of those? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2899.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2901.0s)]
*  They're fucking worth it. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2902.0s)]
*  Sometimes you get into another time zone. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2904.0s)]
*  You sit in a Rolls Royce, you go, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2906.0s)]
*  okay, I know why you spent all this money. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2908.0s)]
*  You look up, the ceiling is just like this with the stars. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2910.0s)]
*  That is wild, dude. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2912.0s)]
*  But there's something about that level of balling [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2914.0s)]
*  that's uncomfortable for me. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2917.0s)]
*  Is it? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2919.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't ball like that. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2920.0s)]
*  That's too hard. You're balling too hard. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2922.0s)]
*  So am I going too soft with the Honda Insight? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2924.0s)]
*  That's why I like muscle cars. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2927.0s)]
*  Muscle cars, you're balling, but muscle cars are like, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2929.0s)]
*  you know, those are like, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2931.0s)]
*  that's a car that pretty much anybody who saves up money [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2933.0s)]
*  can get a version of a muscle car. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2937.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2939.0s)]
*  You know, it's like you're not going to get a version [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2940.0s)]
*  of a new Ferrari convertible. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2943.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2945.0s)]
*  You're not going to get any version. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2946.0s)]
*  But if you buy a 69 Camaro and you spend a ton of money on it [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2948.0s)]
*  and have it coming out looking cherry with amazing paint [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2951.0s)]
*  and wheels, but another kid also has a 69 Camaro [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2954.0s)]
*  and he's working on it in his garage, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2957.0s)]
*  like that's an accessible car. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2959.0s)]
*  Like his shit could have Bondo on it. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2961.0s)]
*  You know, it could have fucking old wheels and tires, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2963.0s)]
*  but he's fixing things and like that's a baller car. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2966.0s)]
*  That's like an accessible car. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2969.0s)]
*  Damn. Yeah. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2971.0s)]
*  I'm never going to, I can't even, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2973.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be fucking baller. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2975.0s)]
*  I don't know if I can ever be a baller. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2977.0s)]
*  If I had a baller, you know what I really want, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2979.0s)]
*  you know what I got into? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2981.0s)]
*  Look at that one. Look at that. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2982.0s)]
*  Mustang Super Snake. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2984.0s)]
*  The Hummers. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2985.0s)]
*  Mustang Super Snakes. That's the convertible. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2986.0s)]
*  Look at that. God damn, look at that thing. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2988.0s)]
*  See, that doesn't, I don't. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2990.0s)]
*  That doesn't get you down? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2992.0s)]
*  No. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2993.0s)]
*  What? What's wrong with you? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2994.0s)]
*  Go back to that convertible. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2995.0s)]
*  That convertible excites me. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2996.0s)]
*  Does it? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2997.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had a Shelby GT 500 convertible. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=2998.0s)]
*  I don't even know what that is. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3002.0s)]
*  I fucking loved it. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3003.0s)]
*  I loved it. It was like a 2011 I think I had or 12. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3004.0s)]

*  I loved it. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3013.0s)]
*  It was so crude and so loud and so like so silly. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3014.0s)]
*  Like anytime you want it when you're making a turn, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3019.0s)]
*  you stop on the gas, the ass end kicks out. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3021.0s)]
*  I was like, this car is so ridiculous. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3023.0s)]
*  It was so fun. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3025.0s)]

*  It wasn't like the fastest 0 to 60. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3030.0s)]
*  Didn't handle the best. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3032.0s)]
*  It was just so much fun. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3034.0s)]
*  The roar of the engine. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3036.0s)]

*  It was so much fun. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3055.0s)]
*  It was like, you know, it wasn't the best built car, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3056.0s)]
*  but it wasn't that expensive either. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3059.0s)]
*  It's like they're like, there's some about it's like you're in a thrill ride. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3061.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're not driving every time you're heading on the gas. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3066.0s)]
*  Like the top is down, right? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3069.0s)]
*  So you hear everything. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3071.0s)]
*  So you hear the you stomping on the gas, the fucking the winds in your face. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3072.0s)]
*  Oh, it was so much fun. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3078.0s)]

*  The good thing about that is you see trouble ahead. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3240.0s)]
*  If you're in a little car, like a low car, the problem is like sometimes shit's happening [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3242.0s)]
*  ahead of you and you don't know why everybody's going to hit the brakes. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3246.0s)]
*  So you don't see it until like a second or two after someone who's higher up gets a view of it. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3249.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3253.0s)]

*  But what we're talking about. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3299.0s)]
*  I have no clue. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3301.0s)]
*  The trucks. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3302.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3303.0s)]
*  Or just get yourself a Raptor. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3304.0s)]
*  This is like a Raptor is a little like a little less crazy, but it's still very big. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3305.0s)]
*  And it's like super capable and it's comfortable because they have a lot of travel like on the [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3310.0s)]
*  shocks because you off-road in them. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3315.0s)]
*  It makes driving on the road very comfortable. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3317.0s)]
*  Joe, I'm at the point in life where I'm at. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3320.0s)]
*  I'm like, I can I can literally live in the middle of nowhere. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3325.0s)]
*  I think and and just disappear for a year or two. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3329.0s)]
*  I don't know, but that's where I feel like I'm at at some at times. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3336.0s)]
*  So I just need a truck. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3340.0s)]
*  I need a fast car. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3342.0s)]
*  Maybe like a truck. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3343.0s)]
*  And that's that. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3344.0s)]
*  But I'm close. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3345.0s)]
*  That's why you want a Raptor. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3346.0s)]
*  You don't never get those feelings yet. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3347.0s)]
*  What? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3349.0s)]
*  The one to go away from just like, dude, fucking out. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3350.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3353.0s)]
*  Well, you know, we're talking about before we talk about like the hunter gatherer people [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3354.0s)]
*  and people. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3358.0s)]
*  I go hunting every year. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3359.0s)]
*  And that's to me like it's a big reset. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3360.0s)]
*  When I go like in the mountains of Utah, when I'm there for a week, it's like it's a big [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3363.0s)]
*  reset. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3369.0s)]
*  And it's also man, you're in the real wild. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3370.0s)]
*  Like when we were there, I guess it was two years ago that I saw that cat. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3372.0s)]
*  Was it two years? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3375.0s)]
*  It wasn't this year. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3376.0s)]
*  It was the year before that. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3377.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3378.0s)]
*  Not a giant cat. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3379.0s)]
*  It was so big, dude. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3381.0s)]
*  It was under a tree. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3383.0s)]
*  My friend Colton spotted it for we were driving. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3384.0s)]
*  He was driving and we were taking this dirt road and we go through this creek and we're [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3386.0s)]
*  going up this little hill and he stops on the brakes real quick. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3391.0s)]
*  And he goes, look at that fucking lion. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3394.0s)]
*  And I look and I just see these glowing eyes that are underneath this tree and the headlights. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3397.0s)]
*  It was just getting dusk out. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3403.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3404.0s)]
*  And the headlights were catching his eyes and his eyes were glowing. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3405.0s)]
*  Bro, it was huge. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3408.0s)]
*  He had this big old fucking pumpkin head and these giant forearms and he's sitting there. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3411.0s)]
*  This was a full grown Tom Mountain lion. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3416.0s)]
*  It was a real big male, like a 180, 190 pound cat. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3420.0s)]
*  Like that. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3425.0s)]
*  It was that big. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3426.0s)]
*  It was so crazy. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3427.0s)]
*  I'd seen him before, but the ones I'd seen before were like little ones. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3428.0s)]
*  I saw like a 60 pounder maybe or 70 pounder running across the street in Montecito in Santa [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3431.0s)]
*  Barbara. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3436.0s)]
*  I was just driving and I saw this thing run across the street. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3437.0s)]
*  Then I saw his tail. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3439.0s)]
*  I was like, oh shit, that's a mountain lion. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3440.0s)]
*  So what do you do when you see this thing staring at you? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3442.0s)]
*  Well, we were in a truck. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3447.0s)]
*  Luckily. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3448.0s)]
*  Luckily we were in a truck. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3449.0s)]
*  But dude, I pulled up my binoculars from the truck because it was about 30 yards away from [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3450.0s)]
*  us. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3454.0s)]
*  I pulled up my binoculars in the truck and I was freaking out. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3455.0s)]
*  Just closed in on this thing, this fucking killing machine. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3458.0s)]
*  Dude, I'd never seen one that close before in the wild. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3462.0s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3466.0s)]
*  Any illusions you have of escape or fighting it off, they go, your brain does all these [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3468.0s)]
*  calculations like maybe I could fuck up. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3476.0s)]
*  No, it's just all that shit is gone. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3478.0s)]
*  All that shit is so out the window when you actually see one. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3481.0s)]
*  Like you just melt. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3484.0s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, I'm putty. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3486.0s)]
*  I'm a water balloon. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3488.0s)]
*  It's just going to scratch me apart. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3490.0s)]
*  They're so big, dude. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3493.0s)]
*  It's so scary. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3494.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3495.0s)]
*  You really have to be careful and or have a gun because there's a moment if you're in [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3496.0s)]
*  the wrong place at the wrong time where people get got every year. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3503.0s)]
*  People get got. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3507.0s)]
*  Joggers and hikers, they get got. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3509.0s)]
*  Those motherfuckers will eat you. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3512.0s)]
*  And it's not you can do. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3514.0s)]
*  They hit you, you're out, they're dragging you up the hill. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3515.0s)]
*  They'll grab a hold of your neck and you'll never get them off. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3518.0s)]
*  They'll just kill you. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3521.0s)]
*  You don't understand how much force that thing is killing. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3522.0s)]
*  That thing is killing bull moose. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3525.0s)]
*  It's jumping on the back of a moose and killing it. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3527.0s)]
*  Like you got to understand this is a super predator that lives amongst us. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3530.0s)]
*  And in California, like we have to protect them. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3535.0s)]
*  We have to protect them. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3537.0s)]
*  We have to keep them alive. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3539.0s)]
*  Until it eats your cat. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3541.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3543.0s)]
*  Or your dog. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3544.0s)]
*  Well, they eat mostly cats and dogs. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3545.0s)]
*  They did a study of them in San Francisco and all the ones that they had deprivation. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3546.0s)]
*  Is it depredation or depredation? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3551.0s)]
*  Depredation. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3553.0s)]
*  I think it's depredatorizing or something like that. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3554.0s)]
*  But when a predator is a problem, they get a depredation permit and then they have to take it out. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3557.0s)]
*  And when they take them out, they were doing studies on their stomach contents. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3562.0s)]
*  It was 50% cats and dogs. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3566.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3568.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, it makes sense. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3569.0s)]
*  Easy prey. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3570.0s)]
*  They're just sitting in the backyard. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3571.0s)]
*  They're in the front. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3572.0s)]
*  You let your dog out to pee and the next thing you know. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3573.0s)]
*  Benson? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3575.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3576.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3577.0s)]
*  Benson? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3578.0s)]
*  It happened to a buddy of mine recently with coyotes. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3579.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3581.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3582.0s)]
*  You know those videos? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3583.0s)]
*  I have, unfortunately. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3584.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3585.0s)]
*  I watch those too. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3586.0s)]
*  The scary ones are when wolves get a dog. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3587.0s)]
*  You got a chained up dog. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3589.0s)]
*  Chained up. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3590.0s)]
*  Chained up. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3591.0s)]
*  And there's nothing. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3592.0s)]
*  And you see the dog knows he's fucked. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3593.0s)]
*  The dog knows he's fucked. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3594.0s)]
*  He knows he's fucked. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3595.0s)]
*  He's chained up. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3596.0s)]
*  He can't even run away. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3597.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3598.0s)]
*  And they'll pull him right from the chain. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3599.0s)]
*  They tear him apart. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3600.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3601.0s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3602.0s)]
*  But that's your, not the horrifying, but that's your piece. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3603.0s)]
*  That's your going away. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3607.0s)]
*  I'm learning that from hunters where a lot of the hunters, I shouldn't say a lot, the [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3608.0s)]
*  ones that I know, it's not so much the hunt. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3615.32s)]
*  I mean, yes, it's the hunt, but it's also being out there in nature, in the wild, just [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3620.0s)]
*  you and nature. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3626.2s)]
*  And that just completely reboots everything about you. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3628.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's certainly a part of it. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3631.64s)]
*  That's certainly a part of it. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3633.68s)]
*  There's a lot of things going on out there. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3634.68s)]
*  It's also like there's a connection to the actual cycle of life. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3636.44s)]
*  Like you'll stumble upon a dead animal that has been torn apart by something. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3641.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3646.2400000000002s)]
*  We were in British Columbia once and we stumbled upon this cow moose, this calf rather, that [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3647.2400000000002s)]
*  had been torn apart by wolves. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3655.04s)]
*  And it's just all hair and bones. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3656.96s)]
*  It's just wild. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3659.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3660.0s)]
*  That's another reason why I like going to Africa, going to Safari, going to, I love, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3661.76s)]
*  it snaps you back into reality. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3669.68s)]
*  This is true life. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3672.96s)]
*  This is true nature. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3674.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3675.36s)]
*  We've created something really weird with cities. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3676.36s)]
*  And because we're so adaptable, because people are so adaptable, we've adapted to city life [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3678.48s)]
*  and it is so unsustainable. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3684.2s)]
*  It's such a weird way to live because you can't get your food that way. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3687.68s)]
*  The food has to be shipped in every day, constantly. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3690.36s)]
*  The real way to live is to live around your food. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3694.6400000000003s)]
*  That's the way to live. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3697.6400000000003s)]
*  The real way to live is to live like real close by to your food. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3698.84s)]
*  When everything is getting shipped in, it has to go up an elevator to get to the 50th [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3702.28s)]
*  floor where you live. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3707.08s)]
*  You got some banana like me when I was like 18 and I was shipping produce. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3709.2400000000002s)]
*  And then you got like cherry tomatoes on top and I'm stoned out of my bird. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3713.56s)]
*  And you're eating the cherry tomatoes? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3717.2400000000002s)]
*  No, I'm eating the cherry tomatoes and the guy's like, now listen, when you go down the [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3718.3999999999996s)]
*  stairs, if you feel the thing going, I'm pretty sure it was a fucking mobster restaurant. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3721.7599999999998s)]
*  I know it was. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3728.12s)]
*  And he's like, listen, this is the guy's father. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3729.24s)]
*  He's like, so he loves his cherry tomatoes? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3732.52s)]
*  No fucker prop, dude. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3734.2s)]
*  I went, I made on the truck, maybe two steps. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3735.2s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3738.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3739.8399999999997s)]
*  He's like, oh go distract them and you pick that shit up, fucking clean up. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3740.8399999999997s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3745.68s)]
*  But the point is, yeah, you couldn't pay me. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3746.68s)]
*  This is just me. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3749.68s)]
*  I mean, you were talking last night, Jim, she moved to Austin. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3751.0s)]
*  I don't think I can ever live near a city again, bro. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=3755.9199999999996s)]

*  Oh my God. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4112.48s)]
*  Bro. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4113.48s)]
*  What a. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4114.48s)]
*  What is that stuff? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4115.48s)]
*  Tannerite. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4116.48s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4117.48s)]
*  Watch this again. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4118.48s)]
*  So he shoots it, watch the door and think and just think to yourself, what do you do here? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4119.48s)]
*  Even how heavy that door is. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4124.48s)]
*  Yeah, you're not getting away from that. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4126.48s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4128.48s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4129.48s)]
*  Bro, that guy was so slow to react. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4130.48s)]
*  He would have been a dead man. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4133.48s)]
*  He might have been really stoned to say. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4135.48s)]
*  He would have been a dead man. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4136.48s)]
*  I mean, look how fast that door is coming out. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4137.48s)]
*  I think the tree would have protected him in any way. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4139.48s)]
*  Yeah, it would have. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4144.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4145.48s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4146.48s)]
*  But he probably still would have got fucked up by shrapnel. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4147.48s)]
*  Let's see how fast it, let's see. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4150.48s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4151.48s)]
*  But one, two, he had two seconds, like a second and a half to react to that. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4152.48s)]
*  How about the fact that the door bows like a sail. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4157.48s)]
*  It just takes off. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4160.48s)]
*  There's so much force behind it, it bends like a sail. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4161.48s)]
*  Did you see that? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4164.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4165.48s)]
*  Show it again. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4166.48s)]
*  It comes out. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4167.48s)]
*  Like the door is like. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4168.48s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4169.48s)]
*  Like look at the way the door bends as it passes by him. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4170.48s)]
*  This guy's such a psycho. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4176.48s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4180.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4181.48s)]
*  See how it bends? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4184.48s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4186.48s)]
*  It just completely bent out. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4187.48s)]
*  Like this. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4189.48s)]
*  It looked like the nose of a plane. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4190.48s)]
*  There's so much force, the fucking door folded over like a paper cup. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4192.48s)]
*  What a psycho. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4197.48s)]
*  See, but. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4200.48s)]
*  Actually, I'm looking at that, I think that's about 50 yards. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4201.48s)]
*  Dude, look at that thing. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4206.48s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4208.48s)]
*  That guy was so not getting out of the way. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4209.48s)]
*  He was taking that in the mug. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4212.48s)]
*  No, he wasn't. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4214.48s)]
*  So are we going to be able to do stuff like this? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4215.48s)]
*  Yes, but different. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4217.48s)]
*  A little different? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4218.48s)]
*  Yeah, we're not going to use the refrigerator doors. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4219.48s)]
*  We're going to do something wise. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4221.48s)]
*  Like what? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4223.48s)]
*  Something that blows up that's not going to hurt you. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4224.48s)]
*  From a nice distance. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4228.48s)]
*  We're going to have to develop some sort of concrete wall system. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4229.48s)]
*  That would be something kind of funny too, like big rubber. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4231.48s)]
*  You're like looking through the concrete wall of a turret and then you're blowing shit up on the other side of a lake or something. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4234.48s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds fun. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4239.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4241.48s)]
*  As long as it doesn't litter. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4242.48s)]
*  Better make sure we're not littering. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4243.48s)]
*  Yeah, you have a crew. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4244.48s)]
*  Clean that shit up. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4245.48s)]
*  See what a tank shell does to a human body. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4248.48s)]
*  Don't show me this. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4250.48s)]
*  What? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4251.48s)]
*  Don't show me this. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4252.48s)]
*  That's already destroyed. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4253.48s)]
*  What is that? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4254.48s)]
*  That's a human body. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4255.48s)]
*  152 millimeter shell versus a body. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4256.48s)]
*  I mean it's not a real body obviously. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4258.48s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4261.48s)]
*  Bro. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4264.48s)]
*  Bro. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4265.48s)]
*  You just vaporize. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4266.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4268.48s)]
*  Maybe stem cells can fix that. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4269.48s)]
*  There have been people in the world I'm sure that got hit by a tank. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4273.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4277.48s)]
*  I'm not just like, they're not like only shooting buildings with those things. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4278.48s)]
*  I guarantee it. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4282.48s)]
*  I saw a video in Ukraine recently where they just blew it right into a foxhole. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4283.48s)]
*  There's three dudes right there. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4286.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4287.48s)]
*  And it seemed like everything vaporized. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4288.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4289.48s)]
*  But I don't know if they hit them or not. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4290.48s)]
*  See what plus, which I don't understand, listen, I don't get involved with all the Ukraine stuff, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4292.48s)]
*  but what I understand is at this day and age still, are they really doing ground army? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4300.48s)]
*  When you have the technology just to tap a computer and just send, like are we really on the ground [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4307.48s)]
*  and moving with tanks and stuff? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4316.48s)]
*  That blows my mind. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4317.48s)]
*  Well, they're trying to overtake a very specific piece of land, you know, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4318.48s)]
*  and that's the way they're doing it. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4323.48s)]
*  They're using tanks. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4325.48s)]
*  The whole thing is very spooky. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4326.48s)]
*  It's so spooky that that's happening right now on Earth. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4328.48s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4332.48s)]
*  And Russia is invading Ukraine and they're using tanks and drones. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4333.48s)]
*  What is that, Jamie? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4337.48s)]
*  Drone dropped a grenade inside of a tank hole. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4339.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4342.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4344.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4346.48s)]
*  So did you see that? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4348.48s)]
*  Like the tank hole, the port was open on the top. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4349.48s)]
*  And it just dropped it right in there. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4352.48s)]
*  That is so insane. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4354.48s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4355.48s)]
*  Dude. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4357.48s)]
*  The drone videos are crazy. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4359.48s)]
*  There's a lot of crazy videos to be honest with. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4361.48s)]
*  Well, what's really crazy is like the Bill Hicks joke. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4363.48s)]
*  Remember Bill Hicks joke? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4366.48s)]
*  Like he said, he was doing about, you know, the different shit the Army had to work with [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4368.48s)]
*  because they had all these toys and like pull up G-12. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4375.48s)]
*  Like pull up G-12 and it's just, whoa, what's G-13 do? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4378.48s)]
*  Remember that bit? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4384.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4385.48s)]
*  And then, Lily, how I see it is just like, hey, you know, these guys said something about your sister. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4386.48s)]
*  Russian soldier reaches for his rifle to shoot down the drone. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4390.48s)]
*  Shouldn't have done that. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4393.48s)]
*  I'll skip ahead. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4396.48s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4397.48s)]
*  So it just gets over him and nukes him? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4399.48s)]
*  It drops four grenades on him. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4400.48s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4402.48s)]
*  One. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4403.48s)]
*  He's over there on the left. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4405.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4408.48s)]

*  Oh my God. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4415.48s)]

*  All right. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4420.48s)]
*  I don't need to see this. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4421.48s)]
*  But those videos are wild. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4422.48s)]
*  See, this is what's crazy to me. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4423.48s)]
*  That this is, it's, we know this is happening, but this is the first time we've ever seen [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4425.48s)]
*  like social media footage from people's cell phones of war. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4431.48s)]
*  You know, I watched a Russian guy go into a foxhole that had these two Ukrainian guys in it. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4436.48s)]
*  And the Ukrainian guy like reached for his gun and the guy shot both of them in the head. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4444.48s)]
*  And it's like close range cell phone footage. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4449.48s)]
*  It's like. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4452.48s)]
*  Well, what, what supposedly started it? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4453.48s)]
*  What started the war? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4458.48s)]
*  Russia's invading Ukraine. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4459.48s)]
*  Now some people say that, but there's others that say that because they're UN and they've [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4462.48s)]
*  been the most corrupt country in the world. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4469.48s)]
*  That's the video. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4472.48s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4473.48s)]
*  That's the video. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4474.48s)]
*  Don't show me that again. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4475.48s)]
*  And then the, um, the US with the biological weapons and Russia kept saying, Hey man, you're [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4476.48s)]
*  getting closer and closer with your shit. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4483.48s)]
*  We keep telling you, please don't do this. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4485.24s)]
*  I don't know what's a fact and what's not, but there is that side of people saying that. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4487.48s)]
*  Well, both, both are true. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4493.48s)]
*  So both things are true. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4495.48s)]
*  So one thing that's true is that what they have been doing is moving arms closer. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4497.48s)]
*  NATO has been moving arms closer to Russia. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4505.4s)]
*  So it's like me coming you and I say, Joe, I'm going to end you go Brewer. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4509.48s)]
*  Don't fucking come another step. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4514.4s)]
*  Whereas where NATO move arms closer to Russia, where there was, it was a real issue. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4515.679999999999s)]
*  So there's been a lot of, uh, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4522.759999999999s)]
*  But what about the biological weapons that lot? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4525.48s)]
*  What I was going to say is there's been a lot of discussion about doing this from the [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4528.48s)]
*  beginning. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4531.879999999999s)]
*  There was a guy who was on the Colbert show in like, um, it was the early teens, early [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4532.879999999999s)]
*  2000 teens. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4539.28s)]
*  And he had a book and he was describing in this book how Ukraine is essentially Robin [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4540.48s)]
*  and Russia is Batman and about, we want to lure, we want to lure Robin away from Batman [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4546.28s)]
*  and we want to get Robin to join NATO and we want to get Robin to like join our side. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4553.08s)]
*  And this guy's explaining this on television in a book, this plan that they had. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4559.8s)]
*  So in trying to like get further and further control close to Ukraine, Russia felt like [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4565.36s)]
*  that was an attack on them. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4574.08s)]
*  That was provoking them. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4575.4s)]
*  They felt like it would be how we would feel if China started putting nuclear missiles [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4576.92s)]
*  in Cuba. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4581.48s)]
*  A new Cuban missile crisis. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4582.879999999999s)]
*  Or in Canada. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4583.879999999999s)]
*  Or in Canada. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4584.879999999999s)]
*  Very similar. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4585.879999999999s)]
*  How would we react? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4586.879999999999s)]
*  How would we react? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4587.879999999999s)]
*  So both those things are true. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4588.879999999999s)]
*  And then Russia really did invade Ukraine and this is horrific and they're shooting missiles [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4590.879999999999s)]
*  into apartment buildings and all that stuff's true too. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4595.879999999999s)]
*  So there's both sides that are true. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4598.879999999999s)]
*  It's like, it seems like there were some, there were some strategic things that were [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4600.879999999999s)]
*  being done that Russia felt was very threatening. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4606.879999999999s)]
*  Do we know what they did? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4609.879999999999s)]
*  What NATO did in terms of like moving arms closer to Russia? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4611.28s)]
*  What about the bio weapons that supposedly America had there and they tried to say like [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4615.28s)]
*  no and then when it was brought up they openly admitted yes, we did have, we have biological [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4621.4800000000005s)]
*  weapons in Ukraine. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4627.88s)]
*  Do they call it biological weapons? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4629.4400000000005s)]
*  Or do they call it, what do they call it? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4631.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4633.28s)]
*  It was like biological, whatever. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4634.28s)]
*  Right, some bio lab. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4637.28s)]
*  Some bio lab, whatever. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4638.96s)]
*  That's what everybody wonders like when you talk about bio labs. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4640.679999999999s)]
*  Like how much of that is like, how much of this is like military applications? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4644.679999999999s)]
*  Like how much of these, this stuff do, is it 0%? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4649.679999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's 0%. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4654.679999999999s)]
*  I'm sure they must work on some things because I know that other countries work on things. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4655.679999999999s)]
*  I interviewed a guy back in the day who worked for the Soviet Union and he had defected and [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4659.679999999999s)]
*  it was for this sci-fi show and he was explaining to me how they have like giant supplies of [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4667.08s)]
*  anthrax and they have, like their biological weapons program was very robust. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4672.88s)]
*  Like they have a real biological weapons program filled with shit that could kill everybody. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4678.88s)]
*  My issue is... [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4684.08s)]
*  There was something about that according to what I researched. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4685.08s)]
*  Oh, the New York Times says it's unfounded. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4688.68s)]
*  Let's just move away. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4690.88s)]
*  Let's just move on to the next subject. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4691.88s)]
*  But that's what I'm saying. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4694.16s)]
*  If they lie to you, you caught them lying, why do we believe anything we're seeing? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4695.72s)]
*  Yeah, but do we know though? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4700.76s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4702.5199999999995s)]
*  But the problem is we don't know either. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4703.599999999999s)]
*  It's like weapons of mass destruction, right, in Iraq. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4705.16s)]
*  In the beginning everybody thought that that was what was really going on and that we were [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4707.96s)]
*  going in there to stop this from happening because we realized like this guy is funding [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4711.08s)]
*  terrorism and he's got weapons of mass destruction, he's going to kill us all. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4714.639999999999s)]
*  But it turns out to not be true at all. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4717.84s)]
*  Yeah, but the people that pushed that narrative knew it wasn't true. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4720.52s)]
*  And they funded it very well and a lot of people got murdered, like innocent people [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4724.04s)]
*  that still come back with no legs. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4729.2s)]
*  They don't get funded and they're watching Trans Guy of the Year and they're special [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4731.4800000000005s)]
*  and their legs got blown off for a cause and they're sitting there in a fucking van that [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4735.9800000000005s)]
*  drives them around, electrical. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4740.64s)]
*  That's pretty fucked up. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4743.2s)]
*  It's pretty fucked up. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4745.2s)]
*  And I know... [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4746.2s)]
*  No one's held accountable for that. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4747.2s)]
*  No one's held accountable. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4748.64s)]
*  So why am I going to believe everything they're telling me about Russia and Ukraine? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4749.64s)]
*  And why even... [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4753.240000000001s)]
*  This is what drives me nuts about humanity is better. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4755.84s)]
*  You're a fucking leader. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4759.64s)]
*  There's so many leaders that are just regular people now. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4762.64s)]
*  Why do you need government or your officials telling you where you're going to fight? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4765.46s)]
*  If someone came in here right now and they said, Joe, you need to come across the street [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4772.4400000000005s)]
*  and fight, you're just going to go fight? [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4775.52s)]
*  No, you're going to go, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4776.96s)]
*  What the fuck am I doing? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4778.4s)]
*  Don't worry about what we're doing. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4780.48s)]
*  We're going to tell you what we do. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4781.48s)]
*  Haven't they failed enough with lying and getting us into these positions? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4782.759999999999s)]
*  If regular people talk to one... [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4790.28s)]
*  I guarantee if you did a fucking podcast with real humans in Russia, real humans in [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4791.679999999999s)]
*  Ukraine, real humans everywhere, the people in control get scared real fucking quick because [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4797.759999999999s)]
*  We all have a deeper connection. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4805.72s)]
*  We want to be one another. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4807.18s)]
*  Yeah, we're not in dispute. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4808.64s)]
*  The leaders are in dispute and they drag the people into it and they're playing some geo [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4810.320000000001s)]
*  chess game. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4814.88s)]
*  What they've always done. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4816.04s)]
*  Why are our lives at stake? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4817.04s)]
*  What is the NATO thing? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4818.04s)]
*  We need to discuss that. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4819.04s)]
*  What did they do? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4821.280000000001s)]
*  What are they being accused of doing? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4822.280000000001s)]
*  I don't want to make a false statement. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4824.08s)]
*  But either way... [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4826.52s)]
*  NATO inches closer to Russia's border. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4827.52s)]
*  Okay, so what have they done here? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4829.92s)]
*  I just want to know that we're being accurate because this is not my field of expertise. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4831.08s)]
*  And I have no clue. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4834.92s)]
*  I just don't want to close all avenues that I've heard. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4835.92s)]
*  But I do believe that there was NATO... [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4838.88s)]
*  Okay, here is Putin's goal, preventing NATO expansion, essentially backfired when Finland [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4841.04s)]
*  and Sweden were motivated by the invasion of Ukraine to apply to join the military block. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4845.14s)]
*  Currently five NATO members... [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4851.16s)]
*  Okay, so NATO already border Russia or the Russian border, Norway, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4852.64s)]
*  and Poland already border Russia or the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4858.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Finland shares an 830 mile border with Russia. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4863.76s)]
*  So Russia's border with NATO would more than double if Finland attains membership of the [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4867.72s)]
*  alliance. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4872.84s)]
*  So Finland was joining NATO as well. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4873.84s)]
*  So more and more of these people were joining NATO and they were... [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4876.04s)]
*  What were they doing in terms of having arms? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4880.72s)]
*  Russia implements border control of traffic moving from Russia into Finland, thus preventing [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4885.32s)]
*  attempts at illegal entry. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4889.32s)]
*  If Russia reduces its border control, this may cause additional pressure at the Finnish [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4890.759999999999s)]
*  end to control illegal entry. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4895.08s)]
*  So they're trying to stop people from escaping. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4897.66s)]
*  Finland cannot rely on the effectiveness of Russian border control. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4900.44s)]
*  So people are just like, streaming into Finland, I bet. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4904.04s)]
*  And Poland, right? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4907.599999999999s)]
*  Well, then yeah, when this happened then too, like a lot of people left Ukraine and they [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4908.599999999999s)]
*  banned all men from leaving because they didn't stay and fight. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4912.32s)]
*  Were they saying that NATO had arms that they were moving closer to the Russian border as [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4915.82s)]
*  well when someone joins NATO? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4920.5s)]
*  Or is it just that since that army is now in NATO? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4922.82s)]
*  What was the dispute in terms of that? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4926.259999999999s)]
*  It seems like if I was Putin and everyone's joining the opposition right next to me, I [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4932.94s)]
*  would also get concerned. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4938.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4939.0199999999995s)]
*  I'd start bugging out. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4940.0199999999995s)]
*  It doesn't justify what the guy did. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4942.0199999999995s)]
*  What he did is absolutely horrific. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4944.58s)]
*  But you find a well-written essay from both sides to get... [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4946.26s)]
*  They're all creepers. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4949.14s)]
*  The whole thing's creepy. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4950.14s)]
*  But... [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4952.18s)]
*  It's great to join NATO. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4953.18s)]
*  It's great if we're all aligned. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4954.34s)]
*  It's great if we just want world peace, if that's our goal. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4955.74s)]
*  But that's... [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4959.06s)]
*  Is that really what's going on? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4960.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4961.22s)]
*  I'm waiting for the time that all changes. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4962.22s)]
*  I know. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4963.22s)]
*  We're all getting dragged into this. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4964.22s)]
*  And I'm not like anti-government, but I'm like anti-lying. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4965.22s)]
*  And they've lied long enough. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4969.58s)]
*  And it's cost people lives. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4971.66s)]
*  Do you want your... [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4973.7s)]
*  There's no reason why humanity, we have the microphones, to be able to start talking to [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4976.62s)]
*  one another, the leaders could sit there and listen. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4985.26s)]
*  But if their interest is our, as far as the humans that are occupying that, that they [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4989.22s)]
*  say they're there to take care of, they need to hear what we want. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=4995.42s)]
*  What we don't want is world leaders putting everyone's... [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5000.58s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5003.7s)]
*  ...lives in danger, which they've always done and they're doing right now. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5004.7s)]
*  This might describe Russia as... [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5007.94s)]
*  So why are they still... [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5009.38s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5011.099999999999s)]
*  Is that the spook of January 6th? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5012.3s)]
*  They're going to catch on to... [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5014.18s)]
*  Everyone needs to be held responsible who's pushing for complete madness. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5017.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5022.0199999999995s)]
*  So this is what Russia's fear... [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5023.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5025.0199999999995s)]
*  According to Steven Kotkin... [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5026.0199999999995s)]
*  Kotkin. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5028.0199999999995s)]
*  Kotkin, excuse me. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5029.0199999999995s)]
*  Kotkin! [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5030.0199999999995s)]
*  Kotkin. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5031.0199999999995s)]
*  Professor of Russian history at Princeton University, Putin believes that Russia rightfully [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5032.26s)]
*  deserves a sphere of influence in its near abroad. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5036.18s)]
*  To Putin, Ukraine is not a state because it's not sovereign. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5040.660000000001s)]
*  Small or weak states are only instruments in the hands of the great powers. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5044.3s)]
*  Where we see Moscow's aggression, Putin sees defense. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5049.580000000001s)]
*  If Russia cannot control Ukraine, then the West will. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5053.42s)]
*  Thus, countries like Ukraine become platforms for invasion and then the West will dismember [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5056.74s)]
*  Russia as the USSR was dismembered. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5062.86s)]
*  The way of thinking, Russia goes back to the Tsars. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5066.0599999999995s)]
*  Russia has no natural borders on its periphery and Stalin believed that without hegemony [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5068.82s)]
*  in Eastern Europe, he would be subject to infiltration and subversion. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5073.9s)]
*  But the peoples of Eastern Europe did not want to be forced to live under communism [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5078.62s)]
*  and thus arose the very hostile, hostility rather, Stalin feared. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5082.14s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5087.14s)]
*  So it was all about controlling the borders in the beginning and that's what they were [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5088.14s)]
*  worried about. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5092.42s)]
*  That's...okay. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5093.42s)]
*  They're all creepers. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5094.42s)]
*  They're all like making moves on each other. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5095.42s)]
*  They're all stealing oil, blowing up pipelines. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5097.54s)]

*  Everywhere. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5105.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5106.1s)]
*  The Chinese are doing it the most clever because they go to places just take over like mining. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5107.1s)]
*  Dude, they're all over Africa. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5110.7s)]

*  Chinese. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5116.06s)]
*  They're buying everything. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5117.06s)]
*  How's the food though? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5118.06s)]
*  You got good Chinese food in Africa? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5119.06s)]
*  I haven't had the Chinese food in Africa. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5120.06s)]
*  I wonder. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5122.18s)]
*  Imagine if like there's like a thriving...looks like LA with Mexican food. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5123.18s)]
*  It's the best fucking Mexican food I've ever had other than being in Mexico. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5126.42s)]
*  That's two arrested for operating illegal overseas police station. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5131.78s)]
*  Yeah, I did see that. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5135.7s)]
*  Yeah, is this in New York? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5136.94s)]

*  I don't know what the citizenship is, but I think that what they're doing is operating [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5157.299999999999s)]

*  What if they have a jail? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5238.3s)]
*  What if they have the creepiest jail ever in New York City? [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5239.3s)]
*  Oh my God, they must have a jail. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5242.3s)]
*  Of course they do. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5244.1s)]
*  Do they have a jail? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5245.1s)]
*  You probably got to go on the subway and then down the subway rail and then open a door. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5246.1s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5249.74s)]
*  It's like where the rats live. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5250.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's pitch black. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5252.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you hear things moving in the water? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5253.5s)]
*  Like you hear little drips and then you hear like... [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5255.9s)]
*  Did you hear about that prisoner in Georgia that got eaten alive by bed bugs? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5258.34s)]
*  No. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5264.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5265.3s)]
*  What? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5266.3s)]
*  This dude wound up... [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5267.3s)]
*  He was in such an infested cell that... [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5268.3s)]
*  And this is in America. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5272.82s)]
*  This is a prison. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5273.82s)]
*  This is in America. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5275.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, America. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5276.0599999999995s)]
*  This guy gets eaten alive by bed bugs. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5278.179999999999s)]
*  How is that possible? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5282.02s)]
*  I don't understand what they... [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5283.02s)]
*  He was just covered in sores. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5284.02s)]
*  They just attacked his whole body. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5285.02s)]
*  He's lying there. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5288.02s)]
*  So it's a period of time. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5289.02s)]
*  So in my head I think it happened overnight. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5290.02s)]
*  Yeah, he's like... [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5291.02s)]
*  I think he's... [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5292.02s)]
*  I don't know how... [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5293.02s)]
*  I think he's in solitary and I think they keep them in inhumane conditions. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5294.02s)]
*  And this guy was just covered in sores. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5300.5s)]
*  Did you find that other story? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5304.38s)]
*  Georgia inmate. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5305.38s)]
*  Eaten alive by bugs in filthy cell. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5306.38s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5313.179999999999s)]
*  Simple battery. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5314.179999999999s)]
*  Simple battery. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5315.179999999999s)]

*  Three months later he was found dead. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5317.179999999999s)]
*  Three months... [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5320.179999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5321.179999999999s)]

*  I don't know what happened. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5323.179999999999s)]
*  He punched the wrong dude, man. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5324.179999999999s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5325.179999999999s)]
*  So we don't know what happened there, right? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5326.179999999999s)]
*  Maybe it was... [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5327.179999999999s)]
*  Could have been anything. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5328.179999999999s)]
*  Maybe it was the other person's fault, right? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5329.179999999999s)]
*  Could be anything. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5330.179999999999s)]
*  So three months later Mr. Thompson was found dead in a filthy jail cell after being eaten [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5331.179999999999s)]
*  alive by insects and bed bugs, Harper said. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5335.74s)]
*  When his body was found, one of the detention officers refused to administer CPR because [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5339.66s)]
*  in her words, she freaked out. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5344.3s)]
*  The jail cell Mr. Thompson was housed in was not fit for a diseased animal. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5346.639999999999s)]
*  He did not deserve this. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5352.26s)]
*  Disturbing photographs attached to Harper's statement show Thompson's cell which is covered [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5353.94s)]
*  in dirt and strewn with debris. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5358.46s)]
*  One image also shows Thompson's bony body with defibrillator pads on his chest which [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5360.66s)]
*  is covered in what appear to be small insect bites. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5366.94s)]
*  Can you see the images? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5369.74s)]
*  So there's his cell. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5372.86s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5373.86s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5374.86s)]

*  Look at that fucking toilet too. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5379.5s)]
*  Oh damn. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5381.419999999999s)]
*  This is so bad. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5383.5s)]
*  Look at his body. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5386.339999999999s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5387.339999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5388.339999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5389.339999999999s)]
*  That's like an everything bagel looking thing. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5390.339999999999s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5395.379999999999s)]
*  I'm getting eaten alive by bugs. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5396.38s)]

*  That's gnarly. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5404.14s)]
*  That's in America. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5405.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5406.14s)]
*  That's in America for simple battery. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5407.14s)]
*  Everyone thinks everything's perfect and amazing. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5411.14s)]
*  Now yes, it can be. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5413.14s)]
*  Like who is monitoring the jail cells? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5415.42s)]
*  I mean they go to fucking restaurants and make sure that the conditions are, they give [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5418.22s)]
*  them an A. Do they do that with jails? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5422.18s)]
*  Who's monitoring? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5424.5s)]
*  That's an F. That guy died from beg bugs. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5425.62s)]
*  You get an F. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5428.18s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5429.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5430.18s)]
*  What do they do? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5431.18s)]
*  Whoops. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5432.18s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5433.18s)]
*  That's what Epstein was complaining about before you died. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5434.18s)]
*  Bed bugs? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5437.18s)]
*  Rats crawling all over his cell instead of his in horrid conditions. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5438.18s)]
*  I think they were flooded. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5441.9s)]
*  But he ought to know the end was near. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5443.94s)]
*  That guy? [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5446.22s)]
*  Epstein. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5447.22s)]
*  Oh Epstein. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5448.22s)]
*  I don't know what the deal is there. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5449.22s)]
*  Thank God they don't release that client list. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5451.74s)]
*  What's up with that? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5454.38s)]
*  I mean why would you release it? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5456.26s)]
*  I'm glad the wiser heads prevailed. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5457.26s)]
*  Why do you think? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5459.7s)]
*  You saw the list right? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5464.02s)]
*  I don't know if it was the list. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5465.22s)]
*  Correct. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5467.18s)]
*  You saw the supposed list. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5468.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5469.58s)]
*  I mean someone must know. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5470.58s)]
*  It bugged me out. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5473.54s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5474.58s)]
*  It bugged me out. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5475.58s)]
*  It broke my heart. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5476.58s)]
*  It seems like it was for sure some sort of intelligence operation that compromised people. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5478.400000000001s)]
*  It seems like it for sure. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5485.740000000001s)]
*  It seems like celebrities, people think that celebrities were over there to do horrible [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5487.02s)]
*  stuff. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5491.660000000001s)]
*  Maybe they were. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5493.1s)]
*  Or also maybe they got kind of swindled into doing this thing because all these other celebrities [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5494.580000000001s)]
*  were doing it and all these scientists were doing it. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5500.42s)]
*  One of the things that it seems to me that if you can get a bunch of people that are [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5502.700000000001s)]
*  really famous to go to a place and say hey, have you ever been invited to something and [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5506.46s)]
*  they'll tell you oh such and such is coming as well? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5512.38s)]
*  They'll tell you that a famous person is coming so that it makes you want to go. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5515.9s)]
*  Oh, the conference is that guy? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5519.259999999999s)]
*  So I guarantee you that's why they had celebrities there too. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5522.98s)]
*  They had celebrities because if you can get Brad Pitt to go there then all of a sudden [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5526.459999999999s)]
*  it's okay to go there. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5532.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5533.94s)]
*  You think it's fine? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5534.94s)]
*  The only things they say, they have video footage. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5537.94s)]
*  So if that's the deal, I just know if I was on there I'd be like yo. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5542.94s)]
*  Who do they have video footage of people having sex with underage people? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5549.14s)]
*  Do they have video of people, what do they have video of? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5556.26s)]
*  What do they have video of? [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5558.86s)]
*  Are they still making deals, plea deals? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5560.86s)]
*  Is that even going on? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5564.42s)]
*  That on the island talked about it? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5566.38s)]
*  Any girls who were forced, they would have to be terrified of their lives. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5570.02s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5575.26s)]
*  Imagine you were, let's just imagine that there were just adult prostitutes and you're [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5576.26s)]
*  taking care of lizard people on an island in the middle of the Bahamas. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5584.78s)]
*  You gotta shut the fuck up, they will kill you. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5589.34s)]
*  They'll probably kill one in front of everybody just to show them. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5591.54s)]
*  If you open your fucking mouth they'll just hack some ladies head off. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5595.9400000000005s)]
*  Chop her arms off. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5598.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm all invested in it. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5600.26s)]
*  People think, why doesn't anyone say anything? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5602.14s)]
*  When you know they can find you anywhere at least they'll tell you that. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5605.66s)]
*  And like you said, they can stand right in front of you, hey man you're gonna have a [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5610.740000000001s)]

*  you say anything, oh my god. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5617.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5620.700000000001s)]
*  Just kill somebody in front of you. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5621.700000000001s)]
*  Boom. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5623.700000000001s)]

*  I pray to god that's not went down. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5630.42s)]
*  But it's weird. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5633.0599999999995s)]
*  It's very weird. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5634.5s)]
*  It's very strange. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5635.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5636.5s)]
*  If you saw your name on there, right? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5637.5s)]
*  If you saw your name on there. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5642.0199999999995s)]
*  Wouldn't you be barking, well I guess there's two ways, there's two ways to look at it. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5645.139999999999s)]
*  If I just ignore it, hopefully it'll go away because you can't tell me every name that [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5649.26s)]
*  was on there. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5655.62s)]
*  Somebody let them know. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5657.5s)]
*  There's someone in their circle. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5658.5s)]
*  Someone had to know something was going on. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5659.5s)]
*  But do you think that they knew what the whole thing was? [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5662.74s)]
*  Because I think there was a lot of scientists that genuinely thought that this was a way [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5668.08s)]
*  to get this guy to donate money. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5672.14s)]
*  And you know, he would donate a little money here and there and for these projects. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5675.26s)]
*  And also these famous rich scientists would go have this lovely vacation. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5678.82s)]
*  So then if you get like actors and then you got scientists and then you get a few politicians [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5684.5199999999995s)]
*  in there, it seems like just a cool kids club. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5691.5s)]
*  We've been there. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5694.74s)]
*  It seems fine. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5695.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5696.74s)]
*  Been there, done that. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5697.74s)]
*  To a degree. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5698.74s)]
*  And the fact that that's how they made this whole thing take place is really fascinating. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5699.74s)]
*  Because it's so brilliant. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5705.98s)]
*  It really is like some spy shit. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5707.299999999999s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5709.299999999999s)]
*  It's like they they compromised people. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5710.299999999999s)]
*  It's been going on forever. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5713.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5714.66s)]
*  Forever, dude. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5715.66s)]
*  It's got to be going on right now still. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5716.66s)]
*  100%. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5718.66s)]
*  But it's got to be happening somewhere where you can get away with it. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5719.66s)]
*  Well, I mean, even in the in the Disney film and Pinocchio, it's unbelievable. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5723.099999999999s)]
*  The pub scene. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5728.459999999999s)]

*  I think there's a new Pinocchio. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5735.9s)]
*  Yeah, it became in the public domain so anybody could make a Pinocchio movie now. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=5737.82s)]

*  That power will bring the pure demonic devil out of you if that's who your God is. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6027.0199999999995s)]

*  We steal stupid little boys. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6038.96s)]
*  We bring them to Pleasure Island. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6045.2s)]
*  And then you see the fucker, he goes, Pleasure Island? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6048.64s)]
*  And he goes, no, no, no, they don't come back as little boys. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6051.4800000000005s)]
*  So you got to think, in 1940, when they're writing this, the guys that are writing this, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6057.4s)]
*  they must have probably heard stories about children getting sex trafficked. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6063.48s)]
*  They must have heard those stories because we've heard those stories. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6070.719999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6073.4s)]
*  We've heard those stories as adults. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6074.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6075.4s)]
*  There was always stories about some weird government in Italy, where the original story [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6076.4s)]
*  was written, the donkey is a symbol of stupidity. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6082.12s)]
*  The moral behind Pleasure Island is that little boys who scoff at education and moral codes [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6084.98s)]
*  set forth by their parents, preachers and authority figures will engage in jackass behavior [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6091.56s)]
*  instead such as fighting, vandalism, underage drinking, and often destined to grow up to [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6096.400000000001s)]
*  become men who have no option to make a living except through back breaking manual labor. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6100.240000000001s)]
*  And there are plenty of people in the world such as the coachmen who will take advantage [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6105.88s)]
*  of that. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6110.52s)]
*  I think maybe there's a little more going on there. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6111.6s)]
*  That's such a shallow interpretation of them kidnapping boys and saying they don't come [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6116.52s)]
*  back as boys. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6123.3s)]
*  We're just trying to help their education. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6124.3s)]
*  And then he's evil. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6126.84s)]
*  So what value would he have for the, what's the value of those boys if you're not sexualizing [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6127.84s)]
*  them? [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6133.76s)]
*  It seems like that's a very specific possibility that's happening. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6134.76s)]
*  Just very incredible that no one talks about that. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6139.240000000001s)]
*  Have you ever seen any of those documentaries about like government officials who get busted? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6142.6s)]
*  It's wild, man. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6148.64s)]
*  There must be like a certain group, like a secret group of people that have been engaging [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6150.400000000001s)]
*  in stuff like that for a long time. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6158.68s)]
*  Well think about this. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6161.120000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6162.120000000001s)]
*  Do you remember let's say, I'm going to say maybe early 90s. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6163.120000000001s)]
*  I could be wrong. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6168.080000000001s)]
*  Somewhere around that. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6169.080000000001s)]
*  Do you remember there was a girl that was kidnapped and they found her and they were [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6170.6s)]
*  hiding her as like a religious thing. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6175.28s)]
*  They had her in the woods and she came out. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6182.36s)]
*  They did a magazine article on her. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6184.04s)]
*  They did a... [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6186.6s)]
*  Jessica McClure. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6188.6s)]
*  Baby Jessica? [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6189.6s)]
*  I don't, she wasn't. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6190.6s)]
*  She was a teenager. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6191.6s)]
*  Oh that's the well girl. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6192.6s)]
*  She was a teenager. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6193.6s)]

*  Horrible things. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6199.0s)]
*  Kidnapped her and blah, blah, blah. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6200.0s)]

*  All that jazz. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6203.120000000001s)]

*  for viciously raping a child. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6212.64s)]

*  raped. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6292.200000000001s)]
*  They found all this DNA inside her from a bunch of different individuals. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6294.84s)]
*  Eight! [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6300.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6301.120000000001s)]
*  But we're going to... [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6302.28s)]
*  And nobody... [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6303.48s)]
*  And that's... [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6304.48s)]
*  There's such a... [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6305.48s)]
*  The fucking border thing is wild. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6307.96s)]
*  It's very wild. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6310.36s)]
*  It's dark. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6311.36s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6312.36s)]
*  And they set it up with Trump. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6313.36s)]
*  They were like, he's got him in cages and whatever happened, whatever. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6314.36s)]
*  It made you just like, we need to go help the border. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6319.2s)]
*  And it was almost the setup for what's going on now. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6322.24s)]
*  Just shut your face. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6325.72s)]
*  The crazy thing was when Trump said that actually Obama built those cages. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6327.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6331.44s)]
*  And he did. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6332.44s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6333.44s)]
*  A precious eight-year-old little girl was found at our border with 67 different traces [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6334.44s)]
*  of DNA inside her. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6338.5599999999995s)]
*  In Joe Biden's America, little girls get raped by 67 different men. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6341.28s)]
*  Did you pay your taxes today? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6345.16s)]
*  Perhaps some of that money could be sent to fix our border instead of whatever the rest [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6346.679999999999s)]
*  of her tweet. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6350.2s)]
*  Ukraine. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6351.2s)]
*  I doubt she wrote that. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6352.2s)]
*  We don't know if that's a true story. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6353.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6355.5599999999995s)]
*  All I'm doing is just reading her tweet, which is... [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6356.5599999999995s)]
*  If it was six different people, that's fucking insane. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6360.24s)]
*  But you can't be naive to think something like that is going on. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6363.4s)]
*  Dude, this is all insane. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6367.639999999999s)]
*  It's all insane that there's people that live in such horrific conditions, they'll risk [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6369.32s)]
*  their life to try to come to America. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6373.28s)]
*  That's where everyone's tugging on your heartstrings. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6377.32s)]
*  Because I get it. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6380.599999999999s)]
*  I get that part of it. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6381.679999999999s)]
*  But if you're just going to let people pile into the country, then people are going to [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6383.2s)]
*  keep coming. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6388.32s)]
*  They're going to know that they could pile into the country and they're going to make [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6389.4s)]
*  it through there and along with them are going to be some despicable criminals. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6392.32s)]
*  So it's not just people that want a better life. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6397.28s)]
*  It's definitely people that want a better life. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6401.04s)]
*  Also definitely despicable criminals. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6403.0s)]
*  And those make it into America with no way to stop it. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6406.32s)]
*  And unless they get caught and sent back and there's no real consequence to that, what [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6411.08s)]
*  happens? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6415.5199999999995s)]
*  You'd sent back? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6416.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay, I'll try again. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6417.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you think the natives are laughing? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6419.4800000000005s)]
*  Native Americans? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6422.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6423.240000000001s)]
*  And what I mean by that, you think they're like, I'm sorry, what's going on with you [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6424.240000000001s)]
*  guys? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6427.64s)]
*  Getting invaded? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6428.64s)]
*  Getting invaded? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6429.64s)]
*  How weird. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6430.64s)]
*  That's a bummer. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6431.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6432.64s)]
*  Huh. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6433.64s)]
*  Are they carrying smallpox? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6434.64s)]
*  No, but I don't want to hear about it. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6435.64s)]
*  You got off light. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6436.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6437.64s)]
*  A lot. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6438.64s)]
*  They're like working and stuff. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6439.64s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6441.080000000001s)]
*  Did we ever figure, they think that smallpox, we brought smallpox to the Native Americans, [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6442.68s)]
*  but the Native Americans might have given syphilis to us. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6449.56s)]
*  That might have been how syphilis made its way back to Europe. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6453.72s)]
*  There was like two different kinds of syphilis, they think. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6458.88s)]
*  They think one of them, I think they're saying might have come from them fucking animals. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6463.240000000001s)]
*  It's like literal like VD from animals. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6470.36s)]
*  What kind of animal you think? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6473.5599999999995s)]
*  Like sheep and shit like that. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6474.72s)]
*  I can see that. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6476.04s)]
*  Dudes banging sheep. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6477.04s)]
*  I can see that. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6478.04s)]
*  And then they bang people too. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6479.04s)]
*  And they gave everybody syphilis. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6480.04s)]
*  There's like, I believe there's that form. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6481.04s)]
*  And I think there's another form that they think like Columbus might have brought back [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6483.2s)]
*  from, like it's like, it was similar around that time when the syphilis outbreak hit Europe. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6488.32s)]
*  It was when people returned from the New World. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6495.5s)]
*  I wonder if that's been proven yet. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6498.88s)]
*  That's another thing. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6500.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6501.84s)]
*  I'm literally at the point, Joe. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6502.84s)]
*  I don't know what to believe about anything anymore. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6505.0s)]
*  Medieval DNA suggests Columbus didn't trigger syphilis epidemic in Europe. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6507.52s)]
*  And how do you know? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6511.68s)]
*  Skeletons provide first DNA evidence of the diverse strain of syphilis circulated in Europe [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6512.68s)]
*  before 1492. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6517.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6518.64s)]
*  But I think what they're saying is there was always a syphilis, but that syphilis was the [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6519.64s)]
*  that came from fucking animals and that the syphilis that came from North America was [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6524.56s)]
*  different. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6530.0s)]
*  I think that was the thing that I had read. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6531.8s)]
*  You think we're the only species that does that? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6534.36s)]
*  That gives each other VD? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6537.52s)]
*  No. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6538.52s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6539.52s)]
*  Like, like inter animal. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6540.52s)]
*  Like is a zebra gonna check out a hippo? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6542.4s)]
*  There's many videos of like chimps skull fucking a bullfrog. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6544.68s)]
*  Chimps to take a bullfrog and go just shut the fuck up. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=6550.2s)]

*  Conservationist. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7277.64s)]
*  He was very knowledgeable. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7278.64s)]
*  He's great. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7279.64s)]
*  I had an incredible time. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7280.64s)]
*  Where am I going with this? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7281.64s)]
*  Shot a turkey. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7282.64s)]
*  It was easy. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7283.64s)]
*  Yeah, before the turkey though. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7284.64s)]
*  I was talking with... [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7285.64s)]
*  I think he took Theo Vaughn to turkey hunting too. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7286.64s)]
*  Did he take Theo Vaughn hunting? [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7288.64s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7290.68s)]
*  He was right after me. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7291.68s)]
*  Theo landed... [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7292.68s)]
*  That's perfect. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7293.68s)]
*  Turkey's a good thing to shoot because you don't feel bad for them. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7294.68s)]
*  I don't know why. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7297.76s)]
*  It's like you feel bad for a deer that you shoot even though you know that you're going [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7299.280000000001s)]

*  There's a sense of loss with a deer that you don't get with a turkey. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7305.72s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7309.52s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7310.52s)]
*  Now I felt... [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7311.52s)]
*  They blow their brains out with a shotgun and then you're like, all right. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7312.52s)]
*  I felt... [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7316.360000000001s)]
*  It's really funny. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7317.400000000001s)]
*  I was with this guy Ira Dean and Mike and they would laugh their ass off because of [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7318.48s)]
*  their use of this. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7326.92s)]
*  There's a picture of me holding the turkey. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7329.28s)]
*  Oh damn. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7331.5599999999995s)]
*  There it is. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7332.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't think Ira put out the other one. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7335.5599999999995s)]
*  Ira's on the right. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7337.92s)]
*  There's another one. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7339.2s)]
*  It's a big ass turkey. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7340.2s)]
*  Yeah I know they're not going to put... [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7342.2s)]
*  But they didn't show. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7345.16s)]
*  Damn I wish I had the picture. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7346.16s)]
*  You were cuddling the turkey before it died? [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7348.44s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7350.4s)]
*  That's weird. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7351.4s)]
*  That's creepy. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7352.4s)]
*  I just wanted to look at it up close. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7353.4s)]
*  I never saw a turkey up close. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7354.4s)]
*  So I'm looking at them and then while... [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7355.4s)]
*  Yeah man I'm looking at them and I'm feeling it. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7357.84s)]
*  I'm like wow this is what it's like. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7360.08s)]
*  And then Ira would come up and he takes the beak. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7361.88s)]
*  He's like, good shot Jim. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7364.12s)]
*  Trying to have a moment. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7367.12s)]
*  Like I'm going to eat you. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7369.64s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7370.88s)]
*  Nobody would do that with a deer. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7371.88s)]
*  Like hello Jim. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7372.88s)]

*  Don't you feel bad? [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7376.12s)]
*  They wouldn't do that with a deer. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7378.400000000001s)]
*  Like people are more respectful to mammals. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7379.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7381.68s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7382.68s)]
*  Yeah I'm more respectful to mammals for some strange reason. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7383.68s)]
*  Yeah rather than a bird. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7386.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah I feel like zero connection to birds. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7387.68s)]
*  Like I don't want a pet bird. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7389.6s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7391.56s)]
*  Pet dog, pet cat, even pet weird pets. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7392.56s)]
*  Like pet horse. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7395.76s)]
*  I get it. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7397.04s)]
*  Yeah I get it too. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7398.04s)]
*  Yeah but like a pet snake? [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7399.04s)]
*  The fuck are you doing? [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7401.12s)]
*  You got a monster that lives with you. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7402.88s)]
*  You got a monster that you feed. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7404.6s)]

*  Yeah they size you up. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7409.8s)]
*  They size you up. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7410.8s)]
*  And the only reason why they're not eating you is because you're not big enough. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7411.8s)]
*  Or they're not big enough. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7414.6s)]
*  They're not big enough. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7415.6s)]

*  The guy, the python hunting. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7418.6s)]

*  And they're pulling on the ceiling and the pythons were in the ceiling and it collapses. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7437.04s)]
*  And you see like three or four pythons are in his fucking ceiling. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7441.8s)]
*  And they're huge. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7446.5199999999995s)]
*  Huge. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7447.5199999999995s)]

*  And how do I make sure I never go there? [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7451.8s)]

*  They caught one in my development. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7492.759999999999s)]
*  A python? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7495.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7496.759999999999s)]

*  I think it was eighteen feet. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7504.759999999999s)]
*  I think it was eighteen or nineteen feet. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7505.759999999999s)]
*  And they think they get bigger. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7509.16s)]
*  Like they don't even know how big they ultimately get. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7511.759999999999s)]
*  This is not their environment, right? [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7513.96s)]
*  Did you see this video? [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7515.5599999999995s)]
*  What? [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7516.5599999999995s)]

*  Something happened. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7521.76s)]
*  It's at a pet store or something like that. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7522.76s)]
*  Killing over three hundred pythons and a boa constrictor. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7523.76s)]

*  One of these was pregnant and had like fifty in it, inside of it or something. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7528.76s)]
*  So why are they killing these things? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7531.76s)]
*  They're in Florida and they're... [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7532.76s)]
*  Oh, so now you realize he killed the wrong one? [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7534.76s)]
*  The longer video of them killing it is pretty intense. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7537.76s)]
*  I don't need to see that. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7541.76s)]
*  The whole thing is weird that they allowed those exotic pets and then these people just let them go in the swamp. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7544.96s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7550.96s)]
*  And then they just keep multiplying. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7551.96s)]
*  Don't you remember that too? [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7552.96s)]
*  Apparently that's only a part of the problem though. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7553.96s)]
*  I thought that was the whole problem. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7554.96s)]
*  Another part of the problem was that there was a wildlife research facility where they were studying pythons. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7556.96s)]
*  And somehow or another it got destroyed in a storm and the pythons got out. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7563.96s)]
*  Oh, the hurricane Andrew, I think. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7568.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7571.96s)]
*  So yeah, that's also part of the problem. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7573.16s)]
*  So some of it is exotic pets and some of it is these ones that they release from this research facility. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7576.16s)]
*  But it's more mind-boggling to me how just a couple can turn into completely taken over. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7582.16s)]
*  It took over everything because they're invasive. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7589.16s)]
*  Nothing knows to fear them. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7593.16s)]
*  But even when they're little, don't you think... [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7595.16s)]
*  I figure what is the survival rate if they're in the water with gators and you have bobcats? [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7597.36s)]
*  Yeah, hurricane Andrew, it was that. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7603.36s)]
*  That is part of the python problem. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7606.36s)]
*  I think they don't know exactly which percentage comes from the pets from the 1970s and shit, people let go. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7609.36s)]
*  Thousands of specimens of exotic species escaped their cages and enclosures during the passing of the storm through the South Dade County. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7618.36s)]
*  State environmental inspectors reported 10 days after the hurricane, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7626.5599999999995s)]
*  witnesses spotted hundreds of large snakes and non-venomous snakes loose. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7630.5599999999995s)]
*  Wow, hundreds. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7635.5599999999995s)]
*  And now those hundreds are half a million. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7637.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a half a million pythons, they estimate. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7641.5599999999995s)]
*  So because Burmese python invasion of South Florida Everglades, populations of raccoons and opossums dropped roughly 99 percent. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7644.5599999999995s)]
*  And some species of rabbits and foxes effectively disappeared. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7653.76s)]
*  Species that had long flourished here were being decimated by the aggressive newcomers. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7656.76s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7661.76s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7663.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's why it's a free-for-all now. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7665.76s)]
*  It is a free-for-all. You know what else they've spotted in the Everglades? [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7667.76s)]
*  They spotted Nile crocodiles. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7669.76s)]
*  So they don't know how they got in there, they don't know if someone's pet, but they had a kill on sight order for Nile crocodiles. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7672.76s)]
*  They don't know if it's a breeding pair, they don't know. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7679.76s)]
*  They have spotted at least one Nile crocodile in the Everglades. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7682.96s)]
*  Crocodiles are a whole different animal. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7687.96s)]
*  That's a whole different animal. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7689.96s)]
*  That's like a wolf compared to a German shepherd. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7691.96s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7694.96s)]
*  I was in Costa Rica, kids, we were just doing a vacation, staying in whatever. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7696.96s)]
*  And I remember being in the water, in the beach. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7701.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7705.96s)]
*  Yeah, swimming around. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7706.96s)]
*  The beach dropped off where we were, it was like a river that let in the ocean was close. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7709.16s)]
*  It dropped by a little bit. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7714.16s)]
*  I was in there, I was toying around, I wouldn't go too deep and I stayed close. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7716.16s)]
*  And the next day we went back there, it was a big freaking... [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7721.16s)]
*  Crocodile slide. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7725.16s)]
*  No, he was banked on there. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7727.16s)]
*  And I went, oh my god! [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7729.16s)]
*  And I just couldn't believe no one else was in the water. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7731.16s)]
*  Yeah! [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7734.16s)]
*  Dude. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7736.16s)]
*  Yeah! [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7737.16s)]
*  Could have been it. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7738.36s)]
*  It could have been it! [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7739.36s)]
*  Could have been it. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7740.36s)]
*  See that? [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7741.36s)]
*  I'm safe in Florida, kayaking. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7742.36s)]
*  We went on a tour of the crocodile habitat with my kids when they were... [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7744.36s)]
*  The youngest were like six and eight, somewhere around then. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7750.36s)]
*  And it was so creepy, dude. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7755.36s)]
*  Every time they moved, like, get away from the edge, get away from the edge. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7758.36s)]
*  I was so hover parenting. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7762.36s)]
*  And the kids are crazy, like, I want to sit on the railing. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7764.36s)]
*  Fuck no, you can't sit on the railing. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7767.5599999999995s)]
*  Don't do this. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7769.5599999999995s)]
*  If you go in that water, I'm going in that water too and we're both gonna die. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7771.5599999999995s)]
*  You see the guy? [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7775.5599999999995s)]
*  The guy who did that? [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7777.5599999999995s)]
*  What happened? [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7778.5599999999995s)]
*  The guy with the dog? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7779.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah, I did see that. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7780.5599999999995s)]
*  But that was a little one. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7781.5599999999995s)]
*  It was a little dog. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7782.5599999999995s)]
*  Little gator too. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7783.5599999999995s)]
*  Wasn't a big gator. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7784.5599999999995s)]
*  That guy did get his dog back. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7786.5599999999995s)]
*  That guy was a fucking savage. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7788.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know how you did that with your kids, you must have been freaking out. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7790.5599999999995s)]
*  Freaking out. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7793.5599999999995s)]
*  And we saw them. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7794.5599999999995s)]
*  And they slide into the water right in front of you. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7795.5599999999995s)]
*  There was this alligator slide, or crocodile slide rather, so you're on this body of water. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7796.76s)]
*  And then right where the bank is, you see the crocs sunning themselves. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7801.76s)]
*  And then you see them slide into the water. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7806.76s)]
*  It's so creepy. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7808.76s)]
*  It's so creepy. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7810.76s)]
*  Because they're just killing machines. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7812.76s)]
*  And you're in just this fucking boat. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7814.76s)]
*  It's just a boat. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7817.76s)]
*  And you see them on land too. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7819.76s)]
*  You don't think they're fat. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7821.76s)]
*  They can move on land. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7822.76s)]
*  They move. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7823.76s)]
*  They move quick. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7824.76s)]
*  They can run faster than us. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7825.96s)]
*  Wait, what is this? [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7827.96s)]
*  This guy's in their tent and they turn those up. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7829.96s)]
*  It says hundreds of alligators or crocodiles behind them. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7831.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7834.96s)]
*  In their tent. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7835.96s)]
*  So they camped on the beach? [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7836.96s)]
*  They're hanging out. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7838.96s)]
*  Did you see the one on the right? [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7839.96s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7840.96s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7841.96s)]
*  He looks outside his tent. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7842.96s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7843.96s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7844.96s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7845.96s)]
*  You literally camped at the spot where they go. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7848.96s)]
*  What'd they do? [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7851.96s)]
*  They knew he was there and they were going to go eat him. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7852.96s)]
*  What the fuck do you do there? [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7855.16s)]
*  Do you leave? [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7857.16s)]
*  What if you run into another group of them? [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7858.16s)]
*  Higher up the hill. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7861.16s)]
*  Imagine you're out of breath. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7862.16s)]
*  You're running up the hill. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7863.16s)]
*  Running up the hill. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7864.16s)]
*  You get to the top and you realize there's more alligators up there. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7865.16s)]
*  There's ten times the amount. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7868.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7869.16s)]
*  And you're out of breath now. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7870.16s)]
*  You know you can't run. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7871.16s)]
*  I mean you gotta do some research before you go there I think. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7872.16s)]
*  You know what freaks me out more? [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7875.16s)]
*  Young kids. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7876.16s)]
*  They're reckless. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7877.16s)]
*  You know what freaks me out more is the Komodo dragons. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7880.16s)]
*  Oh they're terrifying. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7883.16s)]
*  I follow something with them too. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7884.36s)]
*  They're hard. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7886.36s)]
*  They eat the whole goat. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7887.36s)]
*  Their mouth too. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7889.36s)]
*  That fucking, that shit that drips out. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7890.36s)]

*  No. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7900.36s)]
*  It bit his foot. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7901.36s)]
*  Yeah he went to the zoo. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7902.36s)]
*  There's a follow up. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7903.36s)]
*  The alligators got the tent. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7904.36s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7905.36s)]

*  That is crazy. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7913.5599999999995s)]
*  So they overcame the tent. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7915.5599999999995s)]
*  So this guy just had to run away. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7916.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh they're in Zambia. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7918.5599999999995s)]
*  That was a different story. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7919.5599999999995s)]

*  That's scarier. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7926.2s)]
*  That's way scarier. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7927.32s)]
*  Brazil. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7928.32s)]

*  Does it say? [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7940.98s)]

*  Okay it says. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7949.5199999999995s)]
*  This is a different thing. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7950.5199999999995s)]
*  This is different down here. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7951.5199999999995s)]

*  It says, waking up to find a nest of crocodiles in Vanity's tent. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7955.5199999999995s)]
*  Honestly it seemed to me they looked like alligators. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7959.44s)]
*  Can I see that again? [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7962.2s)]
*  I'm not sure if those were crocodiles. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7964.4s)]
*  All of them are fucking terrifying. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7967.839999999999s)]
*  Those look like alligators. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7968.839999999999s)]
*  They look like alligators. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7969.839999999999s)]
*  Can I see the video again? [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7971.7s)]
*  So here we go. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7974.7s)]
*  We have to watch a Ray-Ban's ad. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7975.7s)]
*  This is his ad. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7977.7s)]
*  Oh this is his TikTok. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7980.7s)]
*  Oh you're never going to find it. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7983.7s)]
*  Where did it go though? [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7988.26s)]
*  You had it before right? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7989.42s)]
*  I just hit it. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7990.42s)]
*  It was playing on the other side. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7991.42s)]
*  Oh there it is. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7992.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7993.42s)]
*  Let me look at those. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7994.42s)]
*  That was it. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7996.42s)]
*  Yeah those are crocodiles. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=7999.0s)]
*  Aren't they? [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8002.0s)]
*  No they're alligators. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8003.0s)]
*  I don't know they look like gators because their snout is round. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8004.0s)]
*  Yeah it's round. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8007.0s)]
*  They look like alligators. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8008.0s)]
*  Anyway he fucked up. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8011.0s)]
*  Whatever they are it's not good. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8013.0s)]
*  It's not good. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8015.0s)]
*  One of my favorite stories I heard about an alligator getting a guy was his cops were [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8016.0s)]
*  on a high speed pursuit with this dude. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8020.24s)]
*  He had a stolen car and he, I think it was a stolen car, anyway he gets to a bridge and [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8021.96s)]
*  jumps off to try to escape and jumps into the water and immediately gets killed by a [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8028.1s)]
*  gator. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8033.1s)]
*  Boom. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8034.1s)]
*  Done. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8035.1s)]
*  Like literally landed next to one. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8036.1s)]
*  He's like oh free lunch. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8037.1s)]
*  Snap. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8038.1s)]
*  There was a guy in Florida I think he was on his bicycle and he tripped. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8039.1s)]
*  Lost thing and he rolled. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8046.66s)]
*  Just perfect place. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8048.820000000001s)]
*  Gator. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8049.820000000001s)]
*  Gator. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8050.820000000001s)]
*  Snap. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8051.820000000001s)]
*  The gator got him. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8052.820000000001s)]
*  I don't think he killed him. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8053.820000000001s)]
*  I think he tore his arm. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8054.820000000001s)]
*  He freaked the gator out. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8057.6s)]
*  Well yeah the gator is just hanging out all of a sudden. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8058.6s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8060.6s)]
*  I think about that too because where I take my bike out the water has gators in it and [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8062.6s)]
*  I'm always like okay maybe I shouldn't mess around. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8070.88s)]
*  How many Florida Panthers are there? [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8073.200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8075.200000000001s)]
*  Are they common? [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8077.200000000001s)]
*  I saw a nice video the other day. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8078.200000000001s)]
*  This guy was turkey hunting and this panther didn't realize he was there and the panther [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8080.04s)]
*  was just walking right by him as he was turkey hunting. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8084.84s)]
*  He's like covered in camo and shit and this turkey is like I mean this panther is walking [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8087.58s)]
*  by his turkey decoy. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8093.22s)]
*  I think that's more in the Everglades area because a lot of Florida is getting built [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8095.5s)]
*  up. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8103.5s)]
*  Even where I'm at I can't believe. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8104.5s)]
*  So many people moved there. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8106.62s)]
*  So many people. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8107.860000000001s)]
*  How many people turned Republican? [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8108.860000000001s)]
*  It had to be more than a million. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8110.860000000001s)]
*  I think I saw something where the ratio too was like 80 to 20. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8112.88s)]
*  Florida is the most red state. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8122.04s)]
*  Yeah like 80% or 70% registered. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8124.48s)]
*  Look how well DeSantis did in the last vote. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8127.16s)]
*  I mean he just destroyed it. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8132.12s)]
*  Destroyed it. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8134.0s)]
*  Like that is a red state now. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8135.0s)]
*  And it's like the most sensible version of how to handle that pandemic. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8138.14s)]
*  People don't want to admit that. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8144.46s)]
*  They want to think that there was something wrong with what they did. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8145.46s)]
*  Like I had this conversation with this one guy who was talking about all these cops that [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8147.66s)]
*  died of COVID and it's the biggest thing. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8151.22s)]
*  They're handling it so poorly. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8153.18s)]
*  I go no it's because the cops are fat man. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8154.18s)]
*  We all know this true story about that. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8157.06s)]
*  We know that. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8159.46s)]
*  I mean everybody knows fat cops. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8160.46s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8161.94s)]
*  That shit is really bad if you're obese. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8162.94s)]
*  What's that Jamie? [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8166.1s)]
*  He barely won. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8167.200000000001s)]
*  This last one? [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8168.200000000001s)]
*  What year is that? [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8169.200000000001s)]
*  2018 I guess. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8170.200000000001s)]
*  No that's it. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8171.200000000001s)]
*  No that one he barely won. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8172.200000000001s)]
*  He barely won when he got into office. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8175.08s)]
*  Yeah and then the other guy got busted. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8176.76s)]
*  Yeah that's 2018. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8178.76s)]
*  Go to the 2022. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8180.200000000001s)]
*  So in 2022 though I think he won by like 65% or something wacky. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8183.04s)]

*  madness. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8268.54s)]
*  It's also a recognition that law enforcement has lost control. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8269.54s)]
*  Like the fact that they can do that and they think they can do that as little kids. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8273.42s)]
*  There's like young teenagers doing this. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8277.7s)]

*  For sure. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8286.24s)]
*  It's happening lots of places. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8287.24s)]
*  And how is no one stopping that? [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8288.679999999998s)]

*  You don't see the organizing on social media? [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8291.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8294.96s)]
*  With everything that's seen on your phone they don't see certain things. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8296.599999999999s)]
*  How do you not see that? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8299.88s)]
*  But I don't think the way the policing is in this country, the way people have lost [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8301.519999999999s)]
*  respect for law enforcement, all that defund the police shit has real consequences. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8306.199999999999s)]
*  And that's one of them. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8311.64s)]
*  You're seeing it right there. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8312.64s)]
*  It's so spooky, man. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8314.380000000001s)]
*  It's so spooky how quickly things can deteriorate. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8315.5s)]
*  But they also dehumanize everything. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8317.900000000001s)]
*  When you're a police officer, what you don't realize is most of the times those cops are [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8320.74s)]
*  the first one to see your dead child. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8326.34s)]
*  You know the trauma that brings? [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8330.18s)]
*  If you got kids at home and you became an officer because you grew up in a nowhere out [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8332.84s)]
*  situation, or maybe your parents got divorced or whatever. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8338.900000000001s)]
*  The only way that you know to survive is you get a pension and blah blah blah and try to [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8343.34s)]
*  take the test. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8348.62s)]
*  You take a test. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8349.62s)]
*  Most people think cops are just, you know, the guys. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8351.34s)]
*  Most of the things they're showing up to is watching people maimed and killed and fighting [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8355.18s)]
*  and beating women. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8360.460000000001s)]
*  The most horror for so many people in the fire department, police, you show up and they're [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8362.58s)]
*  like, yeah, the kid's dead in the back. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8368.42s)]
*  You want to call the mom? [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8370.66s)]
*  You know what kind of, like that's the side that no one will ever talk about. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8371.66s)]
*  And that's the side, you know, you just show a clip that happened at one particular incident [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8377.08s)]
*  and then the demons, we call it news media, the monsters, the creators of pure evil and [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8383.16s)]
*  violence and mind control and emotion control spit out and then boom, they hit the nerve [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8388.96s)]
*  knowing they can manipulate and control and spread violence. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8396.16s)]
*  Well, it's also activists wanted to say that the problem was cops are showing up, law enforcement, [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8400.76s)]
*  for things that should just involve counselors and that these cops are not qualified to do [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8407.76s)]
*  that. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8412.36s)]
*  So they're going to defund that aspect of the police. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8413.36s)]
*  The problem is just that narrative alone devalues the police. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8415.12s)]
*  It's like you put this thing out there that we need to stop funding the police. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8419.84s)]
*  The police are the problem. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8424.04s)]
*  No, the crime is the fucking problem. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8425.04s)]
*  And the problem is no one does a damn thing to prevent long term crime by enriching communities, [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8427.28s)]
*  by going into these places instead of spending 40 billion dollars to fight this fucking proxy [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8433.92s)]
*  war with Ukraine and Russia. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8438.560000000001s)]
*  Instead of doing that, what about fixing these fucking cities that have been economically [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8440.800000000001s)]
*  disenfranchised since who the fuck knows when? [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8445.640000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8449.0s)]
*  Just decade upon decade upon decade of the same kinds of crime in the same neighborhoods. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8450.0s)]
*  And you expect people to come out of that and pull themselves up by their bootstraps. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8454.98s)]
*  It's fucking ridiculous. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8458.699999999999s)]
*  Bro, I remember, I remember the early 90s, I was doing something in Harlem. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8459.699999999999s)]
*  There was a show in Harlem. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8467.58s)]
*  There was a comedy club there, the uptown comedy club. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8468.58s)]
*  I remember that place. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8470.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8471.66s)]
*  And I spent, I learned so much. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8472.66s)]
*  I had the most incredible conversation. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8474.98s)]
*  It was with Tracy Morgan and we were on the street and we just got so open and honest [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8480.3s)]
*  and we just started asking each other questions. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8487.82s)]
*  And when it came to things like welfare, I realized that is such a, that's such a purposely [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8491.179999999998s)]
*  driven, in my opinion, government trap. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8500.14s)]
*  And just the way he was explaining, he's like, you know, if I have a kid, they give me money. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8503.82s)]
*  And he's like, we don't have options. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8508.42s)]
*  They keep us here. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8511.22s)]
*  You know, they put certain foods here. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8512.22s)]
*  They offer to pay us money. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8514.66s)]
*  And I'd love to see the statistic of when welfare came out, how communities thrived [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8516.859999999999s)]
*  or plummeted after that because they didn't have a drive for themselves. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8523.74s)]
*  They had the, they're under the illusion that they're going to be taken care of. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8529.339999999998s)]
*  That is a very dangerous thing for people if you can keep them complacent and like with [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8532.88s)]
*  a certain level of income and just keep that amount of money where they don't have to [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8536.3s)]
*  do anything. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8541.66s)]
*  And a lot of people get conditioned. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8542.66s)]
*  But the other thing is like, how do you get people off of that? [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8546.099999999999s)]
*  Like without extreme willpower and discipline and like working really, really hard to get [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8549.019999999999s)]
*  off of that and then deciding you're not going to accept that money anymore. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8553.74s)]
*  Like for some people, it's easier to just stay in that little system. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8558.14s)]
*  And that goes on in every level. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8562.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8563.98s)]
*  When every finance level you hit, it kind of, I mean, it gets easier at the more finances, [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8565.939999999999s)]
*  but it gets a lot easier. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8571.46s)]
*  It gets a lot easier. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8572.46s)]
*  It's a lot easier. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8573.699999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8574.699999999999s)]
*  But the thing about it is that it's a it's human nature, but B there's a lack of hope. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8575.699999999999s)]
*  So like if you gave that welfare check to places where people are thriving and doing [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8581.279999999999s)]
*  things that they love to do, then it wouldn't be so bad because they just keep doing things [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8585.52s)]
*  they love to do and thriving. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8589.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8591.1s)]
*  And then maybe they would find other stuff to do for a living and they wouldn't need [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8592.1s)]
*  welfare. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8594.26s)]
*  But if you're doing it to people that live in despair, that's when it's sick. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8595.26s)]
*  Like this, there's something sick about it because it's like all you're doing is putting [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8599.82s)]
*  a little bandaid on it and you are giving people food and you are giving people shelter [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8602.82s)]
*  and that is good. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8606.5s)]
*  It's definitely better than them being homeless, but that is not fixing anything. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8607.5s)]
*  And the only way to fix it is to give people hope. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8612.14s)]
*  And you can't have any hope when you live in a community where like everything's fucked. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8614.94s)]
*  Where like everyone's. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8619.7s)]
*  Drugs run rapid. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8620.7s)]
*  Violence. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8621.7s)]
*  Cigarettes. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8622.7s)]
*  Liquor store. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8624.140000000001s)]
*  Everything. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8625.140000000001s)]
*  Everything runs rapid. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8626.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8627.140000000001s)]
*  And that's the real problem. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8628.140000000001s)]
*  The real problem is people have a lack of hope, lack of positive role models. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8629.140000000001s)]
*  Everybody that you know is either involved in crime or the victim of crime or avoiding [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8633.42s)]
*  crime or it's like you're just dealing with constant violence and crime. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8638.42s)]
*  But give me your money and I'll go fix Ukraine. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8642.7s)]
*  It's crazy, right? [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8646.02s)]
*  It's like how do we not address these problems in America? [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8647.5s)]
*  How do we like whatever the debates come up every year? [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8651.38s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8654.82s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8655.82s)]
*  Pro-life, pro-choice. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8656.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8657.82s)]
*  They're like we're going to get jobs. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8658.82s)]
*  Like bitch, you are not. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8659.82s)]
*  We have created so many jobs in this administration. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8663.38s)]
*  We're going to do so much for the military. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8666.939999999999s)]
*  That's one thing I love about the new Twitter. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8669.22s)]
*  When anybody posts something even from the White House, it gets fact checked. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8671.06s)]
*  And the White House is had to pull tweets because they're just bullshit. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8675.9s)]
*  Thank God. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8679.46s)]
*  The baby Jesus. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8680.539999999999s)]

*  The baby Jesus. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8682.539999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8683.539999999999s)]
*  Thank you baby Jesus. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8684.539999999999s)]
*  Thank you baby Jesus. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8685.539999999999s)]
*  Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8688.539999999999s)]
*  That was one of the greatest movies of all time. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8692.539999999999s)]
*  Talladega Nights. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8694.539999999999s)]
*  He is funny. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8695.539999999999s)]
*  Bro. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8696.539999999999s)]
*  He's funny. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8697.539999999999s)]
*  Will Ferrell is funny. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8698.539999999999s)]
*  He's so funny in that movie too. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8699.539999999999s)]
*  How have they not done Talladega Nights 2? [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8702.539999999999s)]
*  Someone please help me out. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8705.539999999999s)]
*  He would go into character and stay in character for a week at a time at Senate Live. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8708.62s)]
*  He would come in, he would wear this vest and he kind of grow his hair a little bit [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8718.54s)]
*  and he wouldn't shave. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8722.54s)]
*  And it would drive people like Marcy Klein, like the producer, like Will, you're representing [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8724.62s)]
*  Senate Live here. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8731.220000000001s)]
*  And we'd all be like oh, is he going to? [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8733.220000000001s)]
*  He'd do that all week. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8736.220000000001s)]
*  So they didn't like the way he was dressed? [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8737.9s)]
*  No, because he would stay like that all week and he'd stay in character. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8738.9s)]
*  Sometimes it would drive you nuts. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8741.9s)]
*  If I want to talk to you and every time I see you you're like I don't know. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8743.9s)]
*  Hello Jim, good to speak to you today. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8748.9s)]
*  Will you be sailing with me this winter? [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8750.9s)]
*  Correct. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8752.9s)]
*  And I go Joe. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8753.9s)]
*  I don't know who this Joe is but I will seek him and tell him you're looking for him. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8754.9s)]
*  I read a story once where John Voight and Angelina Jolie were having a phone call and [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8760.58s)]
*  in the story they were saying that they were talking in character the entire time. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8767.58s)]
*  Like they had a conversation in character. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8771.58s)]
*  I've done that with my daughter. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8774.58s)]
*  We cook on Sundays and we do it for fun. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8776.58s)]
*  Oh, these two. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8779.58s)]
*  Well these two, they're wacky. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8780.58s)]
*  They're not funny. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8781.58s)]
*  Like neither one of them is funny. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8782.58s)]
*  They just did it for the sake of doing it. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8783.58s)]
*  I think they were doing like acting exercises on the phone with each other. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8784.58s)]
*  They were talking in character. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8789.26s)]
*  Exercises, just acting exercises already makes me crack up. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8790.26s)]
*  So part of me is already questioning me being critical of this because now I'm thinking [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8794.26s)]
*  but they are professional actors. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8797.26s)]
*  Would that be fun because you're kind of working with your daughter then. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8798.26s)]
*  You're like working on a little exercise. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8801.26s)]
*  It's like if you were a painter and you painted a thing with your daughter, is that weird? [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8802.26s)]
*  Like why is it weird? [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8806.26s)]
*  Like is the only time you talk you should have to talk like normal? [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8807.26s)]
*  Why shouldn't you be able to talk in character? [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8810.26s)]
*  I think it hides emotions. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8812.26s)]
*  I'm mad at myself for being upset at them. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8813.26s)]
*  I'm looking at them like why am I being so critical of that? [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8816.94s)]
*  They are literally professional actors at the highest level. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8819.94s)]
*  I mean he was in fucking, he was in, wasn't he in, what was John Voight in that one movie [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8822.94s)]
*  with Dustin Hoffman? [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8829.94s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8830.94s)]
*  Midnight Cowboy. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8832.94s)]
*  Oh I don't know if I saw that. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8833.94s)]
*  If I did I don't remember it. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8835.94s)]
*  Dude that's a wild movie. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8837.94s)]
*  Was that Midnight Cowboy? [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8839.94s)]
*  Was that it? [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8841.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8842.94s)]
*  That's a wild movie man. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8843.94s)]
*  That's a movie about like these street hustlers from like the 1970s. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8846.62s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8849.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8850.62s)]
*  Maybe I did see this. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8851.62s)]
*  Yeah John Voight played like some street hustler in New York City. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8852.62s)]
*  I've had to see this. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8856.32s)]
*  Oh it's a great movie man. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8857.32s)]
*  It's like HBO, early 80s. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8858.32s)]
*  Oh no no no no no no. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8861.32s)]
*  69. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8863.32s)]
*  Oh damn. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8864.32s)]
*  Yeah it's a 1969 movie. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8865.32s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8866.32s)]
*  God I haven't seen this in fucking 20 years. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8867.32s)]
*  More. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8869.32s)]
*  Maybe more than 20 years. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8870.32s)]
*  I need to watch it again. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8871.32s)]
*  Did you ever get into westerns? [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8872.32s)]
*  Love westerns. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8874.32s)]
*  Clint Eastwood? [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8875.699999999999s)]
*  You know what I love? [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8876.699999999999s)]
*  The Unforgiven. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8877.699999999999s)]
*  Because that's the most realistic of his westerns. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8878.699999999999s)]
*  That's when he comes, he's like an older guy and it's Morgan Freeman and him and Gene Hackman. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8881.08s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8886.3s)]
*  It's like I think that's the best western of all time. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8887.3s)]
*  Is that the one that opens up and it's like oh no not thinking of the way Metallica opens [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8890.06s)]
*  it up there. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8895.38s)]
*  This is like, this is what it is. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8896.38s)]
*  It's like he did all those spaghetti westerns which were amazing. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8898.3s)]
*  Then he went back and did a real movie on what life in the west was like. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8902.48s)]
*  So instead of it being sort of glossed over spaghetti western like he did with The Good, [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8907.56s)]
*  The Bad, The Ugly and a lot of other things, this one was like horrific. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8912.16s)]
*  Like really probably accurate as to how brutal life in that time period was. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8916.3s)]
*  What did Gene Hackman play in this? [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8923.359999999999s)]
*  Gene Hackman was a sheriff. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8925.44s)]
*  He was like a fucked up asshole of a sheriff that Clint Eastwood winds up killing. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8926.44s)]
*  Spoiler alert. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8930.76s)]
*  I've seen this but I have to watch this again. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8932.62s)]
*  I remember him. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8934.02s)]
*  He gets killed. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8935.02s)]
*  It's a heavy movie man. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8936.02s)]
*  It's a heavy movie. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8937.7s)]
*  The boy gets killed. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8938.7s)]
*  He goes on the, I remember this. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8939.7s)]
*  Clint Eastwood was an assassin when he was younger and he got married and had a family [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8942.82s)]
*  and turned over a new leaf and was running a farm but he was raising his kids and they [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8948.34s)]
*  made him an offer to kill some people that had killed somebody. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8954.62s)]
*  He needed to because his farm was falling apart so he goes back into action. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8958.6s)]
*  But it's believable. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8962.880000000001s)]
*  It's a really good movie. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8964.6s)]
*  It's so different than the style of movies that he used to do about westerns because [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8966.48s)]
*  he flipped it on its head and made it, it's a horrific, it's not in any way glorified. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8971.28s)]
*  Nothing's glorious. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8981.04s)]
*  The people are cowards. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8982.04s)]
*  Everything works and he's reprehensible. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8984.98s)]
*  He's a complete sociopath that is no problem, a psychopath, there's no problem killing people. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8989.98s)]
*  It doesn't raise his heart rate at all. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8996.3s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why he's so good at killing people. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=8998.3s)]
*  He never freaks out. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9000.46s)]
*  He's calm in the face of everything. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9003.46s)]
*  Boom and everybody's stumbling for their gun. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9005.06s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9007.3s)]
*  Boom. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9008.3s)]
*  It's believable. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9009.3s)]
*  It's so creepy and it's so good man. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9010.46s)]
*  It's a fucking great movie. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9013.08s)]
*  I'll have to watch that again. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9014.08s)]
*  I got into, I should have started watching it on a plane because I don't watch a lot [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9015.08s)]
*  of TV. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9019.08s)]
*  What is the series where I'm the worst at this? [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9020.08s)]
*  It was a western and they're settling and they're bringing these people from Denmark [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9024.08s)]
*  or they're Dutch across the country. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9030.56s)]
*  Oh, Deadwood? [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9034.08s)]
*  Yellowstone. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9035.08s)]
*  Yellowstone. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9036.08s)]
*  The early Yellowstones. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9037.08s)]
*  Not Yellowstone but the early ones, like the 18 whatever it is. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9039.58s)]
*  There's like three different Yellowstones that are running now. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9042.58s)]
*  Well, I want to say this one was more recent and it's the guy, you know the guy in Casino [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9045.58s)]
*  that runs, he goes up to De Niro and he's like, I really like you to get my son, I mean [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9051.58s)]
*  my nephew to work again. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9058.38s)]
*  You know that actor? [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9059.78s)]
*  What's his name? [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9060.78s)]
*  Do you know his name? [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9061.78s)]
*  God damn it. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9062.78s)]
*  He's in this movie and he's like taking them across the whole country. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9063.78s)]
*  So it's a movie, it's not a show. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9068.08s)]
*  I'm sorry, it's a series. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9069.08s)]
*  It's a series. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9070.08s)]
*  But I got hooked on his thing because there was some raw stuff in there. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9071.08s)]
*  So is it a Yellowstone, one of the early ones? [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9075.08s)]
*  It's a show with Josh Brolin called Outer Range? [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9077.08s)]
*  I gotta see what it looks like. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9079.08s)]
*  It could be, I think it's Yellowstone. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9081.08s)]
*  Dude, there's so many Yellowstones. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9083.08s)]
*  That Taylor Sheridan is a bad motherfucker. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9085.08s)]
*  This is Outer Range. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9087.08s)]
*  That guy has put together some incredible shows. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9088.08s)]
*  Now. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9090.08s)]
*  Outer Range. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9091.08s)]
*  Josh Brolin is the fucking man, dude. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9092.08s)]
*  That ain't it. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9094.08s)]
*  I love that guy too. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9095.08s)]
*  He's great in everything. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9096.58s)]
*  Josh Bowen? [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9097.58s)]
*  Brolin. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9098.58s)]
*  Brolin. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9099.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9100.58s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9101.58s)]
*  Yellowstone? [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9102.58s)]
*  Kevin Costner. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9103.58s)]
*  It's not the Kevin Costner one. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9104.58s)]
*  Oh, the Kevin Costner one is the shit. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9105.58s)]
*  My wife was watching, I watched a couple of those. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9107.58s)]
*  That's another good movie, Wyatt Earp. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9110.58s)]
*  Wild Overs, yes. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9112.58s)]
*  This is a sci-fi movie too. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9113.58s)]
*  That there, boom, boom. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9115.58s)]
*  It is this one? [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9116.58s)]
*  I feel like this chick was in it. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9117.58s)]
*  This one? [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9119.58s)]
*  Yes, that one. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9120.58s)]
*  Wait, wait, go back. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9121.58s)]
*  I just, yes. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9122.58s)]
*  What is that? [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9123.58s)]
*  That, up there, that. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9124.58s)]
*  1883. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9126.08s)]
*  So yeah, that's the Yellowstone prequel. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9127.08s)]
*  That's like the early days of Yellowstone. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9129.08s)]
*  I've heard that's amazing. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9131.08s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9133.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9134.08s)]
*  That one, maybe because I was on the plane and I was completing the fit. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9135.08s)]
*  That? [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9140.08s)]
*  That's Taylor Sheridan. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9141.08s)]
*  That's the same guy who did Yellowstone, right? [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9142.08s)]
*  He did that as well, right? [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9144.08s)]
*  Dude, he's the fucking man. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9145.08s)]
*  This was so, like you can wrap your head around and go, oh, well this makes more sense how [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9147.08s)]
*  it all went down. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9153.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9154.08s)]
*  It makes all the sense in the world. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9155.08s)]
*  And they, what you were saying with Clint Eastwood, how it's just, they became accustomed [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9156.08s)]
*  to it. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9162.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9163.58s)]
*  Because they would constantly be under attack, whether it was just for their supplies or [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9164.58s)]
*  they wanted their girls, and they weren't worried about natives, they were more worried [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9167.58s)]
*  about- [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9172.08s)]
*  Yeah, other outlaws. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9173.08s)]
*  Bunch of monsters out there. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9174.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9176.58s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9177.58s)]
*  That makes more sense. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9178.58s)]
*  It was so good, coming to steal your cattle or coming to steal your horses. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9179.58s)]
*  The Wild West, man. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9182.58s)]
*  I mean, that's really what it was. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9184.08s)]
*  And those people made it across the country. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9185.08s)]
*  There were so many fucking bad people. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9186.58s)]
*  There were so many outlaws. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9188.58s)]
*  And just horrific conditions and no law enforcement and just fucking chaos. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9190.08s)]
*  Well, there's a scene in there, and it actually reminded me, when I watched you last night, [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9194.08s)]
*  you did something last night. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9199.58s)]
*  There's a little part of one of the sets, and you're talking about the tribal, like [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9201.58s)]
*  we used to, oh, you were like, we used to be able to just maim and kill. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9207.58s)]
*  For most of history, it was very horrific. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9213.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9216.08s)]
*  Well, there's a scene in here that I thought, it was described by the female who, she's [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9217.08s)]
*  already lost, I don't want to get too much away, but she's seen enough. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9222.58s)]
*  She's like a kid, she fell in love, but towards the end, she falls in love and this guy's [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9228.08s)]
*  protecting her and she's describing almost what a turn on in the power of this guy. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9234.08s)]
*  Like the aggressive, revengeful anger of him just hatching this other guy, and you [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9241.08s)]
*  don't even feel bad, you're like, you know what? [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9253.08s)]
*  A fucker deserves to be hatched up for what he did. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9255.58s)]
*  And she's watching, and this becomes the norm, just boom. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9259.58s)]
*  Killing someone with an axe. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9264.58s)]
*  Gosh, took him out. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9266.08s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9267.58s)]
*  Took him out. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9268.58s)]
*  Something about axe murderer, it's like a very specific kind of murderer. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9270.08s)]
*  So barbaric. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9275.08s)]
*  Because literally, it's the only kind of murderer where you have a definition, like you have [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9276.08s)]
*  that word connected, like axe murderer. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9280.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9283.08s)]
*  No one calls you a gun murderer. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9284.08s)]
*  That's right. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9285.08s)]
*  But an axe murderer is a very specific definition. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9286.08s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9288.08s)]
*  It is interesting. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9289.08s)]
*  Knife murderer. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9290.08s)]
*  No. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9291.08s)]
*  Poison murderer. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9292.08s)]
*  Nope. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9293.08s)]
*  Axe murderer. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9294.08s)]
*  Poison murderer is a specifically brutal way to kill someone. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9295.58s)]
*  And it's terrifying for people, because they don't feel like they could do anything about [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9299.58s)]
*  it. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9302.58s)]
*  No. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9303.58s)]
*  Someone's coming at you with an axe, like Jesus Christ, you don't have much room for [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9304.58s)]
*  error. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9307.58s)]
*  I've seen videos, but I know I'm not going to be able to pull it off under pressure. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9308.58s)]
*  Yeah, dude, it's too scary. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9310.58s)]
*  You're supposed to get close. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9311.58s)]
*  Yeah, good luck with that. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9312.58s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9313.58s)]
*  Get close. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9314.58s)]
*  Good luck. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9315.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9316.58s)]
*  But the way she describes it, it reminds me of what you just said. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9317.58s)]
*  It just becomes something. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9321.58s)]
*  Well, that's how human beings existed for thousands and thousands of years. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9325.08s)]
*  They existed in these... [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9331.08s)]
*  I mean, when you go back and listen to accounts of history... [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9332.08s)]
*  How long do you think that lasted to? [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9335.08s)]
*  And where did it last to? [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9337.08s)]
*  Like, did that last... was that going on... [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9338.08s)]
*  I have a very specific explanation for it, I think. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9341.08s)]
*  I think it has to do with the Younger Dryas Impact Theory. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9347.08s)]
*  I think that human beings, especially in Africa, had achieved an insanely high level of sophistication. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9350.58s)]
*  What they had done in Egypt is still, to this day, one of the most confusing things that [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9357.58s)]
*  anyone's ever been able to accomplish. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9362.58s)]
*  And the fact that these people were able to accomplish it 4,000, 5,000 years ago, or more, [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9364.58s)]
*  they don't even know really how old some of that stuff is. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9370.58s)]
*  I think that when the asteroids impacted and the Ice Age ended, and there's a lot of evidence of this, [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9375.08s)]
*  like physical evidence all over the Earth, that they were smashed by asteroids, [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9380.08s)]
*  I think it knocked human beings back into the fucking Stone Age. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9384.08s)]
*  And I think the people that survived had to survive in the most brutal and barbaric conditions, [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9388.08s)]
*  where society was completely eroded, where it was just chaos. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9394.08s)]
*  Most people were dead, and you survived if you were underground, you survived if you had gotten into caves, [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9399.58s)]
*  you survived if you had accumulated enough resources so you could make it through [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9405.58s)]
*  whatever amount of nuclear winter exists, pelted by giant rocks from space [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9410.58s)]
*  that literally ended the Ice Age and killed 65% of all the megafauna in North America. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9416.58s)]
*  65% of all the mammals died off quick. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9423.58s)]
*  Whether it's woolly mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, 65% of them just got wiped out in a very short period of time. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9427.08s)]
*  Probably because there was no food left over, probably because a lot of them got killed on the initial impact [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9433.08s)]
*  and through the floods, and all this shit that happened when the ice caps melted. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9438.08s)]
*  And I think that the reason why people were so barbaric 3,000, 4,000 years ago, [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9442.08s)]
*  I think that's the ancestors of the people that survived that disaster. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9447.08s)]
*  And I think they had to be monsters. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9452.08s)]
*  I bet the early days there was a lot of cannibalism. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9454.58s)]
*  I bet people did whatever the fuck they could to just exist. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9457.58s)]
*  Right after the impacts, whatever people were left, I bet there was very few people left, [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9461.58s)]
*  and I bet their lives were hard as fuck. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9467.58s)]
*  I think that still exists, to a degree. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9470.58s)]
*  Well, it definitely still exists to a degree. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9473.58s)]
*  It still exists, but they don't need no Ice Age to still act like that or have that built inside them. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9475.58s)]
*  Sure, but what I'm thinking is one of the reasons why you have such sophistication, [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9481.08s)]
*  like 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 years ago, 10,000 years ago, [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9485.08s)]
*  then you have like thousands of years later sheer barbarism. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9490.08s)]
*  How'd that happen? Because I think everything was stopped. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9494.08s)]
*  I think it all stopped, and I think the people were left in a fucking Mad Max world for a long ass time. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9497.08s)]
*  When they talk about civilization restarting, right? [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9504.08s)]
*  So if this happened 11,800 years ago, which is what they think happened, [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9507.58s)]
*  the earliest instances up until these theories of modern civilization was 6,000 years ago. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9511.58s)]
*  That's Sumer. That's first mathematics, first written language. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9517.58s)]
*  A lot of different things come out of this one part of the world. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9521.58s)]
*  But that's 5,000 years after the impacts. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9525.58s)]
*  So what if you have this sophisticated society of people that are operating probably at a higher level than we are now, [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9531.08s)]
*  just through some technology that we don't understand, and they get fucking annihilated by rocks from space, [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9538.08s)]
*  and then whoever does exist, they exist in a horrific way for thousands of years before people reinvent civilization? [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9545.08s)]
*  I don't know. It's all too much for me. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9555.08s)]
*  I get that. I just don't know. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9558.58s)]
*  That's a good way to talk about that. I don't know either. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9561.58s)]
*  But it's one of my favorite subjects. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9566.58s)]
*  No, I know. Me too. It's fascinating. I always want to know where do certain things start. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9568.58s)]
*  Where does that start, and how did it spread? [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9573.58s)]
*  Why do I keep fucking up Graham Hancock's series? It's ancient apocalypse, right? [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9577.58s)]
*  I always say ancient catastrophe. I almost said it again. But it is apocalypse. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9581.58s)]
*  Ancient apocalypse on Netflix. Watch it. It's amazing. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9586.08s)]
*  It's a series of where Graham Hancock, who's the master of this stuff, who really understands it better than anybody, [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9589.08s)]
*  and Randall Carlson, who's the master of it, he really understands the asteroid impacts and the impact theory. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9594.08s)]
*  And they put this together and they say there's like distinct evidence of a very advanced culture that we have no explanation for. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9600.08s)]
*  And it exists all over the world. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9607.08s)]
*  There's these stone structures in the Pacific that are so complex and we don't know who did them, [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9609.08s)]
*  we don't know how they moved them. And all this evidence seems to point to that. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9613.58s)]
*  At one point in time, human beings had reached a very high level of sophistication for design, for construction, [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9618.58s)]
*  for the ability to move stones and cut them. It's really high levels of construction. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9625.58s)]
*  To the point where you're getting all these stones to meet perfectly at the top of a massive pyramid. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9631.58s)]
*  That's 2,300,000 stones. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9637.58s)]
*  Well, not only that, it's mind-boggling to think they're also in Mexico and possibly be buried under a mountain [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9642.08s)]
*  that looks like a mountain, but it's actually another pyramid that everything grew over. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9652.08s)]
*  Exactly. It's all through the Amazon they find those too. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9658.08s)]
*  Right. That's mind-boggling to me. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9661.08s)]
*  Mind-boggling. All through the Amazon it's filled with these structures. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9663.08s)]
*  They use LIDAR and they scan the surface of the ground and they find irrigation tracks and plots of land and grids for a city. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9667.58s)]
*  Wild shit, man. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9675.58s)]
*  Do you go to Egypt? [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9677.58s)]
*  I have not been. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9679.58s)]
*  I want to go. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9681.58s)]
*  I went there and they were...I don't know, man, it's wild. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9683.58s)]
*  It's also weird to see...what the hell is that thing in Washington, D.C., the pointy thing. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9687.58s)]
*  Oh, the obelisk. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9694.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9697.08s)]
*  What is the meaning of that? Why is that in D.C.? It was in Egypt. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9698.08s)]
*  It's in Rome as well. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9703.08s)]
*  It's in Rome. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9704.08s)]
*  There's an Egyptian obelisk that's in Rome in the middle of the Vatican. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9705.08s)]
*  That fascinates me. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9709.08s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9710.08s)]
*  What's the connection on the three of them and why is it in D.C.? [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9711.08s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9715.08s)]
*  The original obelisks, man, when they find ones that they didn't wind up using because there's a crack, [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9716.08s)]
*  and you see them carved out of stone, you're like, how the fuck were you going to move this? [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9721.08s)]
*  What did you do? How did you do this? [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9726.58s)]
*  I started seeing stuff like that because I remember my mom would talk about the World Fair. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9728.58s)]
*  Oh, the Chicago thing where they turned on the lights for the first time? [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9733.58s)]
*  No, I saw that one too. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9737.58s)]
*  I think there was one in New York, but then I saw the thing in Chicago where they built everything up [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9740.58s)]
*  and it looked like a city and then just got rid of it like it was nothing. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9747.58s)]
*  Yeah, what was it? Was it a facade? Did they build a facade? [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9752.58s)]
*  I don't know. Was that a Disney set type thing or was that the real deal going down? [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9756.08s)]
*  Some shady contracting deal going on there for sure in Chicago. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9760.08s)]
*  100% that was the mob. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9764.08s)]
*  Hey, we got to take it down now. We got a fucking contract there. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9766.08s)]
*  The contract is we build and then we take it down. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9770.08s)]
*  Come on, I told you, we made a fucking deal. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9772.08s)]
*  Don't make me come visit you. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9775.08s)]
*  I put the Caesar up, I put everything you said. Look, I'm going to make it all nice and everything. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9777.08s)]
*  Don't make me come visit you, you piece of shit. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9781.08s)]
*  Take it down. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9784.58s)]
*  The Vatican is insane, dude. Have you been there? [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9785.58s)]
*  I have not. I went to Rome, but I didn't visit the Vatican. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9787.58s)]
*  God, you got to go next time. I went and I had a really cool guide. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9791.58s)]
*  We hired a professor. He was this multi-language speaking professor. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9795.58s)]
*  Really interesting dude. And he got really into it with me. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9801.58s)]
*  We really, really got into all these different things. He was so knowledgeable. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9805.58s)]
*  It was really cool. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9809.58s)]
*  Do you know who you were? [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9811.58s)]
*  Did he know who you were? [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9813.08s)]
*  Yeah, he knew who I was. Yeah, he was really cool. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9814.08s)]
*  He just gave me the lowdown on, first of all, why they all have little dicks. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9818.08s)]
*  I was like, why they all have little dicks? [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9824.08s)]
*  He told me that they thought that a large penis was brutish and barbaric. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9828.08s)]
*  And they were like, some dude with a little dick had conned everybody into thinking little dicks were shit. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9833.08s)]
*  Simple propaganda. Total propaganda. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9838.08s)]
*  It's like Little Dick Guy is like, you don't want that big dick. The big dick is nothing but problems. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9841.58s)]
*  The big dick doesn't come with culture or agriculture. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9846.58s)]
*  The civilization that we've created, this beautiful city, relies on little dick. Little dick energy. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9849.58s)]
*  Start building these things everywhere. I need statues of little dicks on every corner. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9855.58s)]
*  They had legit little dick energy. And after a while, somewhere along the line, I forget what the explanation was, [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9859.58s)]
*  they started covering them up with leaves. They started covering the dicks up with leaves. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9864.58s)]
*  So there would be this beautiful body, this perfect man with this little leaf over it. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9869.08s)]
*  Little leaf. That guy had a hog on him. Look at the size of that guy. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9873.08s)]
*  Little leaf dick. I saw that. It's weird. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9877.08s)]
*  Very rare that a guy built a Greek god as a little tiny dick. I just don't think those things go together. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9879.08s)]
*  Like are they messing with it? [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9884.08s)]
*  He's messing with his hands and his shoulders. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9885.58s)]
*  Right, but a little dick. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9887.58s)]
*  A monster hog. No, little tiny ass dick. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9889.58s)]
*  You need a little dick. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9892.08s)]
*  Yes, little dicks are the way to go. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9893.08s)]
*  Whatever little dick energy dude who was running Rome at the time was like, [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9895.58s)]
*  No, no, no. What? Two inches? Are you insane? Nobody needs two inches. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9900.58s)]
*  It's like you don't need an AR-15. That's like the same people today. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9909.58s)]
*  What do you need an AR-15 to protect yourself? That's a military assault rifle. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9913.58s)]
*  Two inches. One inch is plenty to pleasure every woman that's ever existed. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9918.58s)]
*  One inch is fine. They give him these little one inch penises. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9923.58s)]
*  Giant goliath of a man. Full six pack. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9927.08s)]
*  Looks like a fucking, literally looks like a superhero. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9931.08s)]
*  Put that leaf over it. Cover his penis with a leaf. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9934.08s)]
*  Just so weird. And there's so much art dude. There's so much art. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9939.08s)]
*  You're blown away. I mean, you know there's so much art when you get there. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9943.08s)]
*  But then when you're wandering around you're like, what in the fuck man? This is nuts. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9948.08s)]
*  The arena. Oh, the Colosseum. Right, the Colosseum. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9952.58s)]
*  Yeah, the Colosseum was incredible. That's incredible. All of it's incredible. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9955.58s)]
*  I mean, if you could go back and see what that was like when the emperor of Rome was presiding over the Colosseum [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9959.58s)]
*  and they got people gladiator fights and they're letting tigers loose and shit. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9965.58s)]
*  Like, what the fuck man? They had the animals in cages underneath the floor [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9969.58s)]
*  and they would raise the cage up and let the animal out. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9976.58s)]
*  What's the movie? Gladiator. Russell Crowe. The shit. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9980.08s)]
*  Monster movie. The shit. That was a monster movie. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9983.08s)]
*  That movie was so good. Oh my god. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9986.08s)]
*  I cried like a baby at the end of the movie. Oh my god. I open mouth cried. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9989.08s)]
*  Everybody wanted to be Russell Crowe. Are you not entertained? [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9994.08s)]
*  Remember that? So good. Oh my god. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=9999.08s)]
*  And then Joaquin Phoenix perfectly plays. He was great. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10003.08s)]
*  He perfectly plays the creepy dictator. He was such a dick. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10008.58s)]
*  Oh my god, he was so good. So good and so beautiful at the time. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10012.58s)]
*  Right? Imagine if that's the guy who becomes the Joker. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10015.58s)]
*  Look how beautiful he was. Dude, he's a great actor. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10018.58s)]
*  Oh my god, he's incredible. That guy's an unbelievable actor. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10020.58s)]
*  He freaked me out in the Joker because I was like, this could happen. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10023.58s)]
*  I think he's partially responsible for the Antifa riots. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10026.58s)]
*  I think people saw that and they're like, that looks like fun. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10029.58s)]
*  We need a real Joker. You know when these guys are out there like aspiring to be the real Joker? [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10033.08s)]
*  They're going to do Joker part two, which is great. Good job Todd Phillips. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10040.08s)]
*  I'm going to send this further into demise. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10045.08s)]
*  It's the ultimate anti-hero. They are filming it next year, right? With Lady Gaga. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10049.08s)]
*  It's happening right now. Oh god. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10052.08s)]
*  It's beautiful too. Yeah dude, it's um. I can't. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10054.08s)]
*  It's going to be so intense. It's going to be good. It's going to be amazing. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10057.08s)]
*  But isn't it funny that Todd Phillips had to stop making comedies because the world got too woke? [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10062.58s)]
*  Like the kind of comedies that he made before. If you tried to make them today, you'd get in real trouble. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10066.58s)]
*  Todd Phillips was so. What was that first one? Was Hangover his first one? What was his first one? [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10070.58s)]
*  I don't know. That was him, Hangover, right? Yeah, that's him. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10076.58s)]
*  Let's go to his IMDB. Check my IMDB. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10079.58s)]
*  Check my IMDB. What have you ever done? What have you ever done, Jim? [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10085.58s)]
*  I just checked my IMDB. I was half-baked. You fucking piece of shit. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10090.08s)]
*  Yeah, his first move was Road Trip and then Old School. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10095.08s)]
*  Oh wow. So he did some classics. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10097.08s)]
*  So he went right from there. Road Trip and Old School. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10100.08s)]
*  Old School right out of the gate. Oh my god. Right out of the gate. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10103.08s)]
*  Right out of the gate. There's a drive and the left fielder doesn't even move. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10106.08s)]
*  But I think he did an interview where he was talking about the difficulties of doing those kind of comedies today. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10110.08s)]
*  I guess so. What was so offensive in? [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10115.58s)]
*  Everything. Try watching them again. Try watching Step Brothers. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10120.58s)]
*  You watch Step Brothers, you're like, Jesus, the language. There's so many of those things you cannot say today. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10125.58s)]
*  Is the Hangover offensive? Yeah. That's what I'm saying. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10130.58s)]
*  Perfectly. It's raunchy, but it's not offensive. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10133.58s)]
*  That's what I say. I say raunchy, but I don't think there's anything. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10138.58s)]
*  It was rated R. I think that was the only thing that was big about it. Nothing cancelable. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10140.58s)]
*  Well, doesn't Dr. Ken pull his dick out? Whatever that was. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10143.08s)]
*  Remember he's got a micropenis? Do you think that was really his dick? [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10148.08s)]
*  If it is, that's so rude. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10151.08s)]
*  I feel like, listen, we don't even have to do any special effects. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10154.08s)]
*  I don't want to. No showing my dick. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10158.08s)]
*  Maybe it really is his dick. It could be. Could be. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10161.08s)]
*  Could be. I mean, if you go in for the laugh and you think... [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10165.08s)]
*  If he was the king of the world, everybody would have a little dick on a statue. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10168.08s)]
*  That's right. So he may be on to something. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10171.58s)]
*  Maybe having the baby is a big problem. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10174.58s)]
*  That's a little bit of an issue. That's normal though. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10177.58s)]
*  That movie, when I saw that in theaters, that's another one where it's hard to get me into belly laugh. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10180.58s)]
*  I was belly laughing. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10186.58s)]
*  How about something about Mary? Remember that? [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10188.58s)]
*  That was... Fairly Brothers? [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10190.58s)]
*  Yes. The jizz in the hair? [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10192.58s)]
*  And what's his name? Oh my God. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10194.58s)]
*  And he kept having a pimple in a different spot. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10198.58s)]
*  Chris Elliott. Yes. Chris Elliott had a weird... [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10201.08s)]
*  And how funny was Damon? [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10204.08s)]
*  Yeah. No, not Dillon. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10207.08s)]
*  Not Dillon? Yeah. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10209.08s)]
*  The cop? Yeah. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10211.08s)]
*  The kids that feel better. He was funny in that. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10213.08s)]
*  I miss those kind of movies. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10217.08s)]
*  I do too. So funny. Kingpin? [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10219.08s)]
*  Kingpin was hilarious. Oh my God. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10222.08s)]
*  Hilarious. I miss those kind of movies. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10225.08s)]
*  They don't really make that many of those. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10227.58s)]
*  It used to be there was a lot of banger comedies that would come out every year. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10229.58s)]
*  I would say Anchorman is the closest thing to that silly ensemble. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10232.58s)]
*  And you're invested, no matter how silly the character is, you're invested in him. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10238.58s)]
*  Sandler still does them. He's seen great, great silly movies. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10242.58s)]
*  He's the king of silly movies. He's the king. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10246.58s)]
*  King of silly movies. It's always funny to me, critics review his movie poorly. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10248.58s)]
*  It's a perfect Adam Sandler movie, you idiot. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10252.58s)]
*  You know, if you don't like Happy Gilmore, you can go fuck yourself. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10255.08s)]
*  You don't like that movie? [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10260.08s)]
*  Do you know what you're signing up for? [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10262.08s)]
*  It's not like you go to a fucking Jojo Siwa concert and you're looking to see Pink Floyd. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10264.08s)]
*  You went to the wrong place. It's an Adam Sandler movie and they're awesome. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10269.08s)]
*  You just gotta be in the mood for like The Zohan. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10274.08s)]
*  Right, I'm not here for Raging Bull. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10277.08s)]

*  What is Spanglish? I'm not aware of that one. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10343.58s)]
*  I feel like, and he was more serious than he was really good in. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10345.58s)]

*  You go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't fucking do this. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10387.08s)]

*  Yeah, people told me about it and I put it off. And then when I finally watched it, I was like, holy shit. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10400.58s)]
*  I get home Sunday night that we're watching that movie. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10405.58s)]
*  Yeah, my wife didn't even enjoy it. It gave her anxiety. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10410.58s)]
*  Really? [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10413.58s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10414.58s)]
*  Then that means it's really good. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10415.58s)]
*  It's so good, dude. It's so good. And Adam Sandler plays a gambling... [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10416.58s)]
*  You ever been around gambling junkies? [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10421.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10423.08s)]
*  He plays it perfect. He's just like, this next one, I got this fucking next one, I'm gonna shove it up everybody's fucking ass. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10424.08s)]
*  It's amazing. It's so good. That's those guys, man. Those guys that get addicted to sports gambling. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10431.08s)]
*  Holy fuck, those guys are just degenerates. It is just a roller coaster ride of emotions and they can't stop. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10437.08s)]
*  They can't stop. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10445.08s)]
*  They're so addicted to that rush. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10446.08s)]
*  I know a guy who lost a lot of money. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10448.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10450.58s)]
*  Like quarter of a million dollars. I'm sure this guy said, but for a guy of his status to lose that... [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10451.58s)]
*  I remember there was a guy even, I went to, I think I was filming a pilot or something. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10456.58s)]
*  And I said, guy, you gotta come out for this pilot. And I flew him out, blah, blah, blah. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10463.58s)]
*  And he was gone until like five in the morning. He came back. He said, guy, I was at the casino. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10467.58s)]
*  There's a casino in LA? Somewhere out there. And he found it. And he said, it was probably like an hour away. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10472.08s)]
*  He found it. We'd show up at five in the morning. When those guys are in... [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10480.08s)]
*  You're in LA. You're going to California. You're going to Hollywood. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10484.08s)]
*  So many things you can do. You're looking for stars. You're gonna go see the mountains. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10488.08s)]
*  You're gonna take a ride on the hills, mohaw and anything. All he wanted to do was find a casino. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10493.08s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10499.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty, it's sad. He beat it. I think he beat it. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10500.58s)]
*  It's hard to beat because that rush, the thing that they get out of it is like regular life seems very boring if you don't have like a big bet on the line. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10503.58s)]
*  Like every day there's a bet. And every day you're trying to get even or you're trying to get better. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10511.58s)]
*  You're trying to get that money back. And people are trying to get you because you have loans out. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10517.58s)]
*  And so you have to run away. So it's this wild adventure. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10521.58s)]
*  That's when it gets intense. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10526.58s)]
*  And in New York they have off track betting. Right? So there's betting everywhere. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10528.08s)]
*  In New York you can go bet on the horse races. You can bet on dog races. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10532.08s)]
*  We had a relationship and it was... [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10536.08s)]
*  You bet on dog races still? [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10541.08s)]
*  They used to be in Florida. I've never seen that in Florida. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10543.08s)]
*  Do they still do that? [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10546.08s)]
*  Because I know there's like a lot of animal cruelty people wanted to stop that. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10548.08s)]
*  They do them here in Texas? Oh Jesus Christ. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10552.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I don't know. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10555.58s)]
*  Let me retract. It says dog racing is illegal in seven states. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10558.58s)]
*  All dog tracks have been closed and cease live racing. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10563.58s)]
*  But a prohibitory statute has been enacted. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10566.58s)]
*  Those states include Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Kansas, Iowa, Texas, and Wisconsin. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10570.58s)]
*  So those are the places where you can still? [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10575.58s)]
*  Yeah. But do they do it? [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10578.58s)]
*  This video is from last year. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10581.58s)]
*  Oh my God. This is last year? [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10584.08s)]
*  They put a wire mesh over the dog's face too and make him run. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10588.08s)]
*  Look at how fast they run. Look at how fast that thing runs. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10592.08s)]
*  Look how fast those motherfuckers go. That is so insane. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10596.08s)]
*  Oh my God. Look at the one on the outside coming in. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10599.08s)]
*  Bro they're so fast. So fast. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10602.08s)]
*  This guy's getting tired. The dude in the front is getting tired. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10605.08s)]
*  But look at him go. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10608.08s)]
*  Wow. He just got a last burst of energy. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10609.08s)]
*  He did. He felt them on his ass. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10611.08s)]
*  He did. He even glanced back and saw them. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10613.08s)]
*  They're still going. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10615.58s)]
*  How long do they run for? [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10616.58s)]
*  How long do they run for? [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10617.58s)]
*  So are they chasing a thing? [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10619.58s)]
*  That one no. Sometimes they chase a little rabbit. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10621.58s)]
*  This time they're just running. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10623.58s)]
*  They're just running. I felt like he glanced at one right before that turn. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10624.58s)]
*  Jesus dude. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10628.58s)]
*  They're on me. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10629.58s)]
*  Do they have a thing over their mouth while they're running? No. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10630.58s)]
*  No. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10632.58s)]
*  Wow. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10633.58s)]
*  Yeah there's something that creeps people out about dogs running. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10636.58s)]
*  Because that dog could just be your pet. Like why you have one run? [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10639.58s)]
*  Maybe that's what...horses? [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10643.08s)]
*  The dude run with a thing over their face. Look at that. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10644.08s)]
*  So I guess different rules, different places. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10647.08s)]
*  Wow. That's probably so they don't bite each other. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10649.08s)]
*  They probably get mad that one dude won the race and tried to sucker punch him. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10651.08s)]
*  Bite his ear with his eye. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10657.08s)]
*  That kind of shit happens man. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10659.08s)]
*  You gotta be careful. competitive dogs. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10661.08s)]
*  Gives him a little crotch bite right before the thing takes off and all that. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10664.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10668.58s)]
*  Alligator racing wouldn't bother me at all. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10669.58s)]
*  Race those fucking assholes. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10672.58s)]
*  I'd like to see that go down. Little alligator racing. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10673.58s)]
*  How'd you get them to run? [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10676.58s)]
*  Put a little muscle around them. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10677.58s)]
*  You have to starve them. [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10678.58s)]
*  Put chicken. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10679.58s)]
*  Yeah you have to starve them. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10680.58s)]
*  Yeah you're starting to put a stick with a chicken or something like that. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10681.58s)]
*  And run with a horse dragging a chicken behind it. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10682.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10684.58s)]
*  But if the horse trips. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10685.58s)]
*  Horse breaks its leg. You're pinned under the horse. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10687.58s)]
*  And the alligators start running on you. Nobody's gonna feel bad for you. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10689.58s)]

*  You know how scary that would be? [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10704.08s)]
*  If you starved them so that you could do this. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10705.08s)]
*  Cause you have to starve them for a long time. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10708.08s)]
*  Cause alligators and crocodiles I think they can go a year without eating. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10710.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10716.08s)]

*  They have like the little dens they dig in the ground. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10744.58s)]
*  Steve Rinella just sent me this video of this gator running out of this little area he's in. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10746.58s)]

*  But still I see how it went down. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10809.08s)]
*  Well the guy when we were at Disney World the guy was they have like a whole fishing [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10813.08s)]

*  It's just so interesting that you just get accustomed to being around monsters. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10835.58s)]

*  If that horse fucks up and gets one of his legs clamped down on. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10904.08s)]

*  Some people do kill them. [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10934.08s)]
*  It's wild horses will like compete with domestic cattle and a lot of other animals for resources. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10936.08s)]
*  You know they could they could reigning in the wild horse crisis. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10944.08s)]
*  Here it goes. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10948.08s)]
*  See. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10949.08s)]
*  Two thousand horses and burros. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10950.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10952.08s)]
*  Certainly stands at twenty six thousand animals. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10953.08s)]
*  Look at this Bureau of Land Management the federal agency charged with managing the animals sets an appropriate population level for wild horses based on the amount of rangeland available. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10956.08s)]
*  A figure that currently stands at twenty six thousand seven hundred and eighty five animals. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10966.08s)]
*  Today there is an estimated eighty two thousand wild horses and burros on public rangelands. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10970.08s)]
*  More than three times the designated level. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10977.08s)]
*  Even more challenging due to the high fertility of the wild equines the population is on pace to double every four years. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10979.08s)]
*  Wow. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10986.08s)]

*  Do you know the wild horses horses actually originated in North America. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10991.08s)]
*  And then they died off in that mass depopulation of mega fauna and then they were reintroduced to North America by Europeans. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=10996.08s)]
*  Like all the horses in Africa like all wild horses and horses originated right here. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11006.08s)]
*  Now wild. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11012.08s)]
*  Well the native the natives use the horses. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11013.08s)]
*  They didn't use the horses until the Europeans gave it to them. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11016.08s)]
*  Really. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11019.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11020.08s)]
*  They didn't have horses. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11021.08s)]
*  Nope. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11022.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11024.08s)]
*  Pretty wild. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11025.08s)]
*  The Comanche learned horse rearing. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11026.08s)]
*  That's the reason why the Comanche were able to take over like most of the Great Plains. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11028.08s)]
*  Like not even in South America they have horses like when you use donkeys. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11032.08s)]
*  When Cortez invaded the Aztecs. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11037.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11040.08s)]
*  One of the things they were freaked out about that he was on a horse. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11041.08s)]
*  They thought they were like gods. [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11043.08s)]
*  They were riding horses. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11045.08s)]
*  Yeah that would freak me out. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11047.08s)]
*  I can't imagine that. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11048.08s)]
*  That would freak me out. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11049.08s)]
*  What's crazy is they started here. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11050.08s)]
*  Horses started here. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11051.08s)]
*  They were wiped out and then reintroduced by the Europeans. [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11052.08s)]
*  And now you've got a giant population of wild ones. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11055.08s)]
*  Huh. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11058.08s)]
*  Pretty interesting. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11059.08s)]
*  But god damn. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11060.08s)]
*  Imagine just being in the wild and seeing like a group of wild horses running by. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11061.08s)]
*  That would be amazing. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11066.08s)]
*  It would be pretty awesome. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11067.08s)]
*  Pretty fucking amazing. [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11068.08s)]
*  There's a presence too. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11069.08s)]
*  Like I was on the outer banks and there's if you go the area where there's no roads [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11070.08s)]
*  or whatever you go to and you'll just see like a herd of horses just kind of hanging [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11077.08s)]
*  out around your house. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11083.08s)]
*  It brings this like bizarre peace inside. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11086.08s)]
*  I can't explain it. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11090.08s)]
*  They're a fucking cool animal. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11091.08s)]
*  It's majestic looking. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11093.08s)]
*  And you feel something when I can't explain it. [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11095.08s)]
*  Pause there's something that I like about these horses just out there just living wild. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11098.08s)]
*  Yes. [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11104.08s)]
*  And probably very happy. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11105.08s)]
*  Like that's the only way to be happy. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11107.08s)]
*  The way they want to live. [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11109.08s)]
*  Of course. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11110.08s)]
*  We are just so accustomed to all horses being just locked up. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11111.08s)]
*  Right. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11114.08s)]
*  Weird right? [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11115.08s)]
*  It is weird. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11116.08s)]
*  We think of wild horses as a problem. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11117.08s)]
*  Right. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11119.08s)]
*  That's a problem. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11120.08s)]
*  Interesting. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11121.08s)]
*  But wrangling them in. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11122.08s)]
*  They're wild. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11123.08s)]
*  Why are they out there? [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11124.08s)]
*  Why? [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11125.08s)]
*  When we can be riding them. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11126.08s)]
*  This is bullshit. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11127.08s)]
*  They're free. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11128.08s)]
*  Roaming where they want. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11129.08s)]
*  This is such an issue. [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11131.08s)]
*  And you can't control them like you control deer. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11132.08s)]
*  Right. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11135.08s)]
*  So if there's like wild deer and the population gets too high you just issue tags and then [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11136.08s)]
*  the hunters go and they you know manage the wildlife population that way. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11141.08s)]
*  You can't do that with horses because people don't like you want to shoot a fucking horse. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11146.08s)]
*  That's creepy. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11150.08s)]
*  That's a tough. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11151.08s)]
*  That's a tough. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11152.08s)]
*  Creepy. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11153.08s)]
*  I don't want that gig if you had to do it. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11154.08s)]
*  Imagine you're the guy who has to go out and kill the wild horses. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11155.08s)]
*  You'd feel like such a piece of shit. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11157.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11159.08s)]
*  Especially if someone saw you too by accident or something. [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11160.08s)]
*  They told me to do it. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11162.08s)]
*  You got a sniper rifle just taking out these majestic staggers and mares. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11164.08s)]
*  When that video comes out. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11168.08s)]
*  Enjoying themselves on these beautiful plains just eating grass. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11170.08s)]
*  Not fucking with anybody. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11173.08s)]
*  Riding around jumping. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11175.08s)]
*  And you got them at a distance. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11176.08s)]
*  Boom. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11178.08s)]
*  Right. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11179.08s)]
*  And the baby horse looking at the mom like oh my god what just happened. [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11180.08s)]
*  So if you have 82,000 and it doubles every four years and you got to get it down to 26,000. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11185.08s)]
*  Dude that's a lot of slaughter. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11191.08s)]
*  They're going to poison them or something. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11193.08s)]
*  Well. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11195.08s)]
*  They'll do something gnarly. [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11196.08s)]
*  I wonder what they're going to do because that has giant consequences. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11197.08s)]
*  Because then things that eat them get poisoned. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11200.08s)]
*  There was a problem with that in LA. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11202.08s)]
*  Because they were poisoning rats. [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11204.08s)]
*  And then you're seeing like a decrease in the owl population. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11205.08s)]
*  Ah. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11208.08s)]
*  Right. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11209.08s)]
*  Because the owls would swoop down and get these diseased rats. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11210.08s)]
*  These poisoned rats. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11212.08s)]
*  And then they would get sick. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11214.08s)]
*  We had before we moved here an owl died on our front porch. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11215.08s)]
*  And there was something wrong with it man. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11220.08s)]
*  We were wondering if it got poisoned. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11222.08s)]
*  It was all fucked up. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11224.08s)]
*  It was just like trying to like move but couldn't. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11225.08s)]
*  And we found like I guess it had fallen from the sky and just landed in front of our house. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11228.08s)]
*  There's a barn owl? [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11233.08s)]
*  A real fucking owl. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11234.08s)]
*  Like real like. [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11236.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11238.08s)]
*  One of them cat killing owls. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11239.08s)]
*  The ones that turn around and look at you. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11241.08s)]
*  It wasn't necessarily a big one. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11243.08s)]
*  It was just a regular size one. [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11244.08s)]
*  But it was weird man to see this thing poisoned I think. [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11246.08s)]
*  My guess is that it either ate something. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11250.08s)]
*  Like people all they do that all the time. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11253.08s)]
*  They leave out rat poison. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11255.08s)]
*  Right. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11256.08s)]
*  Like that's how people take care of rats around their house. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11257.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11259.08s)]
*  You don't realize. [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11260.08s)]
*  You're right. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11261.08s)]
*  Everything else is being poisoned. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11262.08s)]
*  Something eats it. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11263.08s)]
*  It's going to be poisoned. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11264.08s)]
*  Maybe it comes in contact with something else. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11265.08s)]
*  That's the beautiful thing about the ecosystem of California is that those little coyotes, [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11266.08s)]
*  they keep the rat population down. [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11271.08s)]
*  People that are sad because the coyotes kill their cats and kill their dogs. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11273.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11276.08s)]
*  It is sad. [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11277.08s)]
*  But also the reason why you're not infested with rats is because you've got little tiny [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11278.08s)]
*  wolves that are running through the hills every day just eating everything that slips [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11282.08s)]
*  up. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11285.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11286.08s)]
*  And you need that balance. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11287.08s)]
*  As weird as that seems. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11288.08s)]
*  No. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11289.08s)]
*  That's a well designed plan at the end of the day. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11290.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11293.08s)]
*  But there's something. [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11294.08s)]
*  There's something cool about seeing those motherfuckers operating in the city. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11295.08s)]
*  There's something cool about like a coyote. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11298.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11300.08s)]
*  Just hanging out in the city. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11301.08s)]
*  There's a creepy video of a coyote eating a cat in L.A. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11302.08s)]
*  on a front lawn while traffic is driving by and this coyote is just eating this cat. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11307.08s)]
*  I might have seen this. [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11312.08s)]
*  I remember seeing coyotes in downtown Chicago a couple years ago. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11313.08s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11317.08s)]
*  That blew me away. [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11318.08s)]
*  They're in every city. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11319.08s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11320.08s)]
*  Every city in the country. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11321.08s)]
*  But that's wild to think about. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11322.08s)]
*  It's wild. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11323.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11324.08s)]
*  And they haven't attacked people. [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11325.08s)]
*  Yeah, they have. [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdiIh2CL6g&t=11326.08s)]
