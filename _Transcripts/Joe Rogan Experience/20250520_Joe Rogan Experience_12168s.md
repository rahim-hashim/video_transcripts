# Joe Rogan Experience #2324 - Amanda Knox
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6.0s)]
*  Hey! Good to see you again. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10.0s)]
*  You have a book? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=15.0s)]
*  I do. Yeah, I hope you like it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=16.0s)]
*  Free. That's a great name. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=18.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's on point. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=20.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's on the nose. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=22.0s)]
*  Yes, well, that whole question of what does it mean to be free? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=24.0s)]
*  And what, you know, yes, there's the physical like, oh, you're out of prison. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=28.0s)]
*  But then also, is your life the thing that you expected it to be? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=32.0s)]
*  And how do you make your own freedom when you feel hemmed in by all of the things that happen to you? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=36.0s)]
*  So, yeah, you're connected to that forever. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=41.0s)]
*  That's always going to be a part of your life. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=45.0s)]
*  It's not like anything else that didn't really happen. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=47.0s)]
*  Like you didn't do anything and you're connected to something that you didn't really do forever. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=51.0s)]
*  For people that don't know the story. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we should do a little recap. Recap. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=58.0s)]
*  Okay, recap friends. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=60.0s)]
*  Real quick. Recap friends. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=62.0s)]
*  And you can go back to the episode of that of Joe Rogan. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=64.0s)]
*  What number was that? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=67.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=68.0s)]
*  Off the top of your head. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=69.0s)]
*  If you just Google Amanda Knox, you'll go, holy shit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=70.0s)]
*  They'll go down a crazy rabbit hole. Yes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=73.0s)]
*  So in a nutshell, what happened? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=75.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=77.0s)]
*  I was studying abroad when I was 20 years old in Perugia, Italy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=78.0s)]
*  One of my roommates was raped and murdered by a burglar who broke into our home. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=82.0s)]
*  But I was accused of having orchestrated a murder orgy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=87.0s)]
*  And I was sent to prison for four years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=92.0s)]
*  I was sentenced to 26 years. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=95.0s)]
*  I was put on trial for eight years. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=97.0s)]
*  And it became this international scandal where it sort of pinged all of the buttons in all the right places. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=99.0s)]
*  This happened in 2007. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=109.0s)]
*  So, you know, early 2000s when the internet was or the internet, the social media was really becoming a thing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=111.0s)]
*  The iPhone was becoming a thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=119.0s)]
*  I think that that played a huge role of people sort of going into their little echo chambers and fighting online. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=121.0s)]
*  And so I think that there was yeah, it was a case that for whatever reason rose above the the level of other cases. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=127.0s)]
*  Like ultimately, this case was actually very simple and it wouldn't have risen to the level of international infamy. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=138.0s)]
*  Were it not for the series of mistakes that the prosecution and the and the detectives made at the very beginning by trying to pin a man's crime on me, a woman. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=144.0s)]
*  Yeah. And if anybody wants, there's a documentary. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=155.0s)]
*  Yes, there's a Netflix documentary. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=158.0s)]
*  I wrote a book called Waiting to be Heard. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=160.0s)]
*  And then more recently, I wrote this book Free My Search for Meaning, which covers like, you know, you can read it and learn about the case. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=162.0s)]
*  But it's mostly about how do you come out of an experience like that and make sense of it? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=170.0s)]
*  And then part one of the big stories in it is how I then developed a relationship with my prosecutor, which I think you'll probably be in the camp of people of thinking that I'm utterly insane for having done that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=176.0s)]
*  Maybe, maybe, maybe you won't. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=189.0s)]
*  I just remember that when we talked about this back in the day, you were like this motherfucker. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you've become friends with them? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=197.0s)]
*  Friend is an interesting word. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=200.0s)]
*  What is a friend? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=204.0s)]
*  And someone else asked me that, like, I was like, it depends on what you mean by friend. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=205.0s)]
*  Because, and they said, well, do you trust him? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=211.0s)]
*  And I said, well, I, I think that at the point that we are now in our relationship, I do trust him. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=215.0s)]
*  I trust that he's telling me the truth about what he really thinks and feels about the situation. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=226.0s)]
*  So I feel like I have very privileged, special access to the mind of the person who put me in prison. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=233.0s)]
*  And that is a very interesting, awkward, but also empowering place for me to be. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=243.0s)]
*  Because one of the things that really bothered me about this experience was not understanding why it happened to me. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=252.0s)]
*  Why did this man look at a 20-year-old girl with no criminal history, no motivation to commit this crime? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=259.0s)]
*  Why did he look at me and think there's my rapist and murderer? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=265.0s)]
*  And I didn't understand it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=269.0s)]
*  And I didn't feel like demonizing him in my mind or vilifying him in my mind was going to actually give me a satisfying answer as to the why of it all. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=271.0s)]
*  A lot of people said, well, it's just because he's a bad dude. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=283.0s)]
*  He doesn't care what the truth is. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=285.0s)]
*  He's just covering his ass. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=287.0s)]
*  These were all really simplistic ways of framing his motivations, and I didn't really buy them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=289.0s)]
*  So instead, what I was interested in was going to the source and confronting him, asking why. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=297.0s)]
*  But to ask someone, why did you hurt me, which I think is a really common thing that people who have been hurt want to know. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=306.0s)]
*  They want an acknowledgment that they've been hurt and they want to understand why, and they want to know if that person's not going to hurt them anymore, not going to hurt other people. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=315.0s)]
*  That's really common for people who have been hurt. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=322.0s)]
*  The challenge is that people who hurt other people don't like to be confronted with that fact. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=326.0s)]
*  And so how do you start a conversation that's not going to immediately become adversarial? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=332.0s)]
*  And that was one of my biggest challenges. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=338.0s)]
*  I think that I came up with this methodology that actually became so important to me that I tattooed it on my arm. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=341.0s)]
*  So this is it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=349.0s)]
*  There are four steps. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=351.0s)]
*  And the first one is find common ground. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=353.0s)]
*  So it's this Venn diagram. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=356.0s)]
*  Find common ground. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=358.0s)]
*  I promise you that every single person on this earth, you have something in common with them. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=360.0s)]
*  Find it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=365.0s)]
*  So I asked myself, what could I and my prosecutor have in common? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=366.0s)]
*  I didn't know this man. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=370.0s)]
*  I didn't know what his history was, what his background was. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=371.0s)]
*  But I did know that he, like me, was part of this really big scandalous in the media case. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=374.0s)]
*  And he very likely felt misconstrued or misrepresented also in the process, maybe dehumanized in the process. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=381.0s)]
*  And so I reached out to him and I acknowledged that fact. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=392.0s)]
*  I said, hey, I don't know who you are. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=396.0s)]
*  I only ever encountered you in the police office and in the courtroom where you were someone who was trying to ruin my life. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=399.0s)]
*  So you were a big, scary boogie man. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=407.0s)]
*  And I saw you in the media and I've seen how the media represented you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=410.0s)]
*  But knowing from experience, I know how that can be very misrepresentative. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=416.0s)]
*  So I said to him, I want to know who you really are. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=420.0s)]
*  And I hope that you might be interested to know who I really am because I don't think you know who I really am. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=424.0s)]
*  I don't think that you would have prosecuted me if you knew who I really am. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=431.0s)]
*  And that was the beginning of the dialogue. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=435.0s)]
*  This like I went out of my way to acknowledge that he might have had noble motivations even if he was wrong. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=438.0s)]
*  And I think this is like a really important thing is I wanted to give him radical benefit of the doubt. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=447.0s)]
*  Maybe, just maybe, this like horrible thing that happened to me could have been the result of understandable mistakes. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=461.0s)]
*  And if anything, I think coming into contact with the Innocence Movement and criminal justice system stuff and reform, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=471.0s)]
*  all the stuff that I've learned after having gone through this experience has made me realize that like some of the most horrible things can happen [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=477.0s)]
*  and can be enacted by people who have the best of intentions. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=485.0s)]
*  And so I assumed that of him and I gave him that benefit of the doubt. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=489.0s)]
*  And as soon as I like opened that door, like, hey, you hurt me, but maybe that wasn't your intention. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=494.0s)]
*  Maybe your intention was something else. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=501.0s)]
*  He filled that void with his story and his message and what he wanted me to understand about himself. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=504.0s)]
*  And I mean, one of the wildest things about this book is that I talk about like I do not sugarcoat what I went through, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=512.0s)]
*  and especially what he did to me. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=521.0s)]
*  Like I very clearly set out like here's the fucked up shit he said about me in court, completely without evidence, like totally made up bullshit. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=523.0s)]
*  And it ruined my life. Right? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=532.0s)]
*  Here's what it is. Acknowledge these facts. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=535.0s)]
*  And also, and also here is a person who might have had like in doing so might have been coming from a place of trying to rationalize things in his own mind, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=539.0s)]
*  which is a thing that we all do. We all do on a regular basis. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=551.0s)]
*  We're all just sort of interpreting our reality in the way that suits us. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=555.0s)]
*  And so I and I wrote this book from my perspective. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=560.0s)]
*  I translated the entire thing into Italian before it ever got published so that I could share it with him so that he would know what I was saying about him in public, what was imminently going to come out. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=567.0s)]
*  And his response was. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=579.0s)]
*  I have never felt more seen. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=583.0s)]
*  That's what he told me. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=587.0s)]
*  It sounds like something a teenage girl would say. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=589.0s)]
*  Well, that's an interesting observation. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=591.0s)]
*  Because it's become quite emotional, especially on his part. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=597.0s)]
*  I shouldn't go there too much. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=611.0s)]
*  Just protecting his privacy. That's hilarious. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=616.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=619.0s)]

*  Well, I don't know. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=705.0s)]
*  I've just had really bad stuff happen to me. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=707.0s)]
*  And like, I don't wish bad stuff upon other people. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=709.0s)]
*  And it's a beautiful way to live your life. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=712.0s)]
*  It really is. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=714.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what all Christians aspire to. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=716.0s)]
*  Is what you're doing. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=720.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I'm not a radical forgiveness. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=723.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=727.0s)]
*  You know, it's funny. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=728.0s)]
*  I didn't really set out for people like point to that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=729.0s)]
*  They're like, forgiveness, forgiveness. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=731.0s)]
*  You're doing forgiveness. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=732.0s)]
*  And I was like, is this forgiveness or is this just communicating with him as forgiveness in some way and not having extreme anger? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=733.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=742.0s)]
*  I do have extreme anger. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=743.0s)]
*  Like, that's all part of it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=745.0s)]
*  And this is where like the Buddhist in me comes out, where you you can have extreme anger towards a person and at the same time hold them in your hand as this like tender, fallible creature that is capable of violence against you, but is also capable of being hurt. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=747.0s)]
*  Just because someone hurt you doesn't mean that they're not capable of being hurt. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=772.0s)]
*  And I certainly don't want to be in the position of hurting someone like that's just who I am. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=776.0s)]
*  And if anything, like one thing that I've communicated to him is like, look, I don't know if you're ever going to really wrap your head around what you did to me. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=783.0s)]
*  But if you do one day. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=794.0s)]
*  I know that you're going to feel really, really bad. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=800.0s)]
*  And I just want you to know that I. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=804.0s)]
*  I don't wish suffering on you. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=809.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=812.0s)]
*  Did you ask him if he had gone over any of his previous cases and wondered whether he did the same thing to other people? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=814.0s)]
*  Because I don't think that's something you do once. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=822.0s)]
*  I don't think you are an ethical prosecutor who just really objectively analyzes the evidence and puts forth a case based on what you think is the facts. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=825.0s)]
*  I don't I don't think you do that your whole career. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=839.0s)]
*  And then this 20 year old bitch, I think she's too cute. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=842.0s)]
*  I don't like how she's smiling. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=846.0s)]
*  Yeah, there. Yeah, there was that element to it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=848.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think that and I do feel like there was some kind of pornographic nature to it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=851.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=861.0s)]
*  Like, I think that well, there's a lot of men that have like a deep resentment for beautiful women. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=862.0s)]
*  From feelings of rejection or yeah. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=868.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=871.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because they are attracted to them or they find them to be beautiful or desirable and they know that that woman wants to have nothing to do with them. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=872.0s)]
*  They are completely repulsive. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=883.0s)]
*  And so you see it a lot with unfortunately unattractive men. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=885.0s)]
*  They develop a hate for women. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=889.0s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=892.0s)]
*  I've seen it evolve over years with people that I used to be friends with, you know, just constant rejection. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=893.0s)]
*  And then it becomes like, fuck these women and fuck them. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=899.0s)]
*  They just want this like, OK, put yourself in their position. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=902.0s)]
*  You're gross. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=907.0s)]
*  Like what are they supposed to do? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=910.0s)]
*  Try harder. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=912.0s)]
*  What are they supposed to do? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=913.0s)]
*  Like be with someone that they're not attracted to to make that person feel better. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=914.0s)]
*  Like, that's not what people do. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=919.0s)]
*  Like you have a short window of life. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=920.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're supposed to pursue what you like. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=922.0s)]
*  And you're you know, your fucking hand to card sucks. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=924.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=927.0s)]
*  You know, this is how it goes. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=928.0s)]
*  But that thing where, you know, they look at you like you have it too easy. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=930.0s)]
*  You have too many gifts. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=937.0s)]
*  There's life has given you too good a hand of cards, you know, and you should be punished. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=939.0s)]
*  You should be knocked down a peg. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=946.0s)]
*  You see that in particular in the media with celebrity. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=948.0s)]
*  It's a big one with celebrity women. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=952.0s)]
*  If something goes wrong, like they just can't wait. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=954.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=957.0s)]
*  To dunk on them, mock them for weight gain, whatever it is. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=958.0s)]
*  For getting out of a car in the wrong way. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=962.0s)]
*  They were the ones who were like showing up to get up their skirt. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=965.0s)]
*  Yeah. Any sort of stuff was on purpose. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=968.0s)]
*  Oh, is it? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=971.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=972.0s)]
*  I think the Paris Hilton stuff like back in the day where a lot of women were like, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=973.0s)]
*  it was like an epidemic of getting out of cars. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=976.0s)]
*  Photographers just happened to be on the ground. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=980.0s)]
*  Like you're a woman. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=984.0s)]
*  You've worn skirts. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=985.0s)]
*  It's not easy to look up someone's skirt. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=986.0s)]
*  If you're standing up and someone gets out there, how the fuck do you get down? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=988.0s)]
*  You'd have to be on your knees. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=992.0s)]
*  I think they were doing it on purpose. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=994.0s)]
*  I think it was a way of going viral before viral was a thing because it went away. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=996.0s)]
*  Like when was the last time that we had an up the skirt shot? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1001.0s)]
*  Why don't you have any underwear on? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1005.0s)]
*  That seems weird. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1007.0s)]
*  Well, panty lines, you know, that's a real thing. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1008.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1011.0s)]
*  But that's what G-strings were invented for, right? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1012.0s)]
*  Those still create lines, my friend. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1014.0s)]
*  I guess. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1016.0s)]
*  Are you that concerned with lines that you want to go bareback? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1017.0s)]
*  I've not gone bareback at a premiere, I have to say. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1021.0s)]
*  With a little skirt on, hopping out of a car, and the way they did it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1024.0s)]
*  It's just I think it was like, you know, the same people that had sex tapes that leaked air quotes. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1029.0s)]
*  That were engineered. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1037.0s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing was, it was on purpose. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1039.0s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1042.0s)]
*  But in terms of trying to take beautiful women down a peg, I think you're right. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1044.0s)]
*  I also think that something that was going on in my case that I think you also tend to see in those situations [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1049.0s)]
*  where you're trying to take beautiful women down a peg is this idea of like pitting women against each other. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1056.0s)]
*  That was a huge thing in my case where they were suggesting that here I was, this free-spirited, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1063.0s)]
*  but also hoary American girl versus the uptight, judgmental British girl. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1070.0s)]
*  And therefore they hated each other with a vengeance, with a lethal vengeance. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1079.0s)]
*  And then this idea of like a murder orgy appeared where this pornographic fantasy of women [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1087.0s)]
*  expressing their own violent fantasies towards each other in real life [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1097.0s)]
*  and using men as pawns in that game of violent hatred towards each other. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1105.0s)]
*  I think you see that a lot even in a person I write about in this book [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1113.0s)]
*  who's become a dear friend of mine is Monica Lewinsky. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1120.0s)]
*  And how I feel like people really wanted to bring her down a peg in part because they wanted to bring Hillary down a peg. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1124.0s)]
*  And the whole like, the person who actually committed the affair was sort of, I mean, he definitely got his part, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1133.0s)]
*  but it was all like a political game of they're trying to take down the man, but they're also taking down the woman, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1140.0s)]
*  and they're especially railroading this young woman who made a mistake. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1144.0s)]
*  And it became known as the Monica Lewinsky scandal and not the Bill Clinton affair or whatever. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1148.0s)]
*  Like it matters what you name a thing. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1155.0s)]
*  And it seemed like the legacy of that and the person who became defined entirely by that scandal [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1157.0s)]
*  happened to be Monica, the one who was the person with the least amount of power and agency in that equation. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1164.0s)]
*  Also 20 years old. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1172.0s)]
*  Yeah, 23 years old. Yeah. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1174.0s)]
*  Who did a very normal thing, which was fall in love with a charismatic, powerful man. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1176.0s)]
*  And he was handsome as fuck back then. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1181.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1182.0s)]
*  I mean, he was the president of the United States. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1183.0s)]
*  He was the president of the United States. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1184.0s)]
*  He was charismatic. He was handsome. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1186.0s)]
*  And it powered her with attention. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1188.0s)]
*  And it makes sense that a young, inexperienced person would fall in love with him. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1189.0s)]
*  And yet she was the one who got railroaded. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1194.0s)]
*  She was the home wrecker. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1196.0s)]
*  She was the one who became the subject of all the rap lyrics. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1197.0s)]
*  And her entire life and her entire identity became identified with this mistake she had made. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1201.0s)]
*  And that was not the same thing with the president of the United States. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1208.0s)]
*  And I think that that impulse to define women by their worst moments and to tear them down for their worst moments is prevalent from what I have seen. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1212.0s)]
*  Well, I think because they know it's so devastating to the person. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1227.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1230.0s)]
*  It's like there's that the bully instinct when they know that you're weak and vulnerable, you know, to attack. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1232.0s)]
*  But why? To what end? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1238.0s)]
*  People are cruel because they've been hurt. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1240.0s)]
*  You know, it's the hurt people hurt people thing. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1242.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's like schadenfreude just as an audience. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1244.0s)]
*  We want a story. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1248.0s)]
*  We want a real life story where we get to passively enjoy the destruction of another human being. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1250.0s)]
*  Right. And also you don't know her. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1256.0s)]
*  So you're disassociated. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1258.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1260.0s)]
*  Like if she was your friend and you did that, you'd have to be a special kind of monster like that woman, Linda Tripp, who did it all. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1261.0s)]
*  That's a special kind of monster. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1267.0s)]
*  Right. Special kind of monster who trots that out to the whole world to try to take down Bill Clinton. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1269.0s)]
*  Yeah. Which didn't even work. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1275.0s)]
*  No. And that's what's fascinating. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1277.0s)]
*  It worked to destroy Monica. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1279.0s)]
*  But also, like you when you look at Bill Bill Clinton, this handsome president, and then you look at Linda Tripp, who is very unattractive. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1281.0s)]
*  That's also plays in like I want to take him down, too. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1290.0s)]
*  And probably I want to take her down as well. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1294.0s)]
*  Like there's a lot of like fuck everybody else. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1297.0s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1300.0s)]
*  You know, when you're you know, you're unseen to use the same vernacular, you know, and then you see like other people getting attention. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1301.0s)]
*  And it's just like the fact that she did it and she knew her and she but also this is like this is the game of cards that they're playing. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1310.0s)]
*  This is House of Cards. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1319.0s)]
*  This is you know, this is literally what they do any time they have a chance in the right. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1320.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1325.0s)]
*  Any window, any vulnerability. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1326.0s)]
*  It's the dirtiest game in the world. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1328.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a disgusting game, you know, and if you get sucked into it, you'll find that out. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1331.0s)]
*  You know, I don't want anything to do with it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1336.0s)]
*  It's the most evil. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1338.0s)]
*  It's really is like when I see people that are running for president, I'm like, what are you doing? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1340.0s)]
*  I know. Why would you do that yourself? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1345.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then you have to spend the rest of your life like with, you know, Secret Service following you around. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1347.0s)]
*  You know, you can't exist in the world as a normal human being like that. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1353.0s)]
*  I do feel like there is you have to be a special kind of person in order to be attracted to something like that. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1357.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1365.0s)]
*  And ironically, that's the kind of person is attracted to that in general is not the kind of person you want in a leadership position. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1366.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1375.0s)]
*  You know, which is like, wow, what do we do that? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1376.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. So is democracy completely and utterly flawed because it relies upon the ambition of the wrong people or heroes or legitimate heroes like someone who's like, you know, I'm going to tolerate this. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1378.0s)]
*  I'm going to carry the burden of this on my back because I think I can help people. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1393.0s)]
*  But does anyone ever like actually arrive at the like at the seat of the president as that person? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1397.0s)]
*  Like, here's the question. Do they stay that person? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1406.0s)]
*  Because I think Obama was that person. I really did. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1409.0s)]
*  You know, it was like, wow, we've got a good one. You know, yeah, I was sad. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1412.0s)]
*  I missed out on that. Yeah, it was pretty cool. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1416.0s)]
*  But in retrospect, you know, when looking back, like, probably not really like probably got corrupted by the system or was corrupt originally, you know, is now willing to openly lie. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1419.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's dark. It's dark. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1435.0s)]
*  You know, and I think it's just a it's it's a strange social position that I don't think is manageable for anyone. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1439.0s)]
*  I don't think the human mind is prepared to be in that kind of a position of power and not have it completely distort what you are. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1452.0s)]
*  And then there's the relationships that you have to have with all these various politicians and then special interest groups and lobbyists and then foreign leaders. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1463.0s)]
*  And then how do you manage all of that? Heads of defense contracting companies like what? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1472.0s)]
*  Yeah. Can I tell you a story? Yes, please. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1480.0s)]
*  OK, so this story didn't actually make it in my book, but it is one that I wanted to tell you because it talks about how my weird relationship with other people who are in positions of power like police officers. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1486.0s)]
*  Right. Like, you know, I'm a I'm an advocate of criminal justice reform. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1503.0s)]
*  I talk a lot about like I go and testify in front of my, you know, state Congress trying to get certain laws passed to protect, you know, innocent people. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1507.0s)]
*  And one thing that I like to point out is that I'm not anti law enforcement. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1516.0s)]
*  If anything, I was a victim of crime before I became a victim of the criminal justice system. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1523.0s)]
*  Like someone broke into my home and raped and murdered my roommate. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1530.0s)]
*  And then I called the cops and then the cops went on to betray me. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1534.0s)]
*  And but that doesn't mean that there isn't like I'm not one of those, you know, fuck all the police. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1539.0s)]
*  We don't need them, you know, abolish the whole system. That's not what I believe. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1546.0s)]
*  But as someone who has had this complicated experience with police, I don't really know what to do when something bad goes down. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1552.0s)]
*  And I want to tell you a story about something bad that went down. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1564.0s)]
*  It was in L.A. I was staying at a friend's house with my husband and our two kids. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1569.0s)]
*  We were doing work down there and our friends were not there. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1574.0s)]
*  But in the middle of the night, we hear someone yelling out in the, you know, out in the street. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1578.0s)]
*  We think there's some drunk guy out there, but it gets closer and closer and closer until finally there is a huge bang. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1585.0s)]
*  And my husband gets up in his tighty whities and says one thing to me. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1594.0s)]
*  Call the police before he marches downstairs. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1602.0s)]
*  We were upstairs in the second story and we hear a bang. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1606.0s)]
*  We hear yelling. He goes down there in his underwear. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1609.0s)]
*  And I don't know if the last thing I'm ever going to hear from my husband at that point is call the police, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1613.0s)]
*  which is an interesting final words to get from the love of your life when you're me. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1619.0s)]
*  And my my, you know, infant son is crying. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1625.0s)]
*  My two year old daughter at the time is going, what's going on? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1628.0s)]
*  And I'm trying to calm him while reassure her while looking around the room thinking, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1633.0s)]
*  how do I barricade a door and can I jump out of a window with two small children? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1640.0s)]
*  All of that before I think dial 911, because the last time that I dialed the equivalent of 911 to call for help, I got thrown into prison. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1648.0s)]
*  I realize that there's nothing I can do to protect my kids. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1662.0s)]
*  So I call 911 and eventually, you know, my husband is able to get this intruder to leave the house. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1664.0s)]
*  The police arrive and I have a very strange encounter with them because they are very nice to me. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1673.0s)]
*  And I was not expecting that. And they are very nice to my daughter. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1683.0s)]
*  And they give her a nice little, you know, police badge. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1687.0s)]
*  And I'm sitting here thinking, great, now I'm going to have to throw a police themed birthday party for her because now she's going to be super into police. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1690.0s)]
*  And I'm just like, what is happening to my life? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1696.0s)]
*  And I'm scared that they're going to recognize me and I'm scared that they're going to think maybe she faked a break in. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1698.0s)]
*  Like, all of that is going on in my head. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1703.0s)]
*  And I don't know how to resolve that. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1706.0s)]
*  I have, you know, broken to my home once, murdered my roommate, broken to the place I was staying again, thankfully didn't murder anybody. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1710.0s)]
*  But like, how do I make sense of my relationship with people who are empowered to protect me but also are empowered to hurt me? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1722.0s)]
*  What do I do about that? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1734.0s)]
*  You tell me, Joe. What do I do? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1736.0s)]
*  There's no way I could know what's going through your mind. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1739.0s)]
*  You know, the experience that you had is that no one can even pretend to have those thoughts in their head because this is not just paranoid fantasy. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1744.0s)]
*  This is your actual lived experience for years. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1759.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1763.0s)]
*  What had happened? Like the bang? Was someone kicking down the door? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1766.0s)]
*  Yeah, he had kicked in the door through the deadbolt. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1770.0s)]
*  What was the yelling? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1773.0s)]
*  The yelling was he was just... [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1775.0s)]
*  Schizophrenic? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1777.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1778.0s)]
*  He thought that someone had stole that house from him and he was yelling for some name. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1779.0s)]
*  Clearly was just like either confused or mentally ill in some capacity. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1785.0s)]
*  But and thankfully not armed. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1791.0s)]
*  But like my husband didn't know when he walked down the stairs in his underwear without any... [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1795.0s)]
*  Like he grabbed a broom on his way down and that was between putting himself and a broom between whoever this person was and what he was doing. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1800.0s)]
*  Putting himself and a broom between whoever this person was who had just kicked in the front door through the deadbolt and his family. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1811.0s)]
*  And that might have been the last time I ever saw him. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1821.0s)]
*  And I did not know what to do. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1825.0s)]
*  I try to like joke about it now where I actually did a stand up bit about it a while back about how I was like testing my butt to see if it was bouncy enough to like jump out of the window and bounce. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1828.0s)]
*  But like when I think back on it it's just it's still scary. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1840.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1844.0s)]
*  And I don't like how I feel right now that when I'm scared I'm supposed to call the police but I'm also scared to call the police. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1847.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1860.0s)]
*  And so you know when I go and do advocacy work for you know I'm now on the board of an organization called the Innocence Center. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1862.0s)]
*  Innocencecenter.org which by the way just got a bunch of federal funding taken away thanks Elon. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1873.0s)]
*  You'd think that they would be interested in supporting organizations that clean up the messes of the criminal justice system but apparently not. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1880.0s)]
*  They want to support us. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1891.0s)]
*  Innocencecenter.org. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1892.0s)]
*  What happened that they got their funding taken away? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1894.0s)]
*  What was the circumstances like? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1897.0s)]
*  I mean there's a federal funding that is designed for innocence organizations and I think what I heard is that there are certain words that sort of became taboo within the administration. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1900.0s)]
*  That if you were using these words or these terminologies that they associate with like DEI that then that sort of puts you on the list of being cut for federal funding. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1916.0s)]
*  And one of those words was like the word fair. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1928.0s)]
*  And in an organization that is interested in justice and for getting innocent people out of prison the word fair is going to come up quite a bit. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1931.0s)]
*  So is this just an algorithm? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1941.0s)]
*  Is this just scanning the mission statement of whatever these organizations are? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1943.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean I think that that's a first step is they'll just use this they're going to use algorithms and AI to help them identify potential things to cut. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1948.0s)]
*  And I think as a new innocence organization we were considered not worthy of the federal funding that we have relied on and to help innocent people. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1959.0s)]
*  Are you one of the founders of this organization? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1971.0s)]
*  Me? No I'm on the board. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1973.0s)]
*  But yes this is formally the California Innocence Project that has since sort of turned into the Innocence Center. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1975.0s)]
*  But you'll see you're seeing this all across the board of innocence projects of getting their federal funding taken away. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1982.0s)]
*  And there's no accusations of impropriety or misuse of funds or high salaries for certain individuals or nothing? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1988.0s)]
*  Nope. Just it's deprioritized because I think we're considered leftist organizations potentially. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=1998.0s)]
*  I don't know. But I know that like I have always thought that innocence and getting and justice were bipartisan issues. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2007.0s)]
*  And I thought that we had been making great strides in sort of welcoming in both liberal and conservative partners in this ongoing fight. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2018.0s)]
*  But because these sort of these things disproportionately impact people of color you're going to see language around that that acknowledges that fact. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2029.0s)]
*  And I think that that has been sort of put in where innocence organizations are now being put into DEI camps and we're being stripped of funding. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2039.0s)]
*  And I think that's I hope that that's an oversight issue and that they're going to recognize the mistake that they're making. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2049.0s)]
*  But as it stands right now, innocence organizations, not just the one that I'm associated with, are scrambling to get the funding that they were promised to continue doing, you know, doing the things that cost money like filing, you know, filing all of their work and going through all of the casework and doing the DNA tests and doing investigations to see if you can reach the witnesses that maybe have changed their stories in all these years. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2059.0s)]
*  It takes a lot of money and resources to prove a person's innocence. You have to reinvestigate a case and we don't we don't have the funding that we we used to. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2084.0s)]

*  I do a lot of work with Josh Dubin. You know Josh? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2177.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I've never met him personally. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2181.0s)]
*  He was with the Innocence Project and now he's with the Ike Perlmutter Center for Legal Justice. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2183.0s)]
*  And same kind of work. Ironically, Ike Perlmutter is very close friends with Trump. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2191.0s)]
*  I mean, I would have thought that that would have been of interest to Trump considering his... [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2196.0s)]
*  I think it's a baby with the bath water type deal. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2202.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2205.0s)]
*  Where there's a lot of what you would call almost like slush fund NGOs where they're inappropriately moving funds around and doing stuff. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2206.0s)]
*  And I don't know if you've ever seen any of Mike Benz's work, but he essentially says that USAID is really there to do things that are too dirty for the CIA. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2216.0s)]
*  So the extraordinary amount of money that was being moved around, there's a certain percentage of it that was inappropriately being used. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2226.0s)]
*  I imagine so. Yeah. Sure. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2236.0s)]
*  An enormous percentage. It's a lot of money. But unfortunately, there's a lot of good that also is coming out of that money. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2238.0s)]
*  And that's what's difficult. It's like, you know, when you round up all the quote unquote gang members, right? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2246.0s)]
*  And you fly them to El Salvador. Are you sure they're all gang members? Or do you care? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2256.0s)]
*  Right. Exactly. I think that's... [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2262.0s)]
*  Or is it just like, we're just here to clean things up and if we break a few eggs to make an omelet. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2264.0s)]
*  Right. Are innocent people the price of us getting to be efficient? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2269.0s)]
*  Don't become a monster when you're fighting monsters. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2275.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's what I think we're brushing up against right now. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2278.0s)]
*  And as someone who really is like just interested in keeping, especially this issue, like this is a human, like we all should be on the same side about this. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2284.0s)]
*  100%. Yeah. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2295.0s)]
*  Why, like, why is it being turned into this a left or right issue? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2297.0s)]
*  Well, maybe I can get this in front of Josh and he can present it to some people and, you know, have them reconsider their position. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2302.0s)]
*  That would be great. I would, you know, and if you need to put me in contact, like I would be happy to... [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2311.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things through working with Josh and, you know, just through this podcast, we've gotten a lot of people released that were wrongfully convicted. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2317.0s)]
*  And, you know, when you go over the amount of corruption that's involved and I think there's an issue with human beings whenever there's a binary position, a one or a zero. You win or you lose. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2327.0s)]
*  Yes, the adversarial system. It's like I have to be, I have to win this side and I cannot at all, like, acknowledge some truth that might be to the other side. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2345.0s)]
*  And then you have this game where you hire, like if you are a guilty person, you hire the best defense attorneys that probably even know you're guilty. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2355.0s)]
*  But their job is to get you off by any means necessary to... [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2366.0s)]
*  Well, their job is to make the government prove your guilt, right? That's what a technically a defense attorney who's really good... [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2370.0s)]
*  Well, but that's not really what they're doing. They're trying to get you out of jail. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2377.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah. The goal being if you can't actually prove it, then... [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2380.0s)]
*  Well, their goal is to win as often as possible so that they're the person. Like this is the guy you want. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2384.0s)]
*  Although I have talked to some really interesting defense attorneys. The defense attorneys who represented Larry Nassar, for example, famously for those who don't remember was molesting young gymnasts. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2391.0s)]
*  You remember him? Yeah, the Olympics guy. Yeah, yeah. And I interviewed them because it was two women who represented him. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2407.0s)]
*  And so a lot of people were like, how dare you represent this man as a woman? How could you? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2415.0s)]
*  And their position was, well, we didn't represent him to prove him innocent. We had him plead guilty to these crimes. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2420.0s)]
*  We just feel that everyone deserves to have a defender. We're defenders. We represent people in the law. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2428.0s)]
*  And they were getting demonized for even taking him on as a client. And I thought that was interesting because they weren't trying to get him off. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2438.0s)]
*  They were just trying to represent due process. And I felt like that was a really interesting case of people confusing what is the role of a defense attorney. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2446.0s)]
*  And I think you're right. Like some defense attorneys really don't care if their clients are guilty or innocent because they are also in this adversarial system. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2462.0s)]
*  And so they are also in this position of just wanting to win and wanting to make the lives of law enforcement difficult. And they're willing to throw victims under the bus in the process. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2470.0s)]
*  Like I've had really frank conversations with friends of mine in the innocence world where they talk about how they were trained to just destroy a victim in order to diminish their credibility in court and to really put them in a really bad position. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2480.0s)]
*  And they didn't want to pursue justice for themselves. And I think that they look back and go, oh my God, I can't believe that that's how I was trained to be a defense attorney. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2501.0s)]
*  But that was just part of the game. And I think that's where this whole course of justice gets completely distorted. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2510.0s)]
*  Because it's like, well, what is the point of all of this? It should be about arriving at the truth and then having there be some recognized consequences for acknowledging what really happened. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2517.0s)]
*  Like we need to address the issue, which is somebody got hurt by someone else. What do we do? Now what? And instead it's become, well, I'm going to win it. Like I'm on this team. You're on this team. Fight, fight, fight. Let's see who wins. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2530.0s)]
*  And as a result, the whole issue of truth gets distorted and becomes about making the best story that captures the people's attention. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2545.0s)]
*  And I think that was a huge lesson for me was realizing that like the truth didn't matter. Like nobody cared about the truth. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2555.0s)]
*  They cared about the story. And was it a story that spoke to them? And was it a story that lingered for them? And that's, you know, an ongoing thing that I write about is like, okay, here's this crazy story that is not true, that took over my life. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2565.0s)]
*  And that still has this huge role. Like I'm still in conversation with that crazy story that was written about me. And the fact that like my entire identity is now wrapped up in the death of my friend that I had nothing to do with. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2581.0s)]
*  And I'll forever be defined by it because it's such a captivating story. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2598.0s)]
*  And because the prosecutor was dead set on winning and wasn't necessarily interested in the truth. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2603.0s)]
*  What he says, and it's very, again, it goes back to like, what are we telling ourselves? And what is the cognitive bias? And I think this is where it gets super interesting because winning is interpreted in some people's minds as doing their duty. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2613.0s)]
*  Right? Like the way that my prosecutor has always talked about it with me is that he maintains that he was doing his duty. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2634.0s)]
*  This was his job. His job was to make a case that made logical sense to him based upon certain premises. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2646.0s)]
*  And then to win that case in court. That was his job. That was his duty. And he believes that he was doing the right thing because that's what he was trained and incentivized to do. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2659.0s)]
*  In the same way that like, you know, journalists, if you ask journalists back who covered the case back in the day, they'll be like, well, we were doing our job. Our job was to sell the best story that we could to our audience. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2672.0s)]
*  And right. And so that's when it gets like fucked up because like how have our institutions that we've relied on to be truth seeking institutions been corrupted from the inside by ultimately what is a question of like money or power? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2685.0s)]
*  When politics gets brought into the equation with criminal justice, suddenly, you know, your prosecutor is now wanting to win cases not because they're the right cases to win, but because they want to be elected. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2703.0s)]
*  Like all of that gets distorted and the motivations behind all our institutions become warped. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2716.0s)]
*  But with the media, it's even more disgusting because it's not about politics. It's literally just about getting people to pay attention to their story. Right. And buy newspapers or click on links. Right. That's it. Right. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2724.0s)]
*  And then they hold then they hold their audience accountable for the kinds of stories that they are then incentivized to write. They say, well, you know, I wouldn't been writing this story if you weren't clicking on it. And it's like this vicious cycle. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2737.0s)]
*  That's crazy. That's like I wouldn't have robbed your house if you didn't have nice stuff. Exactly. Exactly. That's fucking crazy. But like that's how if you're in that little echo chamber of a system and that's what your reward structure is. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2751.0s)]
*  Of course, that's what you're going to end up delivering. If you're somebody who's not who doesn't have the introspection to question like, okay, wait, what am I doing? And what is the point of all of this? And do you have certain principles? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2762.0s)]
*  But again, the people who rise to the top are maybe the ones who are willing to question those principles in order to achieve certain ends. Yes. Yeah. And then there's also the problem with you're working for a corporation. If you're in the news, if you're not an independent journalist who has like rock solid personal ethics, you're working for a corporation. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2773.0s)]
*  And your job is to make money for your shareholders. Ultimately, and the way you do that is to get as many people to click on those links as possible. And maybe the person who's on the ground has a certain vision for what they want their like on the ground reporting to do. But then once it gets in the hands of editors and other editors, like it becomes completely warped from the thing that they were originally reporting on because the person who's over here is so divorced from the actual on the ground story and they know instead the story that's going to sell. Yeah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2791.0s)]
*  So yeah, it's dark. I mean, it's the same sort of distortion. Excuse me. Salute. Sorry. It's the same sort of distortion. When you were talking about prosecutors just trying to win. It's this thing where and ultimately, it's a severe distortion of what the best case scenario is. The best case scenario is [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2821.0s)]
*  prosecutors don't care about winning. They care about finding truly guilty people. And in cases where someone, whether they withhold evidence that could have exonerated an innocent person, or whether they distort things or twist things around in order to win, they should be forever removed from that system. You should never be allowed to do that. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2850.0s)]
*  But this is Kamala Harris did that and rose to be vice president and almost became president. And she is absolutely guilty of doing that. Yeah, I know. She tried to withhold, withhold DNA evidence that would have exonerated someone. I know. She was not a popular choice among the innocence community. I'll tell you that. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2877.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No, Josh Dubin broke her down on my show. But when she was running for president. Oh, were they here together? No. Okay. No, no, no. He broke down what she was guilty of when she was a prosecutor in California. Yeah, no, it wasn't. And that's why I was so mad that our party never actually gave us a choice. Right. There was no primary. No, there was no primary. They were just like, here's the person now. And if you don't vote for her, you're a bad person. Exactly. You're a fascist. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, it was that that. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2898.0s)]
*  This whole again, that's also just trying to win. Yeah, it's the same kind of thing. It's just the focus is on winning. Yeah. At what cost? I mean, and then that's a very slippery slope. Because if you're willing to accept that, guess what? Guess what? That that slope keeps slipping. And then next thing you know, you don't have breaks. You have to put a fucking blinder on because you're you're part of the problem. You're part of what's destroying society. So then you have to like reshape your own personal narrative and light. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2928.0s)]
*  Yourself about what you're doing and why you're doing it. Right. A little bit of like self brainwashing. And that fascinates me. Like in conversations with my prosecutor, how how has he convinced himself that he's the good guy? And and how has that changed when I have approached him? Not as an adversary, but as someone who is [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2957.92s)]
*  I wouldn't say like, tolerant, because I've never put myself in a position of sort of saying, oh, what you did was not a big deal. Like when I approached him, I was like, what you did was a big deal. And you were wrong and you hurt people. But like, acknowledging his humanity and the complexity of him and acknowledging that, like, he's not an evil person. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=2985.16s)]
*  Well, what is evil? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3011.3199999999997s)]
*  Intentional intentional malice, maybe. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3013.12s)]
*  That seems like he was doing it intentionally. If he was paying attention to the facts of the case. I mean, there was DNA evidence. There was all sorts of stuff that pointed to you not being the guilty party. And they ignored that. If that's not evil. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3015.52s)]
*  I mean, what he did, it's interesting. He wrote a whole book about the case. And he talked about how when he first arrived at at the scene, he immediately knew that it was a conspiracy, because he looked at the broken window, how the person had actually broken into our home and said, there's no way, zero chance that a burglar would have broken in to a house this way. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3030.56s)]
*  He just was like 100% convinced that immediately that the break in was staged. And if you take that, if you and your brain truly believe that, then what logically follows is a lot of what he then came up with. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3058.76s)]
*  Well, someone in the house is trying to cover up for a crime that they were involved in. Who lives in that house? Well, there are three other girls, one of whom was in Rome, one of whom is another Italian girl who was with her boyfriend and friends, and one of whom is the American girl who was with her boyfriend that night, but who also happened to be the one who called the police and brought attention to the house. So maybe because we found her at the scene of the crime, like, all of it sort of starts to like, make logical sense. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3078.2s)]
*  If you begin with a false premise, how did he reconcile that in the book? In his book? Yeah. I mean, he makes logical leaps. So he goes, Okay, well, then we discovered that, you know, all of this DNA of the person who actually committed the crime, right? Like, you know, they finally get the DNA back. And it's all pointing to this guy who has a history of breaking and entering and aggression towards women. And he doesn't go, Oh, no, we made a mistake. He goes, Oh, how can now he be involved in this thing that I, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3107.36s)]
*  know Amanda's involved in because I know the break in was staged. And, you know, like, so these, the this is how a person with good with genuinely good intentions can, can have false beliefs that then logic from which one can logically derive [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3137.44s)]
*  an insane story that requires like him to now believe like one of the things that I pointed out to him that just like drives me nuts that he continues to like, somehow hang on to is this idea that I was in a threesome with like I was in a three way relationship with my actual boyfriend, Rafael, and this burglar Rudy Gide. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3156.12s)]
*  And I was like, where are you coming up with that? And he was like, well, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3177.4s)]
*  whenever I interviewed Rudy, like he talks about interviewing, you know, interrogating Rudy, Rudy always seemed to have affectionate things to say about he always seemed to like, be interested in you. And from that, I can logically deduce that you guys had a relationship. And I was like, we, we, like, I didn't even know his name, there's no record of us ever communicating with each other. No one ever like saw us hanging out with each other. Like, what are you talking about? And he's like, Well, if you're interested in me, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3181.28s)]
*  he was involved in the crime, and you're involved in the crime, and he's sort of talking about, you know, you in an affectionate way, then logically, it makes sense that you were in this, you know, three way relationship with Rafael and Rudy. And I'm like, that's not true. And he's like, well, that's what it's that's what made logical sense to me at the time. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3211.28s)]
*  I think the issue is an egotistic idiot that has power. That's really what I think it is. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3230.32s)]
*  Because I think someone who has a belief and a confidence in their own abilities as a logical thinker, and I think anyone who is in that kind of position has to believe in themselves in that kind of way. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3238.88s)]
*  But not just that, like you have too much power. Like there's not enough oversight, you have too much power. And then you say something. And if your initial assertion is incorrect, you then have to defend it. So then you do mental gymnastics to try to defend it. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3253.48s)]
*  Right at the expense of your fucking life. Yes, he was willing to put you away forever. Like he had to know at some point in time in the back of his stupid brain, he had to know that you were innocent. And he was willing to push forward and concoct some sort of a three way relationship narrative that he still sticks to fuck that guy. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3267.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, and sometimes that's what my brain says, you know, sometimes [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3289.4599999999996s)]
*  your brain should say that, you know, I mean, forgiveness is really important, but some people just can't forgive. Like some people it's like, no, you need to come to grips with the fact that you're a piece of shit. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3293.3399999999997s)]
*  That's what's wrong here. It's not me forgiving you and you having this hall pass to just to be a piece of shit because you had this theory that you're still accusing me of. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3305.7799999999997s)]
*  No, that's that's not you're bad at what you do. And sometimes people are bad at what they do. Sometimes you get bad teachers, you get bad cops. Sometimes you get a bad electrician, your house catches fire. Some people some people suck at what they do. And to like have this like eternal forgiveness. Like sometimes it's not smart to do that. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3317.5400000000004s)]
*  Well, certainly. And I and I think that's really working as a prosecutor. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3339.42s)]
*  No, no, he's retired. He has retired. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3342.5400000000004s)]
*  He should be in jail. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3344.86s)]
*  Like literally, I do not wish jail upon him. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3347.2200000000003s)]
*  That's sweet. But that's crime. Like what he did was not just a crime, but it was a conspiracy. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3350.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I, I would have to say that I agree that there's I always wanted to I always wondered where the adults were in the room. Like, you know, the whole first two years of my imprisonment, I was like, this is all a huge mistake. And it's really obviously a huge mistake. And when are when are like the mommies and daddies going to show up and say, Okay, kids, stop your squabbling. Like, let's straighten things out. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3357.5800000000004s)]
*  There's no mommies and daddies. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3385.1s)]
*  There are no mommies and daddies. That's the thing that freaked me out. Yeah, it's like we're all adults now. And this is all we are. We're just a bunch of screaming toddlers just screaming at each other constantly. And here I am now. I feel in a way trying to mother my prosecutor through his, you know, psychological tantrums. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3386.06s)]
*  Oh, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3411.5s)]
*  which is a weird position to be in. Because now that I've, you know, developed the relationship that I've developed with him, I like, like I care about him. Like, I don't think that you can, I set out to understand him, I wanted to understand him. But in the process of like really understanding a human being and having them like, be really [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3413.1s)]
*  open to you. I don't know, I feel like you inevitably begin to care about this person, even in their, you know, flawed fragility as a human being. And so on the one hand, I'm very angry at him to this day. And on the other hand, I care about him and I have to give him some props. He didn't have to respond to me. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3441.38s)]
*  He didn't have to meet with me. He didn't have to sit there and hear me talk about how he had fucked up my life and he shouldn't have. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3470.74s)]
*  I did not like, it's not that like me being kind to him does not mean me tolerating injustice. And it does not mean me not setting boundaries. And it does not mean me sugar coating what really happened. Like he knows what I think really happened. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3481.86s)]
*  And he says, well, you know, we can disagree about our perspectives in some in some ways. But ultimately, what matters is that you reached out to me and saw me as a human being. And in response, I like, I also inevitably came to see you as a human being and I care about you. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3500.18s)]
*  And, and so in a way, like we're still in this awkward dance of like one part of us is stuck in that adversarial system and one part of us is in a non, you know, adversarial, very like accepting of all the things space. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3523.7s)]
*  And we're paradoxically existing in both of them at the same time. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3543.8999999999996s)]
*  And I think that that's just kind of how life is. Like, you know, one of the paradoxes of life is that like, if you really just sit down and sit with yourself and your life just the way it is right now. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3549.46s)]
*  If you really do just like notice right now you and me here we are talking. We are okay. You and me, we are good. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3562.54s)]
*  And also, they're still fucked up shit in my life and they're still fucked up shit in your life and and things could be better and all of those things can be true at the same time. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3571.3s)]
*  Like, you know, I'm still fighting to clear my name in Italy. I don't know if you have you kept up with like the latest with my case. Oh, yeah. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3580.86s)]
*  So, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3589.2200000000003s)]
*  So I've been cleared of like all the crazy, you know, horrible murder orgy all of that stuff cleared. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3590.42s)]
*  The thing that remains and this is just the bane of my fucking existence is when they cleared me of having anything to do with the crime. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3597.2599999999998s)]
*  They left open the possibility that I was present when the crime occurred and I believe the reason that they did this was because they wanted to find me guilty of something. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3607.58s)]
*  And the thing that they found me guilty of was the way lesser crime on the list of all the crimes that were there, which was slander. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3620.7799999999997s)]
*  They accused me of knowingly and willingly falsely accusing an innocent person of having committed this crime because during my interrogation, I was coerced into implicating myself and my boss, Patrick Lumumba, of [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3631.7400000000002s)]
*  Of committing this crime. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3647.82s)]
*  And I immediately retracted it all of that. But that was one of the things that they were holding me accountable for. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3648.78s)]
*  And they to this day, I am still convicted in Italy of knowingly and willingly accusing an innocent man. And for me to knowingly and willingly accuse this innocent man, I would have to have been at the house and known who the victim was. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3656.0600000000004s)]
*  At the moment that I falsely accused this innocent person. Like I would have had to know that he was definitively innocent for this to be the case. And for that to be true. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3676.7s)]
*  I would have to be physically present at the crime, even if I was not participating in it. So the legal standing right now to this day is that I was there. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3687.2599999999998s)]
*  And that when I was interrogated, I knowingly and falsely accused an innocent person. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3697.58s)]
*  I appealed this, by the way, to the European Court of Human Rights, and they ruled in my favor. They said that because I had been denied the right to have an attorney and an interpreter when I was being interrogated, that none of that should ever have been, I should never have been convicted of that. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3707.74s)]
*  And I took that back to Italy. I took that ruling back to Italy and they overturned it. I was actually acquitted of that for a second, but then sent back for retrial recently. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3723.6600000000003s)]
*  And recently, yeah, this is 18 years later, recently was put back on trial for that. This was last year. And I was found guilty again. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3735.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3746.38s)]
*  On the basis, not even of the statements that the police like coerced me into signing, but on my retraction. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3747.66s)]
*  So I hand wrote a retraction of those statements that the police coerced me into signing. And I was like, I'm so confused. I can't testify. Like, I don't know if Patrick did it or not. Like, I just don't know. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3753.82s)]
*  And they said, well, even a confused statement where you're not sure what the truth is, if you were physically present at the crime is slander and you falsely accused an innocent man that you knew to be innocent. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3764.46s)]
*  And so. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3777.1s)]
*  But they have no proof that you were there. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3777.9s)]
*  Exactly. So we're in this like cyclical thing where they're like. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3779.9s)]
*  They just don't want to admit that they fucked up. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3783.1s)]
*  That's what I think. And I'm at this point where I'm like, OK, now what? Because I'm definitively convicted of this thing. And like the legal truth in this case does not represent the actual truth in this case. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3785.18s)]
*  Are they trying to protect themselves from some sort of a civil suit? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3799.98s)]
*  Maybe. I think even more than that, I think they're trying to protect themselves from admitting that they tortured an innocent. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3803.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3812.14s)]
*  Oh my God. So so they can say, well, she is guilty. She did do this. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3813.26s)]
*  She's a good. And so it's not crazy for us to think that she might have been involved in the in the murder. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3818.94s)]
*  Or was here. She is. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3824.38s)]
*  She probably lied about being there. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3826.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3827.9s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3828.3s)]
*  And all they were ever able to do is prove that I lived in the house that this happened in. Like, sure, my DNA is in my house. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3829.6600000000003s)]
*  It's not anywhere near Meredith's body or where the crime occurred. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3836.7799999999997s)]
*  But they're saying that, like, I was there and sort of this, like, cyclical sort of reasoning. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3841.02s)]
*  Like, Amanda said she was there. Therefore, she was there. Therefore, she said she was, you know, like, this is like insane cyclical reasoning. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3845.98s)]
*  And I'm at the point where I have to ask myself, like, how do I fight this? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3855.2599999999998s)]
*  And if so, do I? And that's where this whole question of freedom comes in. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3859.58s)]
*  Like, do I do I have to definitively like prove my innocence in a court of law to feel that I have definitively proved my innocence? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3863.9s)]
*  Or do I need to definitively prove my innocence in the court of public opinion in order to feel free or to feel like I like I'm not regardless of whether I definitively prove my innocence or not? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3872.86s)]
*  Like, am I ever going to be free of this? Is this ever going to be not touching me and impacting my life? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3884.54s)]
*  And the answer that I've come to is, well, no, in the way that, like any of our experiences have come to define us as human beings. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3892.7s)]
*  And in a way, it's like another way of reframing this is, OK, these are my credentials now. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3902.2999999999997s)]
*  Like, I went to the I didn't go to four years of P.A. master's degree in poetry. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3909.26s)]
*  I got a master's degree in. Whatever this is, being fucked, you know, like, and you know, and so like, and I've learned things from this. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3916.6200000000003s)]
*  I've learned I've learned things about the criminal justice system. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3929.46s)]
*  I like I can see things that need to be fixed that have are really common sense fixes to like it. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3932.22s)]
*  There is no reason why we shouldn't be just recording any kind of communication, like any time that anyone is being questioned by anyone in law enforcement. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3940.06s)]
*  There's no reason why we shouldn't be recording it. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3952.14s)]
*  And I'm not talking about even just suspects, because like there's been a whole, you know, world of advocacy around like recording interrogations, right? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3954.9s)]
*  Like custodial interrogations and especially making it so that police officers can't lie to you when you're being interrogated, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3963.82s)]
*  because that was a huge thing that impacted me as like a young, confused, like overwhelmed human being, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3973.06s)]
*  because police lying to me and telling me that they have proof that I was there when the crime occurred, and it made me like feel like I was insane. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3979.78s)]
*  And so like the problem of police lying to you is not just that it's like a bullying technique, but it warps your sense of reality and you start to question yourself. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3986.6600000000003s)]
*  And so there's psychological research to show that there are very negative consequences for police lying to you during interrogation. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=3995.3s)]
*  But at the very least, if you record it, you can sort of track how that is impacting a person who is being who is a suspect. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4002.74s)]
*  The wild west of all of this is eyewitnesses or anyone else who is being questioned by police because there's no Miranda rights. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4009.8999999999996s)]
*  Like as a person who is being questioned by police, you don't really have rights. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4020.2599999999998s)]
*  Like you don't you don't have like one of the things that they say in my case is that I never had the right to an attorney because I wasn't a suspect. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4027.22s)]
*  I was a witness. And so like to this day in Italy, there's like this resistance to the idea that I was like coerced into I was that I was even interrogated at all because there's this like little loophole where they say, oh, you weren't interrogated. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4036.54s)]
*  You were interviewed. Oh, you weren't interviewed. You were questioned. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4051.98s)]
*  They just changed the language. But what's ultimately happening is the same thing. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4055.54s)]
*  You are stuck in a room with a law enforcement officer who may or may not be lying to your face and bullying you. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4059.02s)]
*  And you don't know if you're free or not to go because the door is closed and it doesn't feel like it. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4066.5s)]
*  And so for me, I think that if you consider how many wrongful convictions happen because of misidentification by witnesses or the number of times that like witnesses say, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4072.46s)]
*  well, I wasn't really sure that it was him. But the police sort of coaxed me or pressured me into saying it was him and sort of made it known to me that it was him. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4084.5s)]
*  Like, there are lots of things that are happening behind closed doors that we really don't have an excuse for not fixing when every single one of us has a recording device in our pocket at all times. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4095.7000000000003s)]
*  And the amount of resistance to like getting just really common sense changes like that to happen from like law enforcement lobbies is just so frustrating as someone who like shows up again and again and again to like try to make. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4106.9s)]
*  Because it seems like this adversarial thing like we're we're all on the same side. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4124.26s)]
*  It's not like victims rights versus defendants rights. It's not law enforcement versus, you know, innocence. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4127.94s)]
*  It's like we're all on the same page. Why can't we just acknowledge a true thing? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4134.22s)]
*  That's been one of my biggest frustrations in this world is like feeling like we should all be on the same side and we should be making common sense changes and that don't, you know. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4139.9800000000005s)]
*  That's the way the system is structured. You know, there's two sides trying to win. And when you lose, you don't like to lose. Right. So people would cheat to win. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4151.740000000001s)]
*  But like lose. What are you losing? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4160.900000000001s)]
*  You know, they're playing a game. Yeah. I mean, it's your life and it's other people's lives. It's innocent people's lives. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4163.3s)]
*  But it's also guilty people's lives. But why doesn't like a law enforcement officer look at something that happened to me? Actually, you know, I take that back. Plenty of law enforcement people have talked to me and said, like, we are so sorry for what happened. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4169.18s)]
*  The ones who weren't involved. That's the problem. The problem is, do you look away when you are involved? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4183.1s)]
*  You know, how many law enforcement officers will stick their neck out if they think their partner overstepped their boundaries and got someone to admit to something that maybe they did or didn't do withheld evidence that may or may not have exonerated someone. Like there's steps along the way on the road to evil. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4191.34s)]
*  Right. And no one gets rewarded for sticking their neck out or for holding their friends accountable. Yeah, you get exa you get [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4209.38s)]
*  excommunicated from your tribe. It's very dangerous. You know, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4219.860000000001s)]
*  So how do we motivate [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4224.06s)]
*  Any other like how [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4226.780000000001s)]
*  It's a real problem. It's a it's a giant conundrum. It's a real problem in the way this the system is structured. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4228.18s)]
*  And the feeling that you have to like in order to do the right thing. You just have to switch sides like that really bothers me also because like one thing that I have. I would love to see more of is more of like a collaboration between victims rights advocates and innocence rights advocates. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4234.5s)]
*  But like oftentimes you see us sort of pitted against each other as if like, you know, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4253.9400000000005s)]
*  I've always felt that the the criminal justice system never did enough for victims. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4261.9s)]
*  That like the only compensation that victims are really given is the idea that you're going to punish the perpetrator and I've always wanted to know how is the system. How is the system going to help the victim. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4268.7s)]
*  Rebuild their life and take back and like reclaim what can be reclaimed of their experience and be uplifted and that's supposedly where the civil [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4285.06s)]
*  Supposedly, but like you're you're you're suing the person who committed the crime and are you ever actually going to get any money from them. Are you like [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4295.580000000001s)]
*  Well, sometimes money is awarded to families by the state. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4303.580000000001s)]
*  State. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4306.9s)]
*  You know, there's those. But I mean, is that enough like is monies. Is that enough, you know, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4308.94s)]
*  No, I don't think so. I think that people need more support than that. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4315.219999999999s)]
*  What is the support, though, like what would make it right. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4321.82s)]
*  Well, I think overhaul the system. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4326.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4328.379999999999s)]
*  Really, the only way that to truly make it right is to find. I mean, if you're if you're a person like I think [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4329.34s)]
*  Your approach this all this radical acceptance and forgiveness is very, very, very beautiful. It's, it's amazing that you can do it. It's amazing that you think the way you think. And, you know, I used you as an example. The other day we're having this conversation about [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4335.58s)]
*  Horrible things that have happened to people that have made that person a beautiful person because you you went through this insane thing. But on the other end of it, you came out this like really interesting person. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4352.22s)]
*  Oh, well, they are. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4365.3s)]
*  You really are. I used you as an example of [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4366.780000000001s)]
*  Things that don't break you, but that you would never want to wish on anyone else. But then the result of that as this person comes out extraordinary. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4370.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's a lot of the obstacles the way kind of stuff. I mean, it's a lot of stuff that I write about in the book actually is one of the things that my goal with this book was to try to [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4378.42s)]
*  Like, yes, what happened to me is like, oh, crazy story happened to a girl one time, but also there are like universal lessons and truths that I've derived from from my experience that make me [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4389.02s)]
*  And when I communicate them, they make me feel less ostracized or less like singled out as a human being. And one of those is like there is opportunity in every tragedy. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4401.78s)]
*  And I think that what my tragedy challenged me to do was to not be broken by it. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4416.1s)]
*  And my definition of being broken by it was coming out of it. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4428.66s)]
*  A person who was angry and and embittered and and diminished by this experience and I just the the rebellious side of me was like fuck that what matters to me. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4436.900000000001s)]
*  What matters to me is the truth and is compassion curiosity compassion. Those are things that I genuinely care about and having the courage to [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4454.740000000001s)]
*  Approach human beings and situations that are painful and that are wrong. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4470.5s)]
*  With the open heart that it requires to have compassion and genuine curiosity. That is what I wanted to define me. I did not want this horrible experience to define me on its terms. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4477.3s)]
*  I wanted to define me on my own terms. And I think the challenge that any one of us has is remembering what even our terms are when we're feeling sort of overconfident. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4491.38s)]
*  Remembering what even our terms are when we're feeling sort of overwhelmed with the the existential crisis of it all. And and the and the and the [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4503.46s)]
*  I think the one of the biggest mistakes that people make is they are stuck. They are fixated. They dwell on the life that they should have lived. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4513.78s)]
*  Instead of acknowledging and accepting that this is the life that they are living. And when you are acting in the world as if you are living the life that you should have lived. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4523.139999999999s)]
*  You are inevitably becoming ineffective. Like if I were to approach the world and be like my prosecutor never should have done this to me and [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4538.0199999999995s)]
*  And and my I never should have gone to prison and people should never should have villainized me in the press. I would just find myself debilitated utterly debilitated by the fact that reality is other than that. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4546.900000000001s)]
*  And I would just find myself angry and and and and bitter about it all. And instead I go well. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4558.5s)]
*  All of that happened. Now what. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4568.42s)]
*  And by accepting reality and life as it is I can now become in a more effective agent in my life. I don't want to live my life. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4571.219999999999s)]
*  Acting and feeling and thinking in ways that are not going to be effective. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4582.259999999999s)]
*  And so instead what happens and the radical acceptance of it all is truly coming from a place of [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4586.259999999999s)]
*  Not I'm not trying to be Christian about it. I'm just trying to like not be the completely and utterly overwhelmed and disempowered person that I was when I was in prison. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4593.78s)]
*  Like I I lost so much. I had so little control of my life. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4608.66s)]
*  And I think in the end all of us do. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4616.5s)]
*  I feel like I weirdly had a midlife crisis when I was 20 because my entire life fell apart or I was on I was I was put on this this track this train that just like left the station and was going on its own and there was really nothing I could do to stop it. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4619.7s)]
*  And so okay now what. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4634.9800000000005s)]
*  That's a great way to put it like you're on a train that you can't stop. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4638.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah I mean what you've done is admirable. I mean the approach that you take is really I mean if. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4644.42s)]
*  Is it admirable is it self-serving like is it just like. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4650.5s)]
*  It's not self-serving obviously it's self-serving but that's a good thing. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4653.780000000001s)]
*  I mean you're serving yourself in the best possible way and to not be completely defined by. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4657.46s)]
*  You're being victimized you you've risen above it. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4664.740000000001s)]
*  I mean just the fact that you contacted the prosecutor and tried to reach out and talk to him as a human being and try to find out. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4670.820000000001s)]
*  And accept him where he's at. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4678.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4679.860000000001s)]
*  Like this is where you're at. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4680.34s)]
*  Well he's a kind of a victim in a way because he shouldn't have had the kind of power that he had. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4681.540000000001s)]
*  There's no checks and balances that are put in place to make sure the person's ego is not overwhelming them to the point where their initial idea of a conspiracy. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4687.7s)]
*  And he's also not in a vacuum like there were other people around him who were like building. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4695.7s)]
*  Building him up and supporting that story and you know like. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4700.42s)]
*  Well it's also like he's in a position of power they're underneath him. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4703.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4706.66s)]
*  You know there's this weird. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4706.74s)]
*  Structure that's in place. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4707.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4708.58s)]
*  All of that can be true. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4708.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah all that. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4710.02s)]
*  And I can accept that as also true and I think there's this like weird resistance that people have to accepting the context around a person. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4710.74s)]
*  Maybe because you feel like you're not being true. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4719.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4722.74s)]
*  And I think that's the way that we're going to be. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4723.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4725.22s)]
*  And I think that's the way that we're going to be. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4725.46s)]
*  And I think that's the way that we're going to be. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4727.62s)]
*  That people have to accepting the context around a person. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4729.54s)]
*  Maybe because you've you realize that if you accept the context around the person that feeling of self-righteousness that you're ultimately grasping on to dissipates because it does inevitably dissipate. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4735.86s)]
*  But I think that's again a that's a symptom of someone dwelling on the life that they should have lived. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4750.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4755.94s)]
*  Instead of accepting the life that they have. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4756.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4758.34s)]
*  And I just find that to be a waste of time. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4760.5s)]
*  It is not just a waste of time. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4763.06s)]
*  It's the opposite of self-serving. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4765.06s)]
*  It kind of destroys you from within because you know it's not true. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4766.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4770.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4770.9s)]
*  And so you're bullshitting yourself as you're bullshitting the world. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4771.62s)]
*  And that's who you are now. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4776.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4778.1s)]
*  I think that is a scary trap that victims can fall into is like how you then become self-destructive. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4779.14s)]
*  In your own mind as a result of someone having been destructive towards you. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4789.54s)]
*  That is I think that is the deepest tragedy of of hurt is how it can then become implosive. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4795.3s)]
*  And I did not want to implode. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4804.82s)]
*  I was scared to implode. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4807.54s)]
*  I saw a lot of people around me in prison imploding and I did not want that to be me. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4809.06s)]
*  Insane mental resolve to not. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4815.38s)]
*  And that's it's the trap that most people are going to fall into. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4818.18s)]
*  And to a lesser extent he's a victim as well. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4822.66s)]
*  He's a victim of his own actions and he will it will haunt me. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4825.7s)]
*  I mean he's defined by that as well now particularly that everybody knows that you're [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4828.74s)]
*  innocent and that you've been proven innocent and then in the retrial you got proven again. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4833.46s)]
*  And so that's him that's over his head everywhere he goes. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4839.86s)]
*  He wrongly prosecuted and jailed you for a murder you did not commit. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4844.98s)]
*  And he has to live with that every day when he wakes up and he looks in the mirror. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4850.58s)]
*  That's who you are bitch forever. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4853.78s)]
*  And you could dance around you know I was doing my job and this you can you can have [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4856.9s)]
*  you know that's that's where you kind of try to find some sort of no no you did. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4863.0599999999995s)]
*  This thing you were wrong you your ego whatever the fuck it was that led you to. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4868.9s)]
*  Come up with the initial theory and then try to use confirmation bias to. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4877.62s)]
*  Reinforce it at every step of the way. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4886.34s)]
*  That's you. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4889.139999999999s)]
*  And if he doesn't admit that he will go to his grave haunted. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4890.9s)]
*  And I think what's a really interesting thing for me is discovering what can come [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4895.38s)]
*  from approaching someone recognizing that so. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4903.54s)]
*  When I approached him I approached him in a really unconventional way right like I'm [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4909.9400000000005s)]
*  trying to find common ground with this person I'm trying to I'm very I'm deeply genuinely [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4914.1s)]
*  curious about this person I am primed to feel compassion for this person because that is [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4918.900000000001s)]
*  just the mental and intentional space that I put myself in in approaching him. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4924.5s)]
*  And the surprising dividends that arise from that. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4933.3s)]
*  Because I think everyone is evolving you know one is static even he is on his own [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4937.54s)]
*  journey is on his own path and I'm not in control of his path. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4944.66s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that I can't be a very compelling influence of all the people in [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4948.580000000001s)]
*  the world who could be nice to him and have that have an impact on him. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4955.3s)]
*  Me and like recognizing like I didn't really fully comprehend that until I sat down with him. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4961.620000000001s)]
*  And like I sort of in my mind. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4970.42s)]
*  And I realized what it looked like from my position like here's this person who had this [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4972.5s)]
*  overwhelming impact on my life. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4978.9s)]
*  And and to this day like continue like this story that he made up like took over my life [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4982.02s)]
*  and continues to take over my life like this is what I'm going to live with for the rest [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4987.14s)]
*  of my life is because of him this person who has had this outsized influence on my well-being and [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4990.18s)]
*  my personhood in my existence this guy. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=4997.7s)]
*  I sit down across from him and I'm nice to him. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5001.7s)]
*  And I walk away from that encounter realizing that his well-being depends on me much more so [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5008.98s)]
*  than my well-being depends on him. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5022.82s)]
*  And I think because deep down he understands that there is this dynamic that you know whatever [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5024.66s)]
*  stories he can tell himself about what happened. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5033.0599999999995s)]
*  He was the one who was in power and I was the one who went to prison. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5037.46s)]
*  And for me to be kind to him. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5042.74s)]
*  I didn't have to do that. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5051.94s)]
*  He had never had it happen before it was unheard of. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5055.62s)]
*  And as a spiritual person he experienced it in a spiritual way. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5059.46s)]
*  Me I came out of that experience feeling like a fucking superhero. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5066.099999999999s)]
*  I've never felt more powerful in my life than when I sat across from him and was kind to him. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5071.7s)]
*  And it didn't matter what he said or what he did because I showed up. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5079.78s)]
*  And that was I was not expecting that to happen. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5086.34s)]
*  That was not how I expected to feel. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5091.86s)]
*  It surprised me. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5095.94s)]
*  But like it had such an impact on me that I felt like I had discovered something about [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5098.5s)]
*  about trauma and about healing and about people and dynamics. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5106.9800000000005s)]
*  And in a world that is so conflicted and where the people are you know not building bridges. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5115.38s)]
*  They're blowing them up. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5122.740000000001s)]
*  I was like I wanted to remind people of what happens when you take a chance and you take a stand. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5125.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5136.1s)]
*  Well that kind of kindness is rewarded by the universe. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5136.9800000000005s)]
*  And that was the feeling that you got that you were on the right path to like the best [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5141.46s)]
*  possible person that you could be. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5148.02s)]
*  What would the best possible version of you do? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5150.34s)]
*  And you did that and then you had that feeling because of that. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5153.860000000001s)]
*  That was the universe telling you right this is the best thing you can do. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5157.700000000001s)]
*  You could yell at that guy and call him a piece of shit and slap him in the face. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5163.78s)]
*  And feel justified in doing so as well. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5167.22s)]
*  And you would be. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5169.54s)]
*  And that might even feel a little good in a way but it wouldn't feel like that good. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5170.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5175.139999999999s)]
*  Negativity always no matter what leaves you with this residue. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5175.86s)]
*  This like icky even if you're correct just like slime that's on this psychic slime. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5183.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5192.9s)]
*  That's on you no matter what. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5193.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5195.3s)]
*  And that's your power that you could sit across this person and treat them with compassion. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5196.1s)]
*  And that's why you felt that way. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5203.7s)]
*  You know it's like. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5205.54s)]
*  Have you ever felt that way? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5206.5s)]
*  I've never had anything remotely like your situation. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5208.5s)]
*  But you've had encounters with people. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5213.54s)]
*  Like I don't think you have to have as devastating of a situation to like be in a position to know [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5218.74s)]
*  that you're doing the right thing in a moment. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5225.7s)]
*  Like for instance when my husband got up in his whitey tighties and walked down the stairs [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5227.94s)]
*  to put himself between me and my family and his family and this crazy guy. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5232.5s)]
*  I feel like maybe he felt that in that moment. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5237.62s)]
*  Like total clarity of purpose. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5240.5s)]
*  And it didn't really matter what happened because he was doing the thing that had to be done [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5245.14s)]
*  in that moment and there was no confusion. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5255.54s)]
*  I think that like when I talk about it with him today like to this day he's just like I was just [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5259.38s)]
*  not confused. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5265.46s)]
*  I knew exactly what I needed. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5267.22s)]
*  I didn't even think it was that flow state even that they talk about and like tap tap tap tap. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5268.900000000001s)]
*  You and the universe are moving in the exact in sync. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5276.02s)]
*  And that was my version of it. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5281.700000000001s)]
*  That was his version of it. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5283.62s)]
*  And I think that all of us have the opportunity to glimpse that in our lives. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5284.9800000000005s)]
*  And I'm just curious if you've ever felt like you were moving in sync with the universe. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5290.18s)]
*  I try to be. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5295.3s)]
*  But again I haven't. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5297.14s)]
*  You still feel kind of slimy. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5298.1s)]
*  Well I've had moments where I haven't. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5300.900000000001s)]
*  I've had moments where I was very negative and attacked back and I never feel good about it. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5302.58s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why I don't engage with people online that are negative. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5308.42s)]
*  Especially particularly like the lowest level of it is social media. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5316.18s)]
*  I'm not interested in conflict. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5321.22s)]
*  I'm not interested in it. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5323.3s)]
*  I don't want to do it. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5324.26s)]
*  Even if someone has negative things to say about me I'm not really interested in engaging. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5325.62s)]
*  I don't think it's valuable. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5330.98s)]
*  You know I think it's a trap. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5332.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5335.3s)]
*  But it's not the same situation as what you were in. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5335.62s)]
*  I don't know how I would be. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5338.1s)]
*  Because the other danger is like you know I don't want to consider myself above criticism say. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5340.74s)]
*  Like that's what I think the other flip side of that of like of having confidence is potentially [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5350.66s)]
*  having the confidence that my prosecutor had when was he feeling in sync with the universe [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5356.42s)]
*  when he was prosecuting me. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5361.3s)]
*  Did he clearly not. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5363.06s)]
*  There's no way. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5365.46s)]
*  No. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5366.9800000000005s)]
*  But that's not confidence. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5367.7s)]
*  That's ego. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5369.46s)]
*  Confidence is an objective analysis of all the facts doing the right thing having a rock solid [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5370.820000000001s)]
*  ethical and moral foundation and knowing you're doing the right thing and knowing you can do it. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5378.9800000000005s)]
*  That's confidence. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5385.62s)]
*  What he had was ego. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5387.860000000001s)]
*  You know this desire to you know when people are in a position like that where people's freedom [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5390.9800000000005s)]
*  hangs on your decisions and what you do and what you don't do and then you do it for so [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5400.26s)]
*  many years and you see so many people prosecuted you just get calloused about it. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5406.34s)]
*  You see it with doctors where doctors you know they they have this some not all some [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5411.54s)]
*  doctors develop this very callous feeling whether someone lives or dies they don't care anymore. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5419.14s)]
*  They're so used to people dying you know I mean there's doctors that do surgeries that [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5424.1s)]
*  are completely unnecessary just because they want the money. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5428.42s)]
*  We were talking the other day about this guy who is a oncologist who treated people with [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5431.54s)]
*  chemotherapy who did not have cancer because he wanted the money and it was he was convicted. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5437.860000000001s)]
*  It was like I think it was some insane number of people took this horrible poison to try to [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5443.86s)]
*  kill the cancer inside of them and ruin their lives and ruin and there was nothing wrong with [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5449.62s)]
*  them. Wow. Yeah because there's and I think his justification was even more sick. His justification [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5454.179999999999s)]
*  was that he was always taught that you eat what you kill and in that business in the business of [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5462.259999999999s)]
*  being a surgeon and a business of being a doctor like you have to perform this medicine in order [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5466.66s)]
*  to get money and this is the incentive structure that's put in front of you. I don't know if you [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5474.5s)]
*  know that but chemotherapy is one of the most profitable things that a doctor can prescribe. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5478.74s)]
*  They actually get an enormous amount of money from each individual person that they yeah there's [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5484.34s)]
*  also some very twisted and bizarre financial incentives. Again these institutions that get [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5492.42s)]
*  warped by these various. Exactly I mean this is the case with vaccinations this is the case [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5497.700000000001s)]
*  with prescriptions of various medicines there's kickbacks and these kickbacks become incentives [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5503.9400000000005s)]
*  and you know and then you have the overwhelming burden of the financial responsibility that you [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5510.34s)]
*  have with your medical school debt and then you have malpractice insurance which is overwhelming. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5516.66s)]
*  You have overhead you have staff you have a bunch of people and then people start justifying things [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5523.7s)]
*  in a very twisted way and it's because of the system and you have to be an incredibly powerful [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5528.82s)]
*  person to rise above that and to say this is not what I'm going to do even if it means I can't do [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5534.5s)]
*  this anymore I'm not doing this and then the weakest amongst us just instead they go the other [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5539.54s)]
*  way and say I'll just justify what no one is going to know I was yeah you got cancer yeah I'm sorry [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5546.18s)]
*  you know we're just going to I want to give her a low dose of chemotherapy for like six weeks [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5552.42s)]

*  like this godlike power that you know that you are imposing this medication on this person that [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5560.34s)]
*  absolutely does not need it and that person doesn't know any better yeah that's fucking dark. Well you [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5566.5s)]
*  could go darker you could go darker with medical transition of children you know this whole [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5573.14s)]
*  gender affirming care thing where you're taking young kids and convincing them they need to be [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5580.58s)]
*  chemically castrated or physically castrated right there's that's there's a lot of weirdness [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5584.820000000001s)]
*  in the world yeah there's a lot of there's evil is a real thing and the motivation to do these [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5591.06s)]
*  things can be very very hidden and masked with all sorts of incentives and the structure in which [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5597.06s)]
*  this institution was sort of created and that's that's the world we're living in and it's not a [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=5603.860000000001s)]

*  of like being kind to this person who did this thing to you how it made you empowered i really [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6028.0199999999995s)]

*  how to do that on a much lesser scale i i see that with friends who are famous who read comments [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6045.9400000000005s)]
*  about them or read articles and get infuriated it ruins vacations because they have to type up a [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6054.58s)]
*  response yeah the impulse to respond is like you don't have to not only do you not should you not [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6060.02s)]
*  respond you shouldn't read what they're saying in the first place you shouldn't pay attention is there [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6067.22s)]
*  an ever like i i wonder if the fear is and maybe this is my fear because i'm always questioning [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6072.18s)]
*  myself is like is there i always want to like at least hear it and like cycle the thought through [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6078.34s)]
*  my mind so that i can test the validity of it in my mind yes there's definitely that sure but to a [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6087.06s)]
*  point you should probably do that yourself without those people that's the best way the best way is [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6095.46s)]
*  to have an internal auditing system where you look at your own life and say did what did i do that i [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6102.34s)]
*  could have done better right and what what about is there anything about what i'm doing that feels [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6110.1s)]
*  icky right is there anything about the way i'm capitalizing on this that feels icky or feels [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6115.14s)]
*  conflicted is there anything about it that i don't like right but just do that yourself you don't [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6123.06s)]

*  yeah let me help as a person who's been famous for a long time don't do it okay there's no value [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6148.34s)]
*  in it there's zero value in it i mean there's times where i was forced into responding like during [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6155.9400000000005s)]
*  the whole covid situation when cnn was saying i was taking veterinary medicine and you were like [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6161.3s)]
*  i need to clarify reality or not also i need to say hey fuck you because the world should say [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6166.74s)]
*  fuck you you're not supposed to be able to do that you're not supposed to be able to be the news [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6172.26s)]
*  and lie and then hold yourself to this moral high ground and say we have to stop misinformation [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6176.26s)]
*  what about you motherfucker like what about you you know and so there's that like i've had to [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6181.46s)]
*  respond in that way but i mean if i responded to everything that everybody ever says about me i'd [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6188.02s)]
*  have no time for my children for my family for my life for my job i would have no time for anything [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6191.860000000001s)]
*  but you can't do it you just you have to have an internal auditing system where you look at [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6199.62s)]
*  yourself and you have to be your own worst judge yeah you know anything anybody says about me that [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6206.58s)]
*  tries to make me feel bad well guess what i'm way harsher to me than you are and i know me [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6211.46s)]
*  you know and that's right but you know all the dark thoughts and the slimy feelings but that's why [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6217.22s)]
*  i work really hard to be a good person i work really hard to be a good person because i don't [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6221.94s)]
*  like those feelings i don't like the when i judge myself and i find myself to be lacking [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6226.26s)]
*  i don't like it so i institute a lot of self-discipline and i institute a lot of [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6231.9400000000005s)]
*  introspective thinking yeah what is your what's your auditing like what's your self-auditing [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6238.9800000000005s)]
*  process well first of all it's like why are you doing what you're doing with your life [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6243.780000000001s)]
*  like what uh why why do you why do you do a podcast why do you do comedy why do you do [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6252.18s)]
*  anything why do you do what you do yeah i so the best way i approach it is i do it because [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6257.780000000001s)]
*  i love what i do i'm intrigued i'm curious and i do my best always do my best now if i half ask [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6266.9800000000005s)]
*  something it will haunt me like if i have a bad podcast interview if i don't if i think i interrupted [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6275.38s)]
*  too much or if i didn't ask the right questions like that'll fuck with me for the rest of the day [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6281.7s)]
*  like i don't need other people to fuck with me i fuck with myself i really do i so i so the best [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6286.099999999999s)]
*  response to that is do better every time every time like sit when you sit down be as open as [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6292.26s)]
*  possible to try to like don't let all these little weird mind-fucking things enter into your head [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6299.38s)]
*  just try to be pure try to be genuinely curious like what's your genuine feelings about these [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6307.860000000001s)]
*  things and then did you did you handle it well if you didn't what could you've done better [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6314.26s)]
*  right well then work on that yeah that's all you can do i think one of the things that i am i [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6319.46s)]
*  worry about is that people only feel safe when they're either being self-righteous [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6326.02s)]
*  or when they're being cynical yeah and like genuine compassion or curiosity is looked down upon [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6337.620000000001s)]
*  as naive and a wit and a weakness and but i feel like the only way to be truly ethical is to be [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6346.66s)]
*  exposed in that way cynicism and self-righteousness are shields they are ways of approaching the world [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6358.74s)]
*  with with with a barrier yes and absolutely and so i i [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6366.58s)]
*  and i can't promise anyone that doing things my way which is like really trying to like push back [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6373.86s)]
*  against those impulses which i recognize as being dangerous impulses [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6380.34s)]
*  is going to necessarily lead to good things like it's like it's not your job to promise people that [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6387.14s)]
*  it's not your job is your job is for you for your your soul whoever you are it's to speak to what [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6392.74s)]
*  what is the right path for you you don't you know you don't have to promise these people this is [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6401.38s)]
*  the burden of being a public figure like you're not you're not a role model for all these people [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6407.62s)]
*  if you are a role model for these people because they find you admirable that's great but your [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6413.78s)]
*  responsibility is to your yourself your responsibilities to your own mind and the [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6418.42s)]
*  people that you come in contact with so your responsibility is not to like say like don't be [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6423.54s)]
*  cynical be kind and oh it didn't work out for you oh fuck i fucked up it's me it's on me no it's on [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6430.02s)]
*  them it's on them it's on you everyone has their own soul their own mind their own path and you [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6435.62s)]
*  have to find out what's right for you in doing what you're doing you are most certainly a role [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6444.66s)]
*  model and you most certainly will be a role model for including me i i find myself admiring like [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6450.58s)]
*  when we had the first podcast i thought about it for a long time i would think about it all [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6457.94s)]
*  throughout the day sometimes like randomly i would just think about imagining myself in your position [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6462.1s)]
*  and how would i be and i you know i don't know i i can't answer it but i i admire the position [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6469.14s)]
*  that you've taken i think it's incredible i think it's a great it's a great example to the world of [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6477.14s)]
*  what's possible if someone is thrust into a horrible position it's totally beyond their [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6483.860000000001s)]
*  control but what is in your control what's in your control is how you respond to it and how you [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6488.820000000001s)]
*  responded to it was incredibly admirable that's that's your responsibilities to yourself and you [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6494.98s)]
*  did a great job with it a fantastic job exemplary i don't think there's any buddy else that i could [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6500.9s)]
*  point to that's ever been through anything even remotely close to what you've been through and [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6506.339999999999s)]
*  come out the way you have the only examples that maybe i could point to are some of the people that [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6510.5s)]
*  i've dealt with through josh where we brought people in that were wrongly accused that went [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6515.94s)]
*  through these horrible incarcerations and came out of the other side these incredibly well read [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6520.9s)]
*  brilliant articulate people that are so thoughtful and so introspective so and can and then made the [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6526.42s)]
*  time in prison empower them it can be done and those are those are examples but the responsibility [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6534.58s)]
*  is to yourself it's not to these other people i guess like i think that's so i mean thank you [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6543.299999999999s)]
*  and i agree like i've met very incredible people who have made the most of a bad situation which [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6549.3s)]
*  ultimately that's what it comes down to i guess my one pushback might be that i have come to realize [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6555.94s)]
*  that we are so interconnected like we are all influencing each other constantly yes and so on [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6563.62s)]
*  the one hand yes i'm only answerable ultimately to myself but when i really sit down and like sit [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6573.78s)]
*  with it like part of the reason why i was able to approach my prosecutor with the perspective that [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6581.7s)]
*  i had was realizing that like there is a fluidity between us and all of us where we're all influencing [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6588.82s)]
*  each other and people in his life have now like the influences in his life people i will never [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6597.78s)]
*  have met haven't have had direct influences in my life because it's been like this fluid path like [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6603.38s)]
*  this connectedness between me and him me and you any any person we talk to any person we encounter [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6612.1s)]
*  is going to then have this ripple effect and so on the one hand yes like i'm a drop but i'm also [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6618.5s)]
*  a drop in an ocean that has a ripple effect and that ripple is going to interact with your ripple [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6624.42s)]
*  and and all these other ripples and and so yes i am answerable to myself [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6629.14s)]
*  but i also feel like i can't ignore the potential impact that my ripple might have on another person [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6637.54s)]
*  and i've been really rewarded in the way that i have i've been those ripples have been communicated [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6647.14s)]
*  to me like i've had someone tell me that they didn't kill themselves because one day they heard [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6654.18s)]
*  me you know in an interview and and like that they were going to kill themselves and they didn't [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6659.62s)]
*  and like i've had someone tell me that and like i never in my wildest dreams thought that me just [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6665.9400000000005s)]
*  deciding to like have a conversation with someone one day on a podcast would save a human being's [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6672.18s)]
*  life but like those are those like the interconnected fluidness of all of us that like i also [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6677.46s)]
*  can't discount you shouldn't and that i think about a lot well you should i mean you are an example [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=6686.1s)]

*  because they have certain ideas about what meditating is and like it's shutting off your [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8266.419999999998s)]
*  thoughts and it's like well you know eventually you might be able to do that but ultimately it's [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8272.5s)]
*  just sitting down and noticing your thoughts yeah that arise but i like to say that anyone who can [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8276.74s)]

*  masturbate because they don't have any arms you still meditate exactly and you get ultimately to [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8293.78s)]
*  a similar place of like just single-minded focus and bliss so go for it hopefully don't hold back [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8298.58s)]

*  and is just like reacting like a monkey but also another thing that monkeys are famous for is just [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8366.18s)]

*  it's very difficult to do accurately especially at distance right so when i practice i practice it [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8553.94s)]
*  most of the time i practice in at about 85 yards and the amount of movement like so if you're at [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8561.460000000001s)]

*  saying that legolas is a badass is what i'm hearing who legolas from lord of the rings oh [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8589.539999999999s)]
*  i'm not that's not a real person i'm applying it to human beings okay fine that there's this [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8599.46s)]
*  repeatable technique that you have to do it involves breathing and focus and concentration [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8607.779999999999s)]
*  and uh there's actually a whole process that i go through there's this guy named joel turner who [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8616.259999999998s)]
*  was a uh he was a swat instructor and a lead guy in hostage situations where you know someone [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8622.58s)]
*  would like have a child hostage you had to shoot the guy who was like holding a knife to a child [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8632.02s)]
*  and he's he's had situations like that where you have to be completely focused on the task [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8638.02s)]
*  and so he developed this process of talking yourself through a shot with this you have these [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8644.18s)]
*  words that you say and you repeat in your mind while you're going through all of these various [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8653.460000000001s)]
*  techniques so when you're drawing a bow back you draw back you have to anchor so you put this [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8660.18s)]
*  string in a very particular part of your mouth every time my knuckle this finger goes underneath [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8667.3s)]
*  my jaw in the exact same spot every time my elbow goes up in the exact same spot and then it's [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8674.9s)]
*  staying still and concentrating on the target and pulling through and you can't think about anything [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8683.38s)]
*  else it's so overwhelming that you have to focus if you want to be accurate you have to focus [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8690.02s)]
*  only on that and in doing so the world just goes away the world goes away because it requires so [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8697.300000000001s)]

*  that you have entered into in order to perfectly align yourself with the bow and the arrow does that [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8817.3s)]
*  moment of release ever ever result in some kind of unconscious processing coming into your [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8824.9s)]
*  consciousness so like some kind of a new awareness of something that you've been trying to figure out [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8834.42s)]
*  and it like is a catalyst for you figuring out what you need like that feeling of like being in [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8840.1s)]
*  sync with the universe and knowing what you need to do do you ever find yourself like in the moment [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8845.94s)]
*  that you are like immediately exiting that flow state do you real do you feel more clarity about [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8851.22s)]
*  your life or what you need to do or or that thing that you weren't thinking about like your to-do [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8859.14s)]
*  list or your bills or that argument that you've had with somebody that you care about like does [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8863.46s)]
*  anything come into focus or do you find you you walk away from an encounter in jiu-jitsu like knowing [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8867.46s)]
*  not just feeling better emotionally but like knowing what you need to do next i think more [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8874.26s)]
*  so with jiu-jitsu with archery it's just you know because it's so hard to do at the end it's such a [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8879.46s)]
*  singular thing you're just doing this one thing over and over and over again like i'll do it like [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8887.779999999999s)]
*  a hundred times in a day the the thing is like okay what did i do right what did i do wrong [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8892.099999999999s)]
*  like what why did that shot go bad like what minute adjustments yeah just minute adjustments [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8898.9s)]
*  and again it's just a clarity i'm sorry about my throat people yeah no worries it's um it's just [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8904.82s)]
*  a clarity of analysis of technique and of execution so it's it's so overwhelming it's so singular in [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8910.82s)]
*  in in the focus that you don't really think about anything else so there's no room for like oh now [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8920.02s)]
*  i know what i did wrong in my life like yeah i guess i one of the benefits that i get from [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8926.02s)]
*  meditation is feeling like when i come out of meditation i feel like i i have a clarity of [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8931.06s)]
*  purpose that i might not have had because i was i had monkey mind right and i was busy i was [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8937.06s)]
*  distracted and i was using my bandwidth was so much and so much you just tune down what your [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8944.34s)]
*  bandwidth is like paying attention to and then you re-enter the world with a renewed sense of [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8950.34s)]
*  clarity and you're not as distracted you're not on that treadmill of thought yeah i think that [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8956.98s)]
*  comes to me at least that comes much more through rigorous exercise that makes sense yeah that's [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8962.66s)]
*  at the end of a really hard workout and sauna and stretching stretching is always great too [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8970.26s)]
*  that's a good time for reflection after it's over and it's like this wind down cool down and then [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8975.22s)]
*  i'm just i always feel so much nicer that's the one thing i really like about it like after i work [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8982.18s)]
*  out i feel so much nicer like i want to be i'm a good person now i just want to be nice to people [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8986.58s)]
*  i want to smile and say hi to everybody like all the weirdness of being a man it just goes away [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8991.3s)]
*  you know the weirdness of being a man i do think that i am i do not envy you being a man [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=8999.38s)]
*  oh my god it's the best i don't have you being a woman yeah really yeah oh no i much prefer [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9005.86s)]
*  being a woman of course you're a woman i mean testosterone is a hell of a drug my friend like [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9011.14s)]
*  what the hell is that testosterone i don't want to deal with that it's interesting but you have [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9017.06s)]
*  some you have more testosterone than you have estrogen what yeah yeah women have more testosterone [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9022.34s)]
*  than they have estrogen but i've never felt the impulse to punch a wall you know i mean either [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9028.58s)]
*  that's stupid okay well punch walls well you have an outlet for your punching energy but like [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9032.98s)]
*  i don't know i mean what i mean is like that innate elevate like an elevated level of aggression [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9039.38s)]
*  that just is not like accessible to me as as a as a woman is that wrong am i like inaccurate in this [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9045.460000000001s)]
*  i just feel like i don't know what i would do if i wanted to just like jerk off all the time like [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9053.86s)]
*  i just don't understand what that is like and that seems over like [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9060.02s)]
*  that doesn't seem fun to deal with um yeah well you don't really want to jerk off all the time [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9067.220000000001s)]
*  unless you're a sex addict you know and then you probably got other deal issues you're dealing with [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9074.1s)]
*  um but the aggression thing [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9080.5s)]
*  it's not just like aggression for no reason like you only have aggression for a reason [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9084.58s)]
*  like i never have aggression for i'm never like walking around fucking mad at everything [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9089.78s)]
*  there's never never it's never the case and um but i also i work out a lot so i get out i get it out [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9094.5s)]
*  of my system it's just a thing like you just have to maintain you just have to maintain your life [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9104.74s)]
*  you have to maintain your body you have to recognize you have biological needs and as a man [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9109.86s)]
*  i think one of those needs is you have to exercise to to just calm yourself to relieve anxiety and [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9116.66s)]
*  again that's that term that is used often but i think it's the right term voluntary adversity [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9123.14s)]
*  you show up at class you work out really hard you show up at the gym you work out really hard [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9128.9s)]
*  and then when it's over you're like you feel better you feel good like you're nicer like strong [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9133.7s)]
*  powerful people can be the nicest people because they don't have to be nice they're being nice [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9141.06s)]
*  because they want to be nice there's a lot of weak feeble men that pretend that they're nice [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9147.78s)]
*  but really what they are is just vulnerable they're they have to be nice because they don't have any [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9152.5s)]
*  choice like if you and if they were in a position of not having to then they would they would drop [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9159.7s)]
*  the nice act and that's what happens there's some of the creepiest fucking people when they have power [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9165.86s)]
*  it's like really weak men they're some of the scariest people and they're the scariest people [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9170.74s)]
*  as politicians they're just really weak men that all of a sudden have power i'm gonna fucking show [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9174.980000000001s)]
*  you but it's like having real power is to be kind when you don't have to be kind you know what i [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9180.1s)]
*  love about being a woman though what that i do think is a genuine thing and a genuine difference [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9187.380000000001s)]
*  is it's easier for me to be nurturing in the sense that like no one would bat an eye if i saw a kid [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9192.5s)]
*  who was like i couldn't figure out where their mom was and i were to approach them and say come here [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9203.06s)]
*  honey let me help you right as a man like do you second like i know that like my husband has told [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9208.26s)]
*  me this that like he second guesses like hanging out at you know with the kids at the at the park [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9214.18s)]
*  because someone might think that he is a pedophile oh that's crazy hanging out with his kids yeah [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9221.3s)]
*  because like if you're just like a guy sitting on a bench and your kids are playing like how does [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9226.74s)]
*  anyone know you aren't just a guy i think he's really overthinking things like of course you're [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9230.74s)]
*  a fucking dad at the park that's crazy you see other dads at the park you say hi like it's like [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9235.939999999999s)]
*  you're not a pedophile those are my kids which are how old's your kid it's like it's normal [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9241.619999999999s)]
*  okay i've taken my kids to parks a thousand times you've never felt in some way that your masculinity [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9246.34s)]
*  inhibited your ability like your your instinct to be like nurturing and affectionate no no i think [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9253.7s)]
*  that's a weakness like if you can't be nurturing and affectionate because you think you're masculine [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9261.54s)]
*  that's crazy that's just weak that's that's nuts that's like a distortion of what strength means [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9267.54s)]
*  like that's not that's not strong that's weak like why can't you be [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9275.06s)]
*  nice like why can't you be like the idea that if you're nice and you're affectionate your kind [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9279.779999999999s)]
*  that you're weak that's crazy that's crazy especially if you have options like if you [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9284.66s)]
*  if you don't have to be nice and you're nice like that's real niceness like it's pure like [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9292.1s)]
*  you don't have to be you don't have to be a nice person but you're nice because it's a good thing [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9297.38s)]
*  to do. Like that's the right way to do it. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9302.34s)]
*  Okay, so what's so great about being a guy? [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9305.22s)]

*  And yet, like, it all comes down to trying to, like, get the attention of some lady. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9319.74s)]
*  Not at all. No. I already have the attention of a lady. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9323.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9326.86s)]
*  I still love being a guy. It's not like that's the primary motivation. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9327.86s)]
*  No? What is the primary motivation? [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9332.460000000001s)]
*  Fun! [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9334.66s)]

*  to do that's interesting. That's why I hear people say, I'm bored. Like, I don't even [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9345.18s)]
*  understand you. I don't even get it. How the fuck can you be bored? I wish I had 50 lives [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9348.34s)]
*  to live simultaneously. I would do a bunch of different things. I would have a bunch [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9352.460000000001s)]
*  of different jobs. There's so many different things that I'd love to do. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9356.3s)]
*  Aren't people sometimes beholden to doing things that they don't want to do just because [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9359.42s)]
*  they have to make bills or they have to... [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9364.9s)]
*  Yes. But that's all choices that you make, too. And unfortunately, these choices sort [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9368.3s)]
*  of, they cascade. You know, you could find yourself motivated by the wrong things and [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9374.3s)]
*  doing things for the wrong reasons, like doing things just for money and just for this or [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9382.3s)]
*  just for that. And I've done that before. I know it. But then you have to realize what [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9387.939999999999s)]
*  you're doing and... [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9391.34s)]

*  to decide what are you doing with your time? And, you know, this goes back to people commenting [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9459.86s)]
*  and bitching at people online. Well, that's what you're doing. If you're distracting yourself [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9465.9s)]
*  by doing a bunch of shit that's just worthless, and it is worthless. And easy. And easy. And [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9471.42s)]
*  very easy. Yeah. It's because you need discipline. You need to figure out what do you really [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9476.86s)]
*  want to do with your life and what makes you feel better? Do you feel like you are innately [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9482.78s)]
*  disciplined? No. No, I've learned that. Okay. I've developed that. Yeah. That's not, not [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9488.8s)]
*  no one's innately disciplined. No, I don't think that's real. I think we look at people [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9495.74s)]
*  that are disciplined like, oh, it must be easy for them. You're just born with that [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9500.26s)]
*  gene. No, that's not real. No, you recognize the value of discipline and the rewards. You [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9503.38s)]
*  reap the rewards and then you like it. And so you keep doing it. You keep pursuing it. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9510.74s)]
*  I'm just curious about like brain chemistry because when I think about, you know, you've [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9514.98s)]
*  been very complimentary towards me in this conversation, but a part of me is wondering, [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9520.3s)]
*  am I just lucky that I have the kind of internal chemistry that I have that makes me value [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9525.539999999999s)]
*  the things that I value? And, you know, I'm just doing what I feel compelled to do. And [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9531.66s)]
*  I'm curious when people feel compelled to do otherwise, and I don't know where to place [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9541.18s)]
*  responsibility for that. Do you know what I mean? Well, you wouldn't know unless you [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9550.380000000001s)]
*  are them. You could look to your own life to times where you haven't lived in an exemplary [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9555.74s)]
*  way or done things where you're helping yourself and done things, in fact, that are actually [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9563.9s)]
*  sabotaging your life and you can correct them yourself. But it's very hard. I mean, you would [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9571.9s)]
*  have to be a fucking counselor that would have ultimate truth access to a person's thought [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9577.42s)]
*  processes to really find out why they're doing things differently, why they're not living in a [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9583.02s)]
*  way. The only thing you can do is live by example. You know, there's a term for a taekwondo instructor. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9588.46s)]
*  It's called a sabam nim, and it's one who lives by example. And that's what you have to do. You [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9594.699999999999s)]
*  have to live by example. Live like someone's watching. Yes. This is what I tell people, [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9600.46s)]
*  and I've said this for years. You want to have a successful life. If you want to live your life [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9606.939999999999s)]
*  like there's a documentary crew around you filming your everyday life and that you want people to be [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9613.66s)]
*  impressed with you. Do it when no one's watching. Do it when no one's watching. I think about that [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9622.3s)]
*  when I work out. Yeah. I think about that. Yeah. If people were judging me and they were watching me [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9629.02s)]
*  right now, what would you think? Yeah. And now I'm wondering if that's one of those weird silver [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9634.46s)]
*  linings to this whole experience is that my life became very, very public very early. And so I [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9644.859999999999s)]
*  literally do have to walk around living my life as if there is potentially a documentary crew following [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9651.419999999998s)]
*  me around. Yeah, I think that is. I think that's real. I think that's the gift that I have gotten [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9658.06s)]
*  by being famous. That I have to live publicly. And if I didn't like if I was just some fucking [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9664.699999999999s)]
*  tyrant that no one knew, you know, and I just had all this wealth and power and no one knew me and [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9672.779999999999s)]
*  I could just get away with being an asshole. Right? Yeah, I think the most wealthy and the [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9679.019999999999s)]
*  most powerful do not want fame because with fame comes accountability. Yeah. But that's good. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9683.42s)]
*  That's good. Even the haters are good. You know, and then the people that defend the [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9691.18s)]
*  defend you against the haters. That's good, too. Yeah, it's all good. So everyone's just [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9697.34s)]
*  working this out together publicly. You know, and they're doing it through different vessels. And [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9701.1s)]
*  sometimes they do it through other people that do it through me and they're doing it through you. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9705.66s)]
*  Would you wish fame on anyone? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't handle it. Yeah. No, [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9708.94s)]
*  but you can handle it. But most people can't handle it. It breaks people. That's why people [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9718.220000000001s)]
*  can't have it when they're young. The worst thing you do to a child is make them famous. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9723.66s)]
*  The worst thing. I mean, look at there's countless examples. I've talked to so many of them on the [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9728.140000000001s)]
*  podcast. They're all broken. Yeah. Like who have you talked to? I'm curious. Macaulay Culkin. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9733.9s)]
*  He's doing much better now, isn't he? He's great. Yeah, he's great. I mean, he's as great as you can [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9740.14s)]
*  be to be super famous when you're six. I'm friends with Ricky Schroeder. You know, I've had a bunch [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9745.82s)]
*  of them on a bunch of people on that were famous when they were young and they all are missing [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9753.5s)]
*  something. It's like when you're making cement, you don't add enough water. There's something [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9757.5s)]
*  that happens when you have fame and adulation during your developmental stages as a child, [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9761.74s)]
*  when you're supposed to be like figuring out how do I get people to like me? Like what is it about? [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9767.42s)]
*  And there is that is that developmental stage when like your brain chemistry is being configured [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9775.02s)]
*  for the rest of your life. Like that is scary. You want to put that brain chemistry coagulation [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9781.34s)]
*  in the right configuration in the right set of circumstances or else you're going to be having [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9791.02s)]
*  a complex for the rest of your life that you're going to be grappling with. Because I don't know [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9795.02s)]
*  if you can undo the stuff that you that gets ingrained in your brain chemistry when you're [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9798.460000000001s)]
*  a kid. Like, I don't know, fuck it. I don't know anything. I don't know all about brains, [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9804.62s)]
*  but like it seems to me that like especially developmental when your brain hasn't configured [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9807.980000000001s)]
*  yet. That's when you get hardwired to have complexes the rest of your life that you're [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9815.9s)]
*  going to be dealing with. 100%. And if your brain is formulated with extreme adulation and love [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9822.06s)]
*  for no fucking reason, just because you're a cute kid, but you're a cute kid in front of the whole [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9832.06s)]
*  world in home alone. That's nuts. That's nuts. Yeah. I mean, he's a very thoughtful person, [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9836.94s)]
*  and he's come through it. I mean, I really enjoy talking to him. He's a really nice guy. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9843.66s)]
*  Does he regret being in the Home Alone movies? Boy, that's a good question. I'd have to ask him. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9847.1s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I don't know. You know, because I mean, you know, you can look back. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9852.7s)]
*  I don't even know how much of a choice that was for him. How many, how much can you choose [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9858.7s)]
*  anything when you're six? How could you choose? But like, so in a way, it was a thing that happened [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9862.78s)]
*  to him that he didn't really have control over. And does he look back on that and go, [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9868.46s)]
*  would I, would I give up that? Like, if I could get that life back, would I have a different life? [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9874.859999999999s)]
*  I'm curious what he would say. Well, he will most certainly would have a different life. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9882.3s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Would it be better? I don't know. You know, but I don't know anybody that's again, [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9886.46s)]
*  gone through that. That's air quotes whole at the end of it. You know, I just think that [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9892.3s)]
*  there's also this weird thing where you become the provider for the family, which is very [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9901.58s)]
*  strange. And then you have this parasitic relationship that your parents have to you, [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9906.14s)]
*  which is I have friends that were famous as, as young people and they have these very fucked up, [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9911.259999999998s)]
*  complicated relationships with their parents. One of my friends where they found out their parents [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9917.74s)]
*  stole from them millions of dollars. Yeah. And then you have to grapple with that as you're an adult. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9921.98s)]
*  These monsters, you know, they, they used you as an ATM machine and they stopped working and they [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9930.38s)]
*  became your quote unquote manager really just pushing you out there to try to siphon money off [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9936.22s)]
*  of you. Fucking a fucking a yeah. Yeah. But I got fame in a slow drip. I got slow doses [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9941.42s)]
*  like snake venom. You get a little bit of snake venom. You get one big bite from a cobra. You're [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9953.58s)]
*  fucked. That's what I got. Yeah. Well, you're strong, but you're strong. You came through it [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9959.34s)]
*  on the other side, a very durable person, you know, and I think there's, you know, it's a trial [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9968.62s)]
*  by fire and you went through it. I mean, you know, that's what, you know, that's what they do in [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9974.62s)]
*  bootcamp. Like, you know, you, you go through something very difficult to be strong at the end [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9980.62s)]
*  and you don't become strong, just wake up one day, I'm strong. No, you have to go through some shit, [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9985.58s)]
*  you know, and that's going through some shit when you're a kid as it becoming famous is different [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9990.86s)]
*  than going through like hardship as a child. I know a lot of children that went through hardship, [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=9997.34s)]
*  like all my friends that are interesting, all had horrible childhoods. All of them, all my most [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10002.94s)]
*  fascinating friends. I'm so grateful that I did not have a fucked up childhood. Well, that's [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10009.1s)]
*  probably what prepared you or helped you. Indeed. I feel like if I had gone through this experience [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10013.74s)]
*  after having a fucked up childhood, I would be a psychopath. Right. So thank God I had a good [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10019.5s)]
*  childhood. Yes. Yeah, I didn't have a bad childhood. I had a complex childhood, but it wasn't bad. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10026.54s)]
*  You know, my mother, my stepfather, very nice people. It wasn't bad, but it was fucked up. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10035.02s)]
*  It was moved around a lot. I had a lot of friends got bullied, a lot of different things, [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10041.980000000001s)]
*  but wasn't the worst. You know, nothing horrible happened to me. You know, so it's like [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10047.42s)]
*  the trials can't be too hard. They can't break you. They have to be just enough so that you [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10053.5s)]
*  gain some strength and you rebuild. And if they do break you, then it's a very difficult task of [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10061.74s)]
*  rebuilding and people that have gone through horrible childhood trauma, particularly abuse [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10067.66s)]
*  and sexual abuse that they have the most difficult hurdles to overcome. I agree. I think in large [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10072.460000000001s)]
*  part because how do you trust? I think rebuilding your life relies upon rebuilding yourself in the [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10080.14s)]
*  context of other human beings. And how do you do that when you can't trust anyone? It's true. But [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10089.02s)]
*  I do know some people that have gone through childhood sexual trauma that are also incredibly [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10094.779999999999s)]
*  fascinating people because they figured out a way to acquire strength through it all. But what about [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10099.58s)]
*  trust? That's the other thing I was going to say. And then they've also figured out a way to, [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10108.54s)]
*  well, they're also very skeptical people and rightly so. But that's a good thing because a [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10112.380000000001s)]
*  lot of people don't have your intentions in mind, especially if you're a woman. If you're a woman, [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10117.34s)]
*  everybody's bullshitting you to try to get in your pants. It's constant bullshitting. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10121.980000000001s)]
*  So you have to figure out who's actually bullshitting me and who's just being nice [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10126.86s)]
*  and who's being nice but kind of bullshitting, just slowly playing this game. You ever heard of [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10130.54s)]
*  the definition of a gentleman? No. It's a patient wolf. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10137.1s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. All right. And then ultimately the prey sort of acknowledges, yeah, here you are. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10143.58s)]
*  You're getting into my pants in the end, but because you've been the most patient, [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10149.58s)]
*  the most impressively patient of all. Yeah. You've done the dance correctly. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10152.94s)]
*  Put your feathers out like a good peacock. Yeah. I like that. I like that dance. Yes. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10157.98s)]
*  Well, that's the thing is like women are designed to like that dance, [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10165.74s)]
*  right? Because this person has shown you the respect of not just trying to use their physical [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10169.98s)]
*  force and take it from you and not care about you as a person. They've chosen to acknowledge [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10173.98s)]
*  you as a person and like, this is what this person wants. They want to feel comfortable with me. But [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10180.62s)]
*  then you can't be a sociopath too. It has to be genuine. You have to genuinely like this person. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10184.78s)]
*  So, you know. For a woman to feel safe. Right. How do you, you know, and then that's, [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10190.939999999999s)]
*  you got to go through a lot of trial and error with that too. You have to figure out like, [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10195.98s)]
*  why did that relationship fall apart? Oh, that was a piece of shit. Like, [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10199.339999999998s)]
*  why did that one fall apart? Oh, she was a psycho. Like recognize like, what do you actually like? Is [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10203.58s)]
*  it just that they're hot? This is the thing. Like I've had a bunch of friends that just married [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10208.699999999999s)]
*  hot people and then, you know, you're going through divorce and it's all chaos. You can't [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10212.46s)]
*  just fucking marry hot people just because they're hot and they're sexy and they turn you on. Like, [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10216.38s)]
*  that's just genes. Like you got to, you got to understand like there's a personality involved. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10222.22s)]
*  And then there's also like when you're hot, you have ultimate power. You have the Willy Wonka [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10226.539999999999s)]
*  golden ticket. Like everybody's stumbling at their feet to try to like open doors for you and be nice [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10230.619999999999s)]
*  to you and put you in prison. Open a certain kind of door. Yeah. I mean, we all have our own little [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10235.66s)]
*  burdens. Yeah. It's fucking- It's just flirting. It was flirting in the end. That's all it was. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10246.22s)]
*  Being a person is fucking weird. You know, it's really weird. It's really weird and it's temporary. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10254.22s)]
*  It's like you're always looking at that fucking hourglass, just sands running out, [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10260.22s)]
*  you know, and like, what am I doing? Why am I doing it? What's this about? What do I like? [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10265.58s)]
*  And then you can get overwhelmed with like existential angst. Just what's the point of it [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10270.46s)]
*  all? Yeah. Well, you have to find a point. You have to like, what is man's search for meaning? [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10274.62s)]
*  Like, what is it? What are we doing? Well, that's a subtitle of my book. My search for meaning. Oh [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10279.42s)]
*  my God. It is right there in cursive. If you can still read cursive. Some people can't anymore. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10287.1s)]
*  It's cursive. Is that your actual handwriting? No, I wanted it to be my actual handwriting. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10292.7s)]
*  Why didn't they use it? Fuckheads. They should have used it. They were like, this looks so much [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10296.380000000001s)]
*  more pretty. Yeah, you could have made it that pretty. I do have great handwriting. What the [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10301.18s)]
*  fuck? It's close. Might as well. It is odd. Yeah. The search for meaning. Search for meaning is very [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10306.220000000001s)]
*  odd. And you know, and you could. Especially when there's no inherent meaning. You just have to make [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10316.06s)]
*  it up. I think. I mean, it means something to you. If it means something to you, it's inherent. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10321.98s)]
*  It's real. If it means something to you, if you actually care, it means something. Like, what's [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10329.099999999999s)]
*  the point of it all? If you're going to die someday and who knows what happens when you die? And then [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10333.18s)]
*  then this, the real fatalist thing, when you die, it's over. It's just black and emptiness. And then [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10337.099999999999s)]
*  just shut off. Like, okay. So you're still alive, bitch. Okay. You got to figure out what you're [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10342.619999999999s)]
*  doing with your day to day. Do you enjoy your day to day? If not, why do some people, how come some [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10347.66s)]
*  people enjoy their life? Why don't you? Like, what does man search for meaning? Enjoy your fucking [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10352.939999999999s)]
*  life. Enjoy this life. You can. It's possible. It can be done. And I think living by example [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10357.9s)]
*  shows other people that it can be done. And then being like really honest about it. Like, what is, [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10364.779999999999s)]
*  what are the steps? What's the struggles? How do you do it? Yeah, that's actually been a really [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10369.02s)]
*  sort of fun takeaway that I've had from having just an Instagram is like, I'll post a silly video of [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10373.5s)]
*  me dancing for my kids. And a lot of the comments are just people being like, I'm so glad that [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10379.98s)]
*  someone like you can be happy. You know, it's like, God, someone like you can be happy. And I'm like, [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10387.34s)]
*  yeah, someone like me can be happy. That means you can be happy too. It's possible to be happy. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10395.58s)]
*  Yeah. But you know, when you're a 500 pound person and you want to be thin, that's a long road. It's [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10401.9s)]
*  not going to come quickly. And if you're a severely depressed, very unhappy person with a disaster of [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10410.7s)]
*  a life, it's not going to turn around overnight. That's a battleship. It takes a long time to turn [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10416.46s)]
*  that bitch around and get it facing the other direction. And the motivation has to be that you [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10423.419999999998s)]
*  have to see some kernel of opportunity embedded within that darkness because otherwise like [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10428.779999999999s)]
*  how do you even know what direction to go towards? And you have to be enjoying the process. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10437.179999999998s)]
*  You have to figure out a way to enjoy the process of improvement and to even though it's hard. Yes. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10441.42s)]
*  Yeah. And because hard can be fun. Yeah. Yeah. You have to enjoy the hard and that's why voluntary [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10447.58s)]
*  adversity is so important. You have to force yourself to do hard things so that you can do [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10454.140000000001s)]
*  hard things no matter what. If I do, what's that pump up? Pump up remixes. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10458.7s)]
*  Someone you got to get motivated somehow. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Although David Goggins [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10464.7s)]
*  doesn't listen to music because he thinks it's cheating. Really? Yeah. He gets all his motivation [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10469.66s)]
*  internal. It's like come on. External motivation is cheating. He's a fucking complete psycho. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10474.539999999999s)]
*  But he's like, I need a good soundtrack when I'm running. But that's the spectrum, [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10481.74s)]
*  you know, the spectrum of discipline, you know. That's what he's doing. That's what he's doing. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10486.7s)]
*  He's doing all day long for no goal other than like I talked to him about it. He's like, [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10494.699999999999s)]
*  I'm in the lab every day, download information. Like, whoa, dude, you're in the matrix. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10499.58s)]
*  There's a crazy video of him working out with my friend Israel Adesanya. Israel Adesanya is the [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10505.5s)]
*  former UFC middleweight champion of the world, one of the greatest fighters that ever lived. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10513.58s)]
*  And he is working out with David Goggins and he can't keep up with them. And David Goggins [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10517.099999999999s)]
*  just breaking him and he's throwing up in garbage cans and David is putting him through his workout. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10521.66s)]
*  And it's one of three workouts that David does in a day. And he's like this incredibly fit [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10526.539999999999s)]
*  world champion fighter. Is he distracting himself? [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10531.74s)]
*  I don't know. You have to talk to him. You have to dig into that brain. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10536.619999999999s)]
*  You have to dig into that. That's a very unusual brain. But he was 300 pounds and fat at one point [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10540.86s)]
*  in his time and in his life. It just has become his purpose. That's his meaning. Yeah. That makes [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10545.66s)]
*  sense to me. That's why he says he's like, he goes, I'm downloading knowledge. Like every time [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10549.9s)]
*  he's like pushing himself past the limits that he thinks he's capable of further and further. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10554.94s)]
*  He's downloading more understanding of himself. We should work out some time, by the way. I think [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10560.539999999999s)]
*  that would be fun. I only studied fighting when I first got back out of prison because I was getting [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10565.66s)]
*  a bunch of death threats. So I did prov maga. And it was a lot of it was just learning how to scream [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10572.14s)]
*  like, yeah, well, the first like my prov maga instructors, because they were instructing me [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10580.539999999999s)]
*  on a specific for a specific reason wasn't just to work out their first thing that they taught me [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10587.18s)]
*  was how to scream just to like, without without holding back the amount like I was surprised and [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10592.3s)]
*  they were telling me, people don't want to take up space and take and make noise like we're, [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10599.18s)]
*  we're taught from a very young age, especially women to not do that. And so you have to in the [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10605.74s)]
*  first, the first lesson was make noise, take up space. And, and so we just practiced like [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10611.34s)]
*  screaming as loud and as hard and as long as we could. And then once we got through that, [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10620.3s)]
*  then we started doing the fighting moves. And the first thing I had to do before I did anything [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10625.58s)]
*  was scream first, then move scream move. And so that the screaming became part of the, the movement [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10631.26s)]
*  so it would trigger so I wouldn't have to think about it. If it ever came down to it, and someone [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10638.460000000001s)]
*  actually attacked me, I wouldn't have to think scream, I would just scream. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10642.7s)]
*  Krav Maga is legit. It gets criticized a lot. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10646.300000000001s)]
*  Does it? [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10650.06s)]
*  Whatever. Yeah, by martial artists. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10650.380000000001s)]
*  Why? [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10652.7s)]
*  Well, because it's a combinatorial martial art. So it combines a bunch of different things together. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10653.42s)]
*  So it's essentially like a jack of all trades. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10659.1s)]
*  What's wrong with that? [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10661.66s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10662.54s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10663.66s)]
*  No, no, there's nothing wrong with that. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10664.300000000001s)]
*  It's like, it's like only being into purebred dogs. Like what's up with that? [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10665.82s)]
*  Well, no, it's like, is it effective? Right? Like there's no Krav Maga artists that have gone on to [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10670.140000000001s)]
*  dominate in the UFC. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10676.78s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10678.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10679.5s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10679.9s)]
*  But it kind of, you could kind of say that mixed martial arts in a sense is essentially the roots [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10680.54s)]
*  of Krav Maga, because it's taking the best aspects of various martial arts and training them. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10688.46s)]
*  Yeah. How is it different? [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10693.179999999998s)]
*  Well, the thing is, is that if you are training for self-defense, okay, you're training to defend [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10694.38s)]
*  yourself against an attacker. The true, in my personal opinion, the true best way to learn how [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10701.099999999999s)]
*  to fight is to learn how to prepare yourself for trained killers. Not the average person. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10710.06s)]
*  Really? [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10716.46s)]
*  Yes. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10716.939999999999s)]
*  Like how often are you going to encounter trained killers? [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10717.34s)]
*  It doesn't matter. You should be prepared for trained killers, because you could run into a [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10720.94s)]
*  trained killer. And if you try to do some Krav Maga nonsense on me, I'm going to fucking strangle [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10725.42s)]
*  you. You can't defend yourself against someone who actually knows how to fight. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10729.66s)]
*  Okay. Here's a question. Can I ever actually defend myself against someone like you? [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10732.78s)]
*  No, not against someone like me. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10737.66s)]
*  So then what's the fucking point? [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10739.5s)]
*  Because you could defend yourself against someone who doesn't know how to fight as good as me, [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10740.54s)]
*  but the odds of someone like me attacking you are very, very, very, very, very small. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10744.86s)]
*  But you're saying I should train to be able to fight against trained killers, but- [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10747.980000000001s)]
*  Yes. Defend yourself. Jiu-Jitsu, you can. Jiu-Jitsu, you could defend yourself. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10753.42s)]
*  The way you would be able to beat me is if I was untrained. I have too many advantages. But also, [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10762.140000000001s)]
*  I don't have advantages if someone's bigger than me and just as well-trained as me. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10767.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10772.62s)]
*  Or more well-trained than I am, better than me. I'm not going to beat the UFC heavyweight champion. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10772.94s)]
*  I'm not going to win. It's not possible. I don't care how long I do martial arts. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10781.82s)]
*  But you can avoid dying by them. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10785.1s)]
*  No. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10787.26s)]
*  No. Okay. They'll just murder you. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10787.82s)]
*  No, I can't. No. I'm completely vulnerable. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10789.1s)]
*  As an expert martial artist with three black belts, I'm completely vulnerable. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10793.74s)]
*  That's reality. That's physics. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10799.18s)]
*  That's, I mean- [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10801.34s)]
*  It's like you against an elephant who's going to win. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10802.300000000001s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. That's the 100 men versus a gorilla. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10804.54s)]
*  Yeah. Obviously, the gorilla would win. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10807.900000000001s)]
*  Not just- [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10810.460000000001s)]
*  Who ever thought the gorilla would lose? [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10810.94s)]
*  Not just retards, men, dopy men- [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10812.86s)]
*  Who have never seen a gorilla? [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10814.54s)]
*  Men who think they can fight better than they can, which is most men. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10816.380000000001s)]
*  Who ever brought up that as even a thought experiment? [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10820.62s)]
*  I don't know, but it's funny that it's like viral in 2025. I thought we would work that out in the [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10823.900000000001s)]
*  50s. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10829.26s)]
*  The fact that- [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10830.94s)]
*  I feel like people just don't remember what animals are like. We're so out of touch with animals. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10831.5s)]
*  They don't even know what an animal is. They have no idea. People know what their dog is. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10836.300000000001s)]
*  They have no idea what an animal is. An actual real animal. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10840.380000000001s)]
*  And also, your own dog could fuck you up if it wanted to. It just doesn't want to. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10843.26s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. Well, unless you have a little dog. I'll fuck up a chihuahua. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10848.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Fair. [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10852.54s)]
*  My dog, Marshall, he's a golden retriever. He's the sweetest dog on the planet. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10853.66s)]
*  He could probably kill me if he wanted. He just doesn't know. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10858.619999999999s)]
*  And he would never think to. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10862.06s)]
*  If a rat was trying to attack you, you'd be fucking terrified. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10863.82s)]
*  Or if he got infected by rabies and lost his mind. [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10866.539999999999s)]
*  It'd be a real problem. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10870.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10871.9s)]
*  Yeah. There's the reality. But if you're training to defeat a trained killer, [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10873.42s)]
*  you're going to be way better off than if you're training to defeat someone who's going to lunge [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10880.14s)]
*  at you this way. You're going to block that and hit them here and hit them there. [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10886.06s)]
*  And like. But don't you fight differently [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10890.14s)]
*  against a trained killer versus like some dude who's like drunken in a bar? [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10892.38s)]
*  The right way to fight is the right way to fight. Period. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10896.779999999999s)]
*  Whether it's some drunk dude. If some drunk dude tries to take a swing at me, [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10899.66s)]
*  I'm not going to think, oh, he's a drunk dude. I shouldn't avoid this punch. I should do something. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10903.98s)]
*  No, it's like it's all the language. So martial arts is essentially like a language. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10909.9s)]
*  And some people only know a couple of words and some people can eloquently [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10915.5s)]
*  recite Shakespeare at the drop of a hat. And that's the difference between an expert [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10919.98s)]
*  and someone who doesn't really know what they're doing. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10925.5s)]
*  And most people don't know what they're doing when it comes to martial arts. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10929.02s)]
*  If you're preparing for someone who doesn't know what they're doing, [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10932.06s)]
*  that's not the right way to do it. The right way to do it is to prepare for [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10935.82s)]
*  someone who knows what they're doing. Now, this is very different. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10938.86s)]
*  We're talking about women's self-defense versus just a grown man who is of normal size, [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10941.5s)]
*  defending himself against another grown man of normal size. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10951.58s)]
*  A fair fight. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10954.94s)]
*  Yeah, a fair fight. But in a fair fight, you should be preparing to fight against a trained killer. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10955.82s)]
*  If you are a person who just only trains in self-defense tactics, like someone comes at me, [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10961.5s)]
*  I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. Good luck doing that to someone who knows how to fight. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10968.14s)]
*  Good luck. Because they're going to recognize all of your movements in advance. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10972.3s)]
*  You're going to go like this and they're going to go, oh, well, his right arm is coming this way. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10975.82s)]
*  So I'm just going to step this way and I'm going to avoid that. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10979.9s)]
*  And I see his left foot step backwards. Well, now his right leg is vulnerable. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10983.18s)]
*  So I'm going to kick it. It's like it's language. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10987.1s)]
*  It's understanding the flow of body dynamics and movement. [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10990.46s)]
*  And it's happening so quickly that the only way that you can actually be effective is if [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10994.3s)]
*  you're fluent and you don't have to think about it. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10997.82s)]
*  You don't think about it. When you're training, it's like you very rarely think, [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=10999.66s)]
*  oh, now I'm going to do this. It's like opportunities open themselves up, especially in striking. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11004.699999999999s)]
*  Striking is something that you do where you're doing these techniques so often that as [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11010.699999999999s)]
*  things happen, you're just responding in a trained way. Your mind and your neural system [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11018.3s)]
*  is completely trained for these actions and these movements. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11025.1s)]
*  Do you think that fighting and fighting your friends, not like actual fighting for your life, [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11028.94s)]
*  but fighting for your friends is a crucial part of brain development? [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11036.300000000001s)]
*  Because I know that I've heard or at least I've read that rough housing with small kids is a [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11039.74s)]
*  really important part of their brain development and the people who become more well adapted, [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11045.18s)]
*  well adjusted emotionally, just they seem to be more fit emotionally, [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11053.42s)]
*  were kids who had some rough housing when they were young, especially with their parents. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11058.7s)]
*  Is that like an elevated form of rough housing part of a human being's cognitive development? [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11064.7s)]
*  Well, I think physical altercations are a normal part of human existence that have existed. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11071.34s)]
*  It's been going on since the beginning of time and to no understanding or no knowledge of it [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11077.74s)]
*  and no experience with it at all. I'm not a fighter. I've never gotten to a physical [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11083.9s)]
*  fight with anyone. Good. Is that good? Is that good? [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11091.9s)]
*  I haven't either other than ones on purpose. I don't get in street fights. I haven't been in [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11095.66s)]
*  a fist fight since I was a kid. They're all martial arts fights. I just think for men, [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11103.9s)]
*  being vulnerable is not good. It's just not good to not know how to defend yourself. It just [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11115.58s)]
*  leaves you with this deep insecurity. That's why you see men that don't know how to fight. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11121.66s)]
*  They use bravado and they puff their chest out and they try to intimidate people and scare people. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11126.859999999999s)]
*  It's just posturing. Maybe this is why I feel bad for men because I don't feel any sort of [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11132.3s)]
*  impulse to do that, to puff up my chest. I don't know. Maybe it's- [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11139.66s)]
*  Well, you shouldn't. Men shouldn't either. The men that do it are generally vulnerable. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11146.14s)]
*  It's bullies. Why are bullies bullies? They're bullies because they're pussies. That's really [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11152.38s)]
*  what it is. That's why they're trying to intimidate people and hurt people. It's because they're weak. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11156.38s)]
*  You train fighters or some of the nicest people. People that fight in the UFC, [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11161.66s)]
*  they're some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. It sounds crazy. My friends that are all [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11167.740000000002s)]
*  jujitsu people, they're the nicest people. They're so friendly. They're so good because they're not [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11172.94s)]
*  scared. They're not insecure. They're not vulnerable all the time. Most men who don't know how to defend [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11177.900000000001s)]
*  themselves, who are really mouthy and get loud, they're just vulnerable. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11184.38s)]
*  I have a friend and he has real rage problems and he does not fight at all. He was yelling at [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11190.859999999999s)]
*  someone in the park a lot at the comedy store once and I pulled him aside and I went, what are you [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11197.82s)]
*  doing, man? He goes, I don't know. I fucking see red. I go, you don't know how to defend yourself. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11201.099999999999s)]
*  I go, one of these days you're going to do that to someone who's like me, but they're mean. [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11206.779999999999s)]
*  They're going to just say, oh, here's a nice opportunity to just fuck this guy up. You're [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11213.179999999998s)]
*  going to wind up in a hospital or worse. Don't do this. You can't do that. Some men grow up [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11217.42s)]
*  puffing their chest out and they get away with it. They get away with it if they're loud enough, [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11224.939999999999s)]
*  or they're mean enough, or they yell enough. That becomes their defense mechanism. They get shitty [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11229.179999999998s)]

*  they get shitty with people online. They get shitty. They do get off their question. They [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11241.58s)]
*  get it out that way, but it's all just weakness. That's all it is. It's just like you're vulnerable [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11246.46s)]
*  and just don't be vulnerable. Figure out a way to not be vulnerable. I got into martial arts [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11251.5s)]
*  because I was getting bullied and I was always scared of altercations. I hate this feeling. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11257.5s)]
*  So I was like, okay, I'm going to become what I'm terrified of. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11263.82s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Okay. I guess my one sort of pokeback at that, though, is I find it interesting [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11266.54s)]
*  that you frame vulnerability in such a negative way. [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11275.580000000002s)]
*  PAUL I think the thing that I'm sort of thinking about is how it doesn't matter really how strong [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11280.460000000001s)]
*  you are or capable you are. We all are still utterly vulnerable. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11290.38s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Well, sure. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11296.14s)]
*  PAUL I guess like— [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11298.06s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK But what can you control? [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11299.58s)]
*  PAUL Fair. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11301.179999999998s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK You can control some aspect of that. You can't control guns, right? If someone [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11301.74s)]
*  has a gun, you're vulnerable. I don't care who you are. You can be Superman. Well, not Superman. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11307.339999999998s)]
*  He's bulletproof. But you can be the UFC heavyweight champion. You're so vulnerable to a gun. [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11310.859999999999s)]
*  One little kid can kill you. Bang, you're dead. Yeah. But how much can you control? [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11316.22s)]
*  You can't control some of it. So is the idea like, oh, you can't control any of it, [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11321.98s)]
*  so why control it all? Why do anything? Why be strong? [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11326.859999999999s)]
*  PAUL Well, I guess no. I guess my thing is for me, it's less about like [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11329.82s)]
*  positioning myself to not get hurt. And it's more for me, my big sort of like training that I [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11337.5s)]
*  attempt to do is how do I get up when I am inevitably hurt? So I understand that life [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11344.94s)]
*  is going to hurt me, and I don't know how life is going to hurt me. So there's like a million [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11355.34s)]
*  different ways that I can be hurt. It might be that I'm physically assaulted. It might be some [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11359.18s)]
*  other thing. And knowing that I can't prepare for all of the ways that I am vulnerable to existence, [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11363.9s)]
*  instead I try to think, okay, I am vulnerable to existence, and I am going to get hurt. How do I [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11371.18s)]
*  not be broken by the hurt? And how do I, I don't know, maybe I'm treating the inevitable pain of [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11379.18s)]
*  life as that training to get strong. I almost don't seek out pain because I've had enough pain [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11389.02s)]
*  come at me. Does that make sense? I don't know. [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11400.06s)]
*  PAUL What do you mean by seek out pain, though? [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11402.859999999999s)]
*  RISA Well, you were talking about like voluntary adversity, right? And like, to an extent, [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11404.46s)]
*  I agree with you because that's a very stoic thing to do, to seek out challenges so that you can [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11412.22s)]
*  test yourself and test your mettle and push yourself to become better for the inevitable [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11419.42s)]
*  things that might happen. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11424.779999999999s)]
*  But not even just for the inevitable things that happen, just for your own resolve, just for you [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11425.82s)]
*  as a human to achieve balance. We're all vulnerable. There's no invulnerable people. We're all going to [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11431.82s)]
*  die. We all are made of flesh and bone and we're all weak. There's no invulnerable humans. But [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11439.66s)]
*  you can be less vulnerable and you should probably optimize that, especially as a man, [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11448.3s)]
*  I think, because without it comes a lot of weird insecurities that are not comfortable [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11455.82s)]
*  and they can trip you up in all sorts of aspects of your life. [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11462.539999999999s)]
*  RISA I think maybe this is another like woman-man [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11465.58s)]
*  thing maybe where like women have to accept vulnerability as like an inescapable aspect [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11469.18s)]
*  of our lives, even just in our interpersonal relationships. Like, I know that when I walk [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11478.94s)]
*  into the room, I'm not the one who's going to win a fight, that's for sure. And so knowing that, [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11484.300000000001s)]
*  I feel like I, sure, I prepare myself in the ways that I can, right? And I'm strong in the ways that [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11493.019999999999s)]
*  I can. But like, I don't think about vulnerability in negative terms. Because I've also found that [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11504.22s)]
*  once you've been forced to reckon with your own vulnerability, that is when you [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11514.3s)]
*  find your strength. So I don't know, I see them as interchangeable. [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11521.9s)]
*  PAUL I think we're talking about different things. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11525.26s)]
*  RISA Yeah. [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11526.699999999999s)]
*  PAUL Yeah. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11527.02s)]
*  RICK Yeah, I think physical vulnerability, look, I think there's certain roles that males and females [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11527.34s)]
*  ultimately play that are unavoidable. And one of them is when your husband went downstairs to [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11537.34s)]
*  protect you. RISA Right. There's a reason why I wasn't the one who did that. [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11543.26s)]
*  Yeah. RICK Ultimately, right? In that situation, [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11547.42s)]
*  if you are less vulnerable as a man, it's a good thing. If someone breaks into my house, [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11553.18s)]
*  and they're a normal-sized person without a weapon, [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11561.18s)]
*  I'm not scared of them. I'm scared this crazy person is in my house, I'm scared that they might [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11566.380000000001s)]
*  have a weapon. But if I realize that they don't have a weapon, and they're physically threatening, [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11573.02s)]
*  I have a massive advantage. It's up to me whether or not they die. It's my choice. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11579.66s)]
*  And that's better. RISA That is better. [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11587.26s)]
*  RICK It's better than you getting beat to death by some schizophrenic who breaks into your house [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11589.1s)]
*  because you don't know how to defend yourself. And you panic and you start flailing and you [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11593.02s)]
*  hyperventilate, you don't know what to do. That's not good. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11597.5s)]
*  RISA No, it's not. RICK [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11601.58s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. I mean, we're all vulnerable. It's part of what you're doing when [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11602.86s)]
*  you're working out really hard, is to try to increase the strength and decrease the vulnerability. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11608.86s)]
*  You're trying to increase your resolve to push through difficult things, increase your character [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11616.78s)]
*  and your will. You're trying to fortify yourself. And you're also trying— [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11624.54s)]
*  RISA And that's not bad. It's all positive. It's all positive. But it gets labeled as negative [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11629.1s)]
*  because there's a lot of things that get attached to it, like jocks and bullies and assholes and [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11635.58s)]
*  aggressive men and shitty men. RISA Who then who think themselves [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11641.66s)]
*  superior to people who are more vulnerable than them. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11644.300000000001s)]
*  RICK Exactly. Instead of just being nice, because you can kill everybody in the room. Just be nice. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11647.66s)]
*  RISA Like that's the real nice person is the person who can kill everybody and he doesn't want [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11653.66s)]
*  to. You know, the really shitty people are the ones that would act on that. And sometimes you'll [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11658.94s)]
*  run into those and it's better to be prepared. That's all it is, like physical vulnerability. [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11665.42s)]
*  But what you're talking about, like psychic vulnerability and not wanting to go through [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11671.66s)]
*  pain because you've been through so much? Of course. Yeah. Look, ideally, we should go through [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11676.22s)]
*  zero pain. Ideally, we should go through zero aggression, zero shitty, deceptive, [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11681.1s)]
*  conniving, psycho people that are trying to ruin everything in your life. Ideally, yeah. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11689.02s)]
*  Ideally, you shouldn't have to prepare for that. You shouldn't interact with those people. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11695.26s)]
*  RISA And again, I'm also like speaking at [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11698.380000000001s)]
*  counter purposes with myself because I did the exact opposite thing with my prosecutor. I didn't [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11700.7s)]
*  have to talk to him. I didn't have to have a conversation with him that was difficult and [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11705.1s)]
*  awkward and hard and forced me to confront all of this pain. And I did because I knew that there [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11709.5s)]
*  was value in that. Yeah, we seek comfort always. And we avoid pain. But I don't know, maybe I'm [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11717.58s)]
*  a masochist because I always feel like there's something to gain from pain. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11729.82s)]
*  Because you've gained so much from your pain. And you kind of must know that you are who you [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11733.66s)]
*  are. You know, you're kind of an extraordinary person. And you've gone through a lot to become [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11739.34s)]
*  that person. You don't just wake up and have this perspective that you have, you have to go through [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11743.26s)]
*  a lot of shit. You know, it's fucked up, though. What I trust pain more than I trust joy. Because [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11748.06s)]
*  when I'm going through something painful, I know what that is. And I know how to confront it. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11755.82s)]
*  When I'm going through joy, I'm afraid that something bad is going to happen to me. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11762.619999999999s)]
*  That happens to people where they self sabotage. You know, I mean, I don't know, [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11768.699999999999s)]
*  I was having a great time in Perugia and then everything just went really bad out of nowhere. [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11774.699999999999s)]
*  And so like, I don't know, like a part of me is like, always is trying to see like the the yin yang [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11780.94s)]
*  of it all, like the the the good that's embedded in the bad, but then afraid of the bad that's [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11786.539999999999s)]
*  embedded in the good. Like that's, that's what and you know, and that's a reality. Like, you know, [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11791.18s)]
*  the more that you now that I have the privilege of being a mom, I know that one day, you know, [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11798.220000000001s)]

*  more pain in my life. Like if I'd never had kids, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have the opportunity to [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11809.1s)]
*  experience a potential pain that would be utterly devastating. And so like that's, [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11814.06s)]
*  that's where that play goes in my head. And I just wonder if it's a trauma response where like, [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11819.5s)]
*  I'm afraid of good things happening. I'm sure a part of it is going to be a trauma response. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11823.580000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think a lot of people that self sabotage when things start going well in their life, [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11829.02s)]
*  it's because they're used to things going badly. And this idea of things going well, this, [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11833.02s)]
*  it just scares the shit out of them. It's the unknown. And it's the pain that might come with [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11838.7s)]
*  it falling apart, the pain that might come with you, hang all your hopes and dreams on, [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11843.98s)]
*  wow, things really actually are better than they're not. And like, so you want it to fall apart so [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11849.02s)]
*  that you could achieve some level of comfort in the understanding of this state that you've been [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11856.06s)]
*  in many times before the state of failure. I need to get rid of that. I need to, I need to [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11861.98s)]
*  lose this. Yeah. But you're aware of it, which is the first step, you know, I don't think you're [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11866.539999999999s)]

*  little bit like looking over my shoulder like, who's coming at me? Imagine if you didn't. That [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11883.5s)]
*  would be crazy. After all that you've been through, imagine if you didn't think like that. [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11888.46s)]
*  It's understandable. More than understandable. You know? Yeah, that whole like, [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11893.98s)]
*  lightning doesn't strike the same place twice. And it's like, it can, I can, it can tell that [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11901.26s)]
*  to someone who's been struck by lightning. Yeah. You know, it's possible. You can't think it's [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11909.1s)]
*  the fear of the unknown and the fear of the possibilities can really cripple you. It really [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11921.02s)]
*  can. I'm trying not to let it do that to me. You're doing a great job. Thanks. You really are. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11926.22s)]
*  But again, it's, it's a struggle and this is important for people to hear. It's not like it's [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11933.42s)]
*  just like every day. Like it's, it's hard. Life is hard. Even a guy like Goggins, you know, he told [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11938.46s)]
*  me, and he goes, sometimes I stare at my fucking shoes for like 30 minutes before I put those [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11945.98s)]
*  motherfuckers on. He goes, cause he's like, I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. But he [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11949.58s)]
*  knows he's going to do this. He goes, but I put them on. I'm good on him. It's not easy. Life is [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11954.22s)]
*  not easy, but it's worth living. It's worth doing. It really is. Does he put those shoes on [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11960.699999999999s)]
*  because he knows that ultimately he's going to be glad that he did it. If you ask him, he's like, [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11969.42s)]
*  cause I'm not a bitch. Okay. Well, that's cute. That is what it is. Yeah. He's ultimately going [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11974.3s)]
*  to be glad that he's, he's still got the strength and that strength needs to be watered every day, [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11980.46s)]
*  like a garden. It's not like you just have it. Now you have it for life. No, you have to, [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11985.58s)]
*  you have to keep at it. You can, everybody could slide. Everybody could slide back. [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11992.14s)]
*  It's true. Yeah. As much as we can improve ourselves, we can. Yeah. Not, it's not easy. [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=11999.099999999999s)]
*  It's not easy being a person, but it's worth doing. Yeah. Yeah. And you can do it and everybody [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12007.42s)]
*  could do it. You could do it better than you're doing it. I could do it better than I'm doing it. [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12013.42s)]
*  I'm trying and you could do it better than we all of us. I'm so grumpy sometimes. It's like so [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12016.78s)]
*  unnecessary, unnecessary, avoidable, but it's good. It's good to, you know, struggles. Good. It's good. [[03:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12022.380000000001s)]
*  All of it's good. It's all we're on the path, you know, but this is like this, all this, this, all this, [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12029.26s)]
*  this idea that you should know better by now. That's also silly. I know 80 year old fools. [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12035.26s)]
*  Now everyone, if there's anything I've learned from being a mom, it's that everyone, every human [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12041.58s)]
*  being is a toddler. Every single person is a toddler who either hasn't gotten enough attention [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12046.62s)]
*  or hasn't had their nap, whatever the fuck. And they're just having a tantrum like that is, [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12053.26s)]
*  and if you treat everyone like a toddler, it is actually a very successful way of interacting with [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12058.86s)]
*  people. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's true. That is the lesson of parenthood, right? Yeah. I, I talk about [[03:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12066.060000000001s)]
*  that all the time that, uh, I started looking at people as like babies that grew up instead of [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12073.42s)]
*  looking at them like, Oh, this is Mike. He's 35. Like, no, Mike was a baby. Like how'd Mike become [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12079.02s)]
*  so fucked up? Oh, Mike got a lot of bad information, a lot of bad experiences. And he still is a baby. [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12083.74s)]
*  He still has the same needs that he did as a kid. They're just more sophisticated now, but ultimately [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12089.66s)]
*  they all derive down to these same things. Do you need a change of situation? Do you need some [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12096.06s)]
*  attention? Do you need to sleep on it? Like what, you know, whatever's going on, like just, [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12101.5s)]
*  if you can identify those like basic human needs and address and just tweak their circumstances, [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12107.019999999999s)]
*  you can change a person's life. And also recognize that if you ignore those basic human needs over [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12114.14s)]
*  and over, they're going to compound and you're going to have more problems. [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12119.339999999998s)]
*  And they're going to lose their shit in the middle of the grocery store. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12124.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDG6A7B7jRg&t=12128.06s)]
