*  So thanks for coming in, Michelle. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=12.0s)]
*  Thanks, Joe, for having me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=14.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=15.0s)]
*  I love your man cave. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=16.0s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=17.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=18.0s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=19.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=20.0s)]
*  So when I heard your story, I was like, this sounds completely insane. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=22.0s)]
*  And just to fill people in, just explain what happened. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, I was born into a cult, a high control group that I didn't know to call a cult because, you know, I was born there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=33.0s)]
*  You were a child. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=41.0s)]
*  That was my whole experience. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=42.0s)]
*  My grandfather started in 1931, so my mother was also born into the cult in the 1940s. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=43.0s)]
*  My dad was, let's just say he was 12 when he first met my grandfather, who would later become his father-in-law. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=50.0s)]
*  And my grandfather became his father figure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=58.0s)]
*  So my mom was married off to this man who was a follower of her father. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=61.0s)]
*  And I am the second child of their union. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=68.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=71.0s)]
*  And where did all this take place? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=73.0s)]
*  So this took place that he originally started it near LA in Pasadena, which most people know because of the Rose Parade and other things like that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=76.0s)]
*  When he first started it, it started, my understanding is he was a Boy Scout leader and he was an orphan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=84.0s)]
*  He had come from Oklahoma when he was a young man and the Boy Scouts didn't allow him to have as much control as he wanted to have of the boys. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=92.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=99.0s)]
*  So, yeah, which is a lot of control. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=100.0s)]
*  So he left the Boy Scouts and he took the boys with him and some of the boys from his original troop in 1931 stayed with him past his death. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=102.0s)]
*  One of the first boys took over after him in the late 1980s, or the early 1980s actually. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=117.0s)]
*  So he was really good at getting followers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=118.0s)]
*  What was his background? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=121.0s)]
*  Like, what did he do before he did all this? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=123.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=127.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=128.0s)]
*  He was completely, I don't think he graduated from high school. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=129.0s)]
*  I'm not 100% sure. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=131.0s)]
*  He lied about everything. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=132.0s)]
*  And he said he had a PhD from Stanford later when he got, yeah, it wasn't until I got to college that I knew this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=134.0s)]
*  I'm not even 100% sure he knew how to read, to be quite honest. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=140.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=142.0s)]
*  He came from a family where he was the only child that lived out of his particular mother who was married to a man. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=143.0s)]
*  It was a second marriage and his first wife had died and then, you know, he had a bunch of kids or whatever. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=152.0s)]
*  He had a bunch of half siblings, but no full siblings. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=157.0s)]
*  And apparently, and this could be lore too, they kind of excommunicated him. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=160.0s)]
*  He compared himself to Joseph, you know, like of the multicolored clothing and everything. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=164.0s)]
*  So he was like put down a well, he liked to say, and he escaped and he came to LA in the height of, I don't know, the silent films, things like that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=170.0s)]
*  He said he was in silent films. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=179.0s)]
*  There's no chance that is true. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=180.0s)]
*  But he said he was and he got some sort of probably church education when he got here and he declared to everyone he was the prophet of God. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=182.0s)]
*  He was going to live 500 years and he was going to lead the army of God in the second coming. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=190.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=196.0s)]
*  That's your grandpa. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=197.0s)]
*  That's my grandpa. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=198.0s)]
*  It certainly is. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=201.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=203.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=205.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=207.0s)]
*  You can't pick your grandpa. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=208.0s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=209.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=210.0s)]
*  But it was a male organization for a very long time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=211.0s)]
*  It was all men and it wasn't until. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=213.0s)]
*  All men? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=215.0s)]
*  All men. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=216.0s)]
*  It was all men. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=217.0s)]
*  It was from 1931 to 1966 when my mom married my father. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=218.0s)]
*  No one was allowed to get married there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=221.0s)]
*  And they were all presumably celibate and it was just men. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=223.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=228.0s)]
*  Presumably. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=229.0s)]
*  Presumably. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=230.0s)]
*  It's like prison. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=231.0s)]
*  They're gay for this day. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=232.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=233.0s)]
*  So I was raised by a bunch of older men who had never been with a woman. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=234.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=239.0s)]
*  I don't know how well that ended. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=240.0s)]
*  But he didn't want his daughter to be an old maid and she was getting older. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=241.0s)]
*  She was 24 by the time he married her off to my dad. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=246.0s)]
*  And at that point, I think the women, like his wife said, you know, it was their fourth child. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=249.0s)]
*  They had three boys first. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=255.0s)]
*  And so this was his first daughter. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=256.0s)]
*  And he decided that since the world had not yet ended that maybe he should marry her off before she either became an old maid or maybe a loose woman. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=258.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=266.0s)]
*  When did he think the world was going to end? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, he used to prophesy in 1977. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=269.0s)]
*  Want some more fire? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=271.0s)]
*  Sure. Love some fire. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=272.0s)]
*  I'll keep this over here if you want. It's easy to use. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=278.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=280.0s)]
*  Push that thing down. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=281.0s)]
*  Where I come from, this is a grave sin, by the way. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=282.0s)]
*  Oh, a woman smoking a cigar or anyone? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=284.0s)]
*  Anyone smoking a cigar. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=285.0s)]
*  Anyone? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=286.0s)]
*  Are you allowed to drink coffee? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=287.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=288.0s)]
*  What was the rules? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=289.0s)]
*  Well, coffee is interesting because I don't know that they said out loud you could drink coffee, but I don't remember it being forbidden. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=290.0s)]
*  The body is the temple of God and that there's no marking your body with ink, no piercing your ear. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=298.0s)]
*  I know. I have a lot of ink myself. I wasn't sure if I should show it off. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=305.0s)]
*  No piercing in the ears. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=308.0s)]
*  Right. No piercing in the ears. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=310.0s)]
*  What about makeup? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=311.0s)]
*  No makeup when I was young. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=312.0s)]
*  They also unusually cut off women's hair, at least during the era that I was there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=313.0s)]
*  Cut it off like a boy's hair? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=319.0s)]
*  Yes. My mom had the exact same haircut since she got married until she died. The exact same haircut. She died in 2022. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=321.0s)]
*  Yeah. So just a lot of the femininity was considered a temptation to the boys and since it was supposed to be, they thought it was better to, you know, burn in hell than to lust after a woman. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=329.0s)]
*  And they quoted some stuff from Paul, you know, and the apostles and the epistles and that basically you could get married as opposed to lust. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=343.0s)]
*  And so eventually in the 1960s, they allowed their first wedding, which is 35 years. Think about that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=352.0s)]
*  35 years of jealousy of all. Yeah, just a bunch of dudes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=358.0s)]
*  Wow. It is just absolutely fascinating to me how some people develop these groups. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=363.0s)]
*  And how they do it and like what the characteristics of the leaders are. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=372.0s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=377.0s)]
*  There's a place out here called the One World Theater and it used to be owned by a cult that there's a documentary on called Holy Hell. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=381.0s)]
*  And this guy had started a cult in Los Angeles. He was a yoga teacher, but he was also a gay porn star and a hypnotist. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=391.0s)]
*  It's a nice combo. It's a great combo for a documentary. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=401.0s)]
*  The documentary is incredible. You watch the documentary like what the hell. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=404.0s)]
*  And he was running from the Cult Awareness Network. So he changed his name. His original name was Jaime Gomez. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=408.0s)]
*  He changed his name. I forget what it was. He had like two different names. So I think one was Michelle and there was another one. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=415.0s)]
*  And then he came out here to Austin because right after Waco they were kind of cracking down on cults and they were trying to find... [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=423.0s)]
*  Yeah, so the Cult Awareness Network was on to him. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=430.0s)]
*  Because also family members were calling in, hey we lost our children. They're with this guy and he's crazy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=434.0s)]
*  And you know they've got the people in the woods in LA. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=440.0s)]
*  So he moved out to Austin and had his followers build him this theater where he could dance in front of them. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=443.0s)]
*  Is he a good dancer? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=450.0s)]
*  He was a very handsome guy and he was very charismatic and he was like ripped. He was a yoga instructor. He had a six pack. He was a beautiful man. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=452.0s)]
*  And I think he also was kind of exotic looking. So he had this guru thing going on. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=460.0s)]
*  And then he was also a hypnotist. So he was really good at manipulating people's consciousness. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=469.0s)]
*  That might be a criteria for being a cult leader by the way. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=474.0s)]
*  Charismatic? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=478.0s)]
*  Maybe a form of hypnotist. You have to be able to manipulate consciousness. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=479.0s)]
*  Because if people, at least your top leaders have to be indoctrinated. If they are not... [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=484.0s)]
*  I mean some people call it brainwashing. You can call it what you want. But you have to have people who worship you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=489.0s)]
*  It doesn't work unless you do. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=495.0s)]
*  Of course. I think we have a very narrow idea of what hypnotism is because of the term. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=497.0s)]
*  I think the term, you lock on the term like, oh I want to quit smoking. I'll go to a hypnotist. And they set you in the clock. Tick tock tick tock. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=504.0s)]
*  But I think there's like states of mind melding that happen with people where you all get sort of locked into a state of consciousness. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=511.0s)]
*  And I think it happens in riots. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=519.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=522.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like the madness of the crowds. There's something real about that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=523.0s)]
*  If you've ever been in a chaotic public environment where like fights break out or something like that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=528.0s)]
*  There's a very strange feeling in the air that leads people to do things that they would never do before. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=534.0s)]
*  People that would never pick up a shopping cart and throw it through a Starbucks window. We'll do that now. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=540.0s)]
*  It's like everybody just loses their fucking mind. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=544.0s)]
*  And I think it happens in concerts when people are like jamming out together. You all get in the same like mind frequency. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=547.0s)]
*  And I think a really good cult leader does that too. I think they get these people and they lock them into this way of thinking. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=554.0s)]
*  And we're you know we don't want to call it hypnotism. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=561.0s)]
*  But I think there's a lot of states that are very similar to hypnotism in that something happens where you enter into an altered state of consciousness. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=565.0s)]
*  That's probably accessible somehow or another. But you don't know how to get there. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=574.0s)]
*  But then this song brings you there or this person brings you there with their talk about the impending apocalypse and we're all locked in. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=578.0s)]
*  You know and it gives people like a sense of belonging and purpose that you're locked into this frequency that everybody else in the room is locked into. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=587.0s)]
*  It's very comforting. I mean there are a lot of things about a cult that are very comforting. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=595.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's the positive benefit of religion. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=598.0s)]
*  Absolutely. You know it's like this this thing comforts you. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=604.0s)]
*  And even if even if like it's like some of them's got to be wrong. Someone's got to be wrong. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=607.0s)]
*  Or if you have a hundred different ones and they're all different gods and different people somebody's got to be wrong. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=612.0s)]
*  But the one common denominator that they share is that if you do believe in these things it seems to aid you in life. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=617.0s)]
*  People seem to be happier. They seem to have more of a sense of purpose. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=624.0s)]
*  They don't feel lost. You know some of the least happy people I know are atheists. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=629.0s)]
*  And it's I have a joke about it where I say you're really dumb for not believing in stupid shit because if you believed in stupid shit if you believed in dumb shit you'd be happier. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=634.0s)]
*  That would be a smarter move because it's kind of true. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=645.0s)]
*  And I think that's what's so fascinating to me about these cults is how they do it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=648.0s)]
*  How they lock people in. I mean I'm sure because of your experience you've probably seen a few of these documentaries right. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=653.0s)]
*  You've probably seen. I definitely have. And you know when I watched the reenactment of the Waco one which is not the documentary but the did you read or watch the one that came out maybe five years ago. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=659.0s)]
*  No no. But they showed you know the children and how they didn't want to leave you know they and just how difficult there was a child psychologist who worked with them afterwards. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=668.0s)]
*  And I was very interested in that because it takes a long time to undo the level of I mean it's one thing to have a faith right. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=679.0s)]
*  Like believing in you can call it stupid shit but whatever you believe in it's one thing to have a faith but to not have the ability to think for yourself and that to be trained out of you. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=687.0s)]
*  So I went to lunch a couple of days ago with someone I hadn't seen since I was three and he so a lot of fellow former field members have come out of the woodwork since we should tell her right field is the name of the group. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=696.0s)]
*  Yes we call ourselves the fields and one of these former members who I won't name I hadn't seen I didn't I didn't recognize him at all. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=708.0s)]
*  I just hadn't seen since I was a little kid but several of them have come out who knew my parents and of course knew my grandfather before I was born and then maybe knew me when I was a little teeny girl and they have lots of stories. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=717.0s)]
*  Anyway he was on one of these things we called the trip with a capital T and what we did on the trip. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=728.0s)]
*  I mean there were different things in different years but this one was in the early 1970s and he was you know doing all the things you do on the trip but one thing they required was my father required of us at home to is to run every morning first thing in the morning which you can say there's some good things about this but you slept together intense and then you'd get up and you'd run and you'd have to beat your time and my father used to time us as a kid so like I had to beat my time every day which is really hard to do of course because at some point you're not going to be able to beat your time right like you can't always get better. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=734.0s)]
*  But at this point he was 19 and he was beating the time he said in that time was it in relation to the fastest runner and so if the fastest guy was going really fast you had to keep the same ratio of distance. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=763.0s)]
*  So anyway he didn't make his time there were three guys who didn't make their time and they had to go through the swap machine. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=777.0s)]
*  So my grandpa often made boys go through the swap machine and the simple version which was done at the actual location of the field was you'd crawl through men's the other boys or men's legs and every boy would spank you. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=782.0s)]
*  I know I know. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=793.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=795.0s)]
*  I know they're little. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=797.0s)]
*  Well we won't even get into all the things you can think about that but there was a different version that was only done when the boys were separated from their parents and so when they would go on these trips and my dad was the original driver. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=798.0s)]
*  He started driving by the time he was 18 he was driving all around the country taking my grandfather's boys. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=808.0s)]
*  So again my father was not his son he was just some dude who like you know joined to this cult and my father would drive these boys around and he would time them when they ran and did all those things. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=813.0s)]
*  And so in this particular case they did swap machine where you have to hold on to a fence pole and you face the fence and then all the guys come and they hit you. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=823.0s)]
*  So they're not just spanking you but they're hitting you. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=831.0s)]
*  And so he's getting kidney punches and all this stuff and he was saying he fell to his knees and he was he was he almost died. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=834.0s)]
*  He was so bruised up and and he he was he did not want anyone to know this story. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=840.0s)]
*  He hasn't spoken of it because he's so ashamed that potentially someone might think why didn't you fight back. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=847.0s)]
*  And of course I said you were trained not to you trained that you deserved this you know. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=853.0s)]
*  And then apparently one of my uncles you know was really worried when to take him to hospital but couldn't or didn't because they had no insurance. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=859.0s)]
*  And this young man who's no longer a young man said that you know he could never tell his parents. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=867.0s)]
*  And he never to this day ever told his parents or anyone he and his brother have never spoken of their time in the fields. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=873.0s)]
*  It is like this big taboo. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=880.0s)]
*  He got out maybe a year later but he was I mean that was only one of many many many stories he told me but that one just really struck me to feel ashamed of that. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=883.0s)]
*  You know like I I guess for many years I too did not tell people where I came from because you feel like you must have done something weak to be a follower. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=891.0s)]
*  And that's just not true. I mean if if someone gets a hold of you as a child they can program you to think almost anything especially if they're good at it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=902.0s)]
*  Yeah unquestionably. I mean that's why they have child suicide bombers. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=910.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=914.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean you can trick children. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=915.0s)]
*  It's it's understandable though that you would think somehow or another that other people would think that it's your fault or ignorant people would think why didn't you know why didn't you leave you know or people that you know never really thought about it never thought it through because they haven't had to. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=919.0s)]
*  The friends I went out with who I mean I'm calling them friends now but I haven't seen them since I was a little girl. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=934.0s)]
*  They were saying I would have of course you would drink the Kool-Aid and when people use that expression I would have been first in line with sign up for that. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=939.0s)]
*  I mean that's we all would have and I mean that and I was I was born there and indoctrinated and I would have completely taken anything that my grandfather or my parents told me was going to kill me. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=945.0s)]
*  I would have you know I would have felt that that was going to take me to heaven quicker and everyone I knew would have done that. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=956.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=962.0s)]
*  And the reason you don't hear about a lot of cults by the way is because they didn't end up in flames or mass suicide. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=963.0s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that they didn't prey on you know dozens sometimes hundreds or even thousands of people depending on the cult. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=969.0s)]
*  I was talking to Mark Andreessen he was explaining to me that there's still many many active cults in California. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=978.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=984.0s)]
*  And I was like what like right now like people know about them. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=985.0s)]
*  Oh yeah they're they're successful like there's some successful cults. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=988.0s)]
*  Yeah when I first is the field still around the field still around. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=993.0s)]
*  I've been told it is a completely different organization and I'm not going to vouch one way or the other. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=996.0s)]
*  They certainly don't have a charismatic leader like my grandfather once he died and his replacement was there and then once he died I think it's become it has not become secular. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1001.0s)]
*  It's a very strong religious organization but they don't have the control they used to because like when we were young we didn't have Social Security number. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1012.0s)]
*  There was no way to track things and now you know it's hard to get away with. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1017.0s)]
*  You have to pay taxes. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1022.0s)]
*  Yes they do pay taxes and there was a sexual abuse you know case that was actually prosecuted and I think after that which I think was 2006 I think that they had to really clean up a lot of their practices. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1023.0s)]
*  When I'm hearing these stories about these boys and the abuse that's what I'm thinking about. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1035.0s)]
*  I don't think if there's a bunch of boys and no one's allowed to get married that's not a good recipe. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1040.0s)]
*  No it's not and the particular one that got prosecuted was a young leader who was abusing 11 and 12 year old boys sexually. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1046.0s)]
*  I say out loud I said this to my mom I said mom isn't it curious that no one's ever prosecuted anyone for what they did to girls and I was a sexual abuse victim there and I it was something I was so ashamed of for so long and anyway but there's other forms of abuse. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1054.0s)]
*  That go on I mean there's obviously physical abuse but there's a lot of psychological abuse there's a lot of ways that gets inside of you that you're worthless and that you can't trust yourself and you can't even trust yourself with your own stories. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1070.0s)]
*  And I have a slightly younger brother who adores you by the way. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1081.0s)]
*  Thomas said what's up. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1085.0s)]
*  What's his name. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1087.0s)]
*  His name's Michael. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1088.0s)]
*  What's up Michael. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1089.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1090.0s)]
*  He I love him to death and he was raised you know we were all raised collectively but we were also raised separate from each other and my biological siblings we all had different experiences. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1091.0s)]
*  Because they don't let you bond. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1099.0s)]
*  They don't they don't want my sister who's just a little bit younger. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1101.0s)]
*  She and I we loved each other deeply but we weren't allowed to speak to each other sometimes for weeks or months at a time. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1104.0s)]
*  And they were just strongly against you forming what they would call allies. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1109.0s)]
*  They didn't want friendships that could turn into anything that would be a little bit. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1114.0s)]
*  Probably Colty but no like anything that would form a clique they used to call it right. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1118.0s)]
*  Any other groups where another person could be in control right. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1126.0s)]
*  Or they could discuss who's in control. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1130.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1132.0s)]
*  Or any loyalty to anyone else other than the primary leader. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1133.0s)]
*  There's a lot of ways that this that you can indoctrinate people and make them police themselves. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1137.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1143.0s)]
*  That's what North Korea does. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1144.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1145.0s)]
*  North Korea gets everybody to rat on everybody else. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1146.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1148.0s)]
*  That was huge where I come from. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1149.0s)]
*  I have. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1150.0s)]
*  I felt like it was a huge compliment. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1151.0s)]
*  One of the former members came out of the woodworks after this and he said you know I knew that you would never rat us out. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1154.0s)]
*  And I was like man that's so great. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1159.0s)]
*  But I mean it was something we were all taught so so so deeply. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1161.0s)]
*  That yeah you you have to no matter if this is your brother or your sister or your mom you have to tell on them. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1164.0s)]
*  You have to. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1171.0s)]
*  Because you're worse. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1172.0s)]
*  And that just keeps everybody scared all the time. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1173.0s)]
*  You never trust anyone. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1175.0s)]
*  God that's so it's so insidious and yet also brilliant. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1176.0s)]
*  Like it's evil. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1182.0s)]
*  It's evil. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1183.0s)]
*  But it's how did he figure out how to do it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1184.0s)]
*  That's it's crazy. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1186.0s)]
*  And how is he able to pull it off. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1187.0s)]
*  That's what's always so fascinating to me that it's not like children with children. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1189.0s)]
*  It just makes 100 percent sense. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1194.0s)]
*  You're raised there. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1196.0s)]
*  You think this is reality and you think that the world outside reality is all a bunch of evil demons or whatever it is. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1197.0s)]
*  But if you're an adult like you're a grown adult thirty four year old man and you meet this dude at the auto repair shop and he hands you a pamphlet. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1204.0s)]
*  And the next thing you know you're on a farm somewhere like how do those people. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1211.0s)]
*  So I can't vouch to that. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1216.0s)]
*  I will say that the unusual thing about the field is you have to join as a child. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1217.0s)]
*  There are no adults who join you. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1221.0s)]
*  They really it's kind of like a pyramid scheme when you're most people join when they're five or six and they are indoctrinated and then they play sports like. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1223.0s)]
*  So for example they play tackle football at age five. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1232.0s)]
*  And so they teach everyone how to you know play game. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1234.0s)]
*  But it's only the people who are really good at the game that they continue to court. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1240.0s)]
*  I would say you could call them groom whatever. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1244.0s)]
*  But it's there's a lot more kids there than will ever get into the inner circles. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1247.0s)]
*  And it's a little like the mob or something like I was born in the inner circle. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1253.0s)]
*  But there are plenty of people who came out of that cult who honestly weren't harmed by it because they got out young. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1256.0s)]
*  So as long as you get out by the age of 12 you're probably OK. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1262.0s)]
*  But they don't keep you unless you're really fully indoctrinated. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1266.0s)]
*  And most of the people who stay really don't have a family to go back to. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1269.0s)]
*  And they separate you from your family. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1272.0s)]
*  And so they do more and more separation as you become a teenager. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1273.0s)]
*  By the time you're 18 you're signing a commitment for life form. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1276.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1279.0s)]
*  And I'm not saying that's happening now but that was 100 percent happened not during my not just during my era but all the decades prior to me. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1280.0s)]
*  So it's not just a cult but it's like it's got a sort of a meritocracy built into it. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1287.0s)]
*  Yeah but I think a lot of cults have that. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1292.0s)]
*  Really. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1294.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1295.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1296.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1297.0s)]
*  I mean you have to have something to strive for. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1298.0s)]
*  But they kick people out that don't line up enough. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1299.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1301.0s)]
*  So cults in general kick people out. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1302.0s)]
*  In fact they want you to believe that staying is hard and that you have to work hard to stay. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1304.0s)]
*  I think the misconception is that they're trying to get you in. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1309.0s)]
*  Sure they're seducing you in some way. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1312.0s)]
*  There's some sort of calling card whether it's a pamphlet or something else. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1313.0s)]
*  Yoga class. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1316.0s)]
*  Do I have what? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1317.0s)]
*  No I said yoga class. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1318.0s)]
*  Yeah exactly. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1319.0s)]
*  That's what that guy did. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1320.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1321.0s)]
*  Dancing you know. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1322.0s)]
*  It brings you in but then after that it's like you're the strong one. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1323.0s)]
*  You're the special one for choosing to stay. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1326.0s)]
*  In this particular cult they always would say there's 20 of you in this room. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1329.0s)]
*  19 of you will fall away. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1333.0s)]
*  There's only one of you. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1334.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1335.0s)]
*  Who will make it into the army of God. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1336.0s)]
*  Geez. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1338.0s)]
*  It's like the Navy Seals of cults. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1339.0s)]
*  It kind of is. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1341.0s)]
*  And there is a lot of physical. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1342.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1345.0s)]
*  They only want the best of the best. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1346.0s)]
*  So if you were a child and you're in, I mean first of all how could anybody ever expect [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1349.0s)]
*  a child who gets indoctrinated into that to know the difference? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1356.0s)]
*  If that's your reality and that's what you grow up with, how could you possibly know? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1361.0s)]
*  What year are we talking about when you were like eight years old? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1366.0s)]
*  That would have been the early eight, late 70s. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1370.0s)]
*  Yeah so nobody knows what the hell's going on. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1374.0s)]
*  Oh absolutely not. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1376.0s)]
*  Even in the world. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1377.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1378.0s)]
*  The whole thing's a big foggy haze. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1379.0s)]
*  There's no internet. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1381.0s)]
*  The world's, we have like one tenth of access to information that we do today. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1382.0s)]
*  Oh yes probably. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1387.0s)]
*  And you're also a child and you think that this is reality. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1388.0s)]
*  And parents were used to their kids being gone all the time and I think that that was [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1390.0s)]
*  not something unusual because one thing I hear for kids who went there, people say well [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1394.0s)]
*  how did your parents allow that? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1398.0s)]
*  And I mean parents like they sent them off to the sports place and then their kid got [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1400.0s)]
*  really into it and then at some point their kid became a teenager and didn't want to come [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1403.0s)]
*  home anymore. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1406.0s)]
*  And they're like well I don't think my kid's doing drugs or I don't think that they're [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1407.0s)]
*  like in prison so it seems like they're doing pretty well. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1410.0s)]
*  But it also seems like societally there was a shift at some point in time where, what [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1412.0s)]
*  was the year where more women entered the workforce and more women started getting jobs? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1418.0s)]
*  So that happened in the 70s. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1426.0s)]
*  I think 1973 might have been like one of those, I mean it obviously was starting to happen [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1428.0s)]
*  in the 60s but there was a lot of women at home in the 60s. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1432.0s)]
*  Around 1973 to 1979 you had a huge exodus of women out of the home. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1435.0s)]
*  The women I come from, I mean like my grandmother who had my father who joined the cult, she [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1442.0s)]
*  was always a working woman, minimum wage working woman, she didn't have more than eighth grade [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1449.0s)]
*  education. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1452.0s)]
*  She worked because her father, excuse me, my dad's father, her husband had been in World [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1453.0s)]
*  War II and got pretty severe PTSD or whatever, was an alcoholic and beat her. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1459.0s)]
*  And so she ran away from him. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1464.0s)]
*  She just had one child which was my father. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1465.0s)]
*  She was living in Chicken Coop near LA just with this one son and she was the first woman [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1468.0s)]
*  to get hired in a factory but this was in the 1940s. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1472.0s)]
*  So there were always women of course and lots of women of color who were working but it [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1475.0s)]
*  wasn't the middle class women who were working. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1478.0s)]
*  But the poor women were always working. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1481.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1483.0s)]
*  I'm just thinking like latch key kids at that point back then. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1484.0s)]
*  70s and even 80s. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1488.0s)]
*  Yeah it was totally common. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1489.0s)]
*  All my friends, we just got let out of the house when we were kids. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1491.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1494.0s)]
*  You just got on the bus, went to school, walked home from school, rode the bus, hung out with [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1495.0s)]
*  your friends, nobody knew where you were. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1499.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1501.0s)]
*  So you could have been in a cult and your parents would have not necessarily known. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1502.0s)]
*  I think I would have told them. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1504.0s)]
*  Well. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1506.0s)]
*  But I could have got sucked into one. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1507.0s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1509.0s)]
*  It's like everybody looks at themselves as who they are today. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1510.0s)]
*  So if you're a 35 year old man and you're listening to this today, you're like, I wouldn't [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1513.0s)]
*  get sucked into that. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1518.0s)]
*  That you can't say that because you're not a five year old boy. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1519.0s)]
*  If you're a five year old boy, you don't know what the fuck is going on. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1522.0s)]
*  You're a child. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1525.0s)]
*  By the time you're 18, you sort of get a, especially if you're a little streetwise, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1526.0s)]
*  like, all right, some people are shady. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1530.0s)]
*  I know what the fuck's going on. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1532.0s)]
*  Listen to this guy. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1533.0s)]
*  He's trying to rope me in. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1534.0s)]
*  I remember there was this Christian group when I was in college that was trying to indoctrinate [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1536.0s)]
*  people and they were they were like young, good looking people. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1541.0s)]
*  And there was this this beautiful Puerto Rican girl and she was always trying to get me to [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1547.0s)]
*  go to parties with her. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1553.0s)]
*  And I was like, wow, did I hit that jackpot? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1555.0s)]
*  Like, eventually I'm going to get a date with this girl. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1558.0s)]
*  Like, this is amazing. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1561.0s)]
*  You know, I was probably 1920, I guess, 20, 21 maybe. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1562.0s)]
*  And one day she invites me to go to this retreat on the weekend. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1566.0s)]
*  Like, they have some some crazy Christian retreat. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1573.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, my God, a retreat like that. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1576.0s)]
*  She's not telling me it's a Christian retreat. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1579.0s)]
*  She's telling me it's like this fun party and this whole thing. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1581.0s)]
*  And I said, I can't I have plans this weekend. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1584.0s)]
*  I go. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1587.0s)]
*  But if you guys ever do another one of those things, that sounds like fun. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1588.0s)]
*  And so Monday morning or whatever the day was, I'm in school and we're all in the cafeteria. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1591.0s)]
*  It was the day that Trump's airplane, the landing gear, failed to open. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1597.0s)]
*  And so we all sit down at the lunch table and I just seen it on the news. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1604.0s)]
*  I said, did you see this thing on the news about the plane? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1610.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1612.0s)]
*  Like, the landing gear didn't didn't go out. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1613.0s)]
*  And so the plane just on the belly of the plane skid across the runway. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1616.0s)]
*  And there's all these crazy sparks. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1620.0s)]
*  And I go, but nobody died. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1622.0s)]
*  And they go, oh, praise God. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1624.0s)]
*  Praise God. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1626.0s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1627.0s)]
*  Like, what's going on here? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1628.0s)]
*  This super hot Puerto Rican girl's like, oh, praise God. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1630.0s)]
*  They're all praise God. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1632.0s)]
*  Praise God. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1633.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, and then it just immediately click. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1634.0s)]
*  You dummy. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1638.0s)]
*  They were trying to get you to go to their church thing. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1639.0s)]
*  You thought she liked you. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1642.0s)]
*  And then they started talking to me more about God. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1644.0s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, I got to go. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1646.0s)]
*  I got a class. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1648.0s)]
*  I got to get out of here. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1649.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1650.0s)]
*  So you didn't get that date? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1651.0s)]
*  No. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1652.0s)]
*  I avoided them. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1653.0s)]
*  They were in my Italian class and they were learning how to speak Italian. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1654.0s)]
*  And I avoided them. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1658.0s)]
*  I was like, I can't. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1659.0s)]
*  I can't be. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1660.0s)]
*  I can't. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1661.0s)]
*  I can't be involved in this because they were all glossy. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1662.0s)]
*  They were like they were all believers. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1664.0s)]
*  Not this is not saying that God's not real. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1667.0s)]
*  This is not saying that Christianity is not true. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1669.0s)]
*  That's not what I'm saying. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1671.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is you could have got those people with Scientology. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1672.0s)]
*  You could have got those people with Mormonism. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1675.0s)]
*  You could have got those people with the Moonies. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1678.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1680.0s)]
*  They were just looking for a thing that they could attach themselves to and then formulate their identity based around this thing. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1681.0s)]
*  And for them, it was Christianity. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1688.0s)]
*  And it was this youthful form of Christianity where they're trying to get young people. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1691.0s)]
*  They're making it like retreats. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1695.0s)]
*  We're going to party. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1697.0s)]
*  And they were all socially odd. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1698.0s)]
*  They were all real awkward people. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1700.0s)]
*  It was really it was very interesting, though, to me. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1702.0s)]
*  The person is always curious about human beings. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1705.0s)]
*  I was like, this is wild. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1707.0s)]
*  I'm hanging around. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1708.0s)]
*  Well, I think in high control groups, they do tend to obviously cater to the young. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1710.0s)]
*  I mean, they're soliciting the young. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1714.0s)]
*  And I want to be clear, too. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1716.0s)]
*  I'm not anti-religion. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1718.0s)]
*  I think high control groups slash cults are a whole different experience. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1719.0s)]
*  And yes, they use religion, but they don't teach you to have faith and to trust yourself in your faith. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1724.0s)]
*  They teach you to follow someone else's faith. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1728.0s)]
*  I used to have a joke about what's the difference between a cult and a religion. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1730.0s)]
*  Where a cult is created by one guy and he knows it's bullshit. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1733.0s)]
*  In a religion, that guy's dead. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1737.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1740.0s)]
*  And all the other people, all the other people that this fucking dude two thousand years ago convinced. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1741.0s)]
*  But some religions are really beneficial and they might, in fact, be based on some kind of true story. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1748.0s)]
*  I think it's a game of telephone. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1754.0s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1756.0s)]
*  I think if you tell me a story and I tell Jamie the story and then Jamie tells someone out in the lobby a story, by the time it gets to me all the way again, it's going to be screwing up. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1757.0s)]
*  Now imagine this over thousands of years of just oral tradition and then writing in lost languages like ancient Hebrew. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1766.0s)]
*  They wrote them in Aramaic on animal skins. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1776.0s)]
*  Some of these stories like the Dead Sea Scrolls. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1779.0s)]
*  And then they eventually translate them to Latin and to Greek and to Roman and to English and to German. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1781.0s)]
*  What? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1787.0s)]
*  Lost in translation. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1789.0s)]
*  Also, like, what did they know? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1790.0s)]
*  How much did they know? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1793.0s)]
*  They had some ideas of like the formation of the universe. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1794.0s)]
*  The beginning there was light. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1797.0s)]
*  It sounds a lot like the Big Bang. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1798.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1800.0s)]
*  Sounds a lot like if you would tell the Big Bang to your kids and your kids would tell to their kids and you're going to do this for a thousand years. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1801.0s)]
*  At the end of it, you're going to get some real people are gross. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1807.0s)]
*  They always like to like twist things around and make things. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1811.0s)]
*  You know, they add their own little spice to a story. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1815.0s)]
*  Like, if you ever have a friend that tells a story, hey, bro, that didn't happen that way. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1818.0s)]
*  Like, you didn't say that. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1821.0s)]
*  You fucking ran for cover. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1822.0s)]
*  Like, everybody's got their own version of a story. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1824.0s)]
*  Well, if you got oral traditions, 100 percent for sure, you're going to have a lot of that, especially when you have high control groups like your grandfather. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1826.0s)]
*  Your grandfather. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1836.0s)]
*  The translations to like we even when the monks were translating all that and like sometimes like they were scribes and they were inscribing it. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1837.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1844.0s)]
*  Like all of that, too. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1845.0s)]
*  There was an agenda on a lot of that. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1846.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1848.0s)]
*  And so, yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1849.0s)]
*  And then when we read the King James version of the Bible, I mean, you know, the king pronounced it to be so. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1850.0s)]
*  And so any anything that was left out, I mean, it was a lot left out. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1854.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1859.0s)]
*  And what was canonized because it was perhaps dangerous to the particular regime that he was running. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1860.0s)]
*  And so not to say that there's not to decide. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1865.0s)]
*  Yes, I know you get to decide what God meant. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1868.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think God didn't mean any of that. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1871.0s)]
*  Take that stuff out. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1874.0s)]
*  My question. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1875.0s)]
*  My problem is never with religion. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1876.0s)]
*  My problem is purely with human nature and what we know about humans. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1879.0s)]
*  If there was a way that you got religion through some sort of nonhuman source, like if you achieved your experience through a nonhuman source, I would go, OK, well, maybe there's a place that you can go and you could actually go meet God. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1883.0s)]
*  There's like a portal you walk through. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1897.0s)]
*  But as soon as you're doing you're letting people tell you a story, people are full of shit. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1900.0s)]
*  They just generally, generally, at least a certain percentage are full of shit. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1907.0s)]
*  And the people that want to control people have a much higher likelihood of being full of shit because they really do that correctly. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1913.0s)]
*  Like, if you want to be a president, like, you got to lie. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1920.0s)]
*  You got to lie. It's like really important. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1923.0s)]
*  So the people that are like good at that job are generally full of shit. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1925.0s)]
*  And so then you have a problem with the interpretation of the past. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1930.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1934.0s)]
*  You're seeing that right now in universities. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1935.0s)]
*  People are trying to reinterpret certain events because of the way people feel about socio political issues today. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1937.0s)]
*  So they're trying to reinterpret history, take down statues. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1944.0s)]
*  There's a lot of craziness that's going on today. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1947.0s)]
*  Well, that's like a microcosm of the ancient history of human beings. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1950.0s)]
*  It's not that God's not real. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1954.0s)]
*  It's that people are full of shit. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1957.0s)]
*  And so there's some a lot of wisdom in a lot of these ancient religious texts in particular, which is really fascinating. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1959.0s)]
*  Like, how much did they know about the human experience? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1967.0s)]
*  How much did they know about how you need to live your life in order to be harmonious with the universe? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1970.0s)]
*  How do you how do you know that you're going to be harmonious with the universe? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1976.0s)]
*  How do you how do you like how do you accentuate positive experiences? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1979.0s)]
*  How you leave the world a little bit better than it was before you got here? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1983.0s)]
*  And that's universal. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1986.0s)]
*  Have you read the whole Bible, by the way? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1988.0s)]
*  I did when I was a kid. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1989.0s)]
*  I actually had Bible class in Florida. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1991.0s)]
*  When I moved from when I moved from San Francisco to Florida, I was 11 years old. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=1994.0s)]
*  And it was a completely polar opposite experience of the country. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2001.0s)]
*  I lived in San Francisco with two parents who were hippies in Haight-Ashbury. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2006.0s)]
*  So we were in the middle of like we lived near Lombard Street. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2012.0s)]
*  We were in the middle of like the hippie antiwar revolution of the 1960s. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2016.0s)]
*  And then I moved to Gainesville, Florida. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2022.0s)]
*  My stepdad was going to he was becoming an architect. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2025.0s)]
*  He was a computer programmer. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2029.0s)]
*  And then he switched careers, became an architect. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2030.0s)]
*  And so he's going to the University of Florida, Gainesville. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2032.0s)]
*  And so we were there. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2035.0s)]
*  So now I'm around alligators, there's fucking alligators everywhere. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2037.0s)]
*  It was like, what are you people retarded? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2041.0s)]
*  Why do you have giant monsters everywhere? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2044.0s)]
*  This is so ridiculous. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2046.0s)]
*  So we had alligators, super weird swampy weather and religion. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2048.0s)]
*  Religion was in the schools. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2054.0s)]
*  Like in public school, you had Bible class and they also paddled you. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2056.0s)]
*  It was the first time I'd ever been hit by a teacher. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2061.0s)]
*  I got in this fist fight with this kid and they whacked us with a paddle. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2064.0s)]
*  Can I ask you an allegorical question? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2068.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2070.0s)]
*  So when you were in Florida in the 1970s, were you there in the late 1970s? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2071.0s)]
*  It was, let me see. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2074.0s)]
*  So I was in 67. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2076.0s)]
*  I was born. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2078.0s)]
*  So I in 73, I was in San Francisco. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2079.0s)]
*  So 75, 76. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2083.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2085.0s)]
*  Did you know someone whose name is Ross Allen in Florida? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2086.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2089.0s)]
*  I was 11. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2090.0s)]
*  Well, he was older. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2091.0s)]
*  He was an alligator. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2092.0s)]
*  He's an alligator wrestler. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2095.0s)]
*  He had an alligator farm. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2096.0s)]
*  Alligator wrestlers? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2098.0s)]
*  What's the lifespan of those fellas? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2099.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know when he died. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2103.0s)]
*  That doesn't seem like that would work out so well. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2105.0s)]
*  Well, they probably fanged him. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2110.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2111.0s)]
*  Even that, they're just going to break your arms off. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2112.0s)]
*  Speaking of which, I need more fire. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2114.0s)]
*  Grab that sucker right there and pull the top back. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2116.0s)]
*  Flip it around the other side. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2119.0s)]
*  Like this? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2120.0s)]
*  This way? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2121.0s)]
*  This way? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2122.0s)]
*  This way? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2123.0s)]
*  The other way? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2124.0s)]
*  No, the other way. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2125.0s)]
*  It's upside down. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2126.0s)]
*  See this? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2127.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2128.0s)]
*  Now see the top? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2129.0s)]
*  Pull the sucker back like that. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2130.0s)]
*  Like there. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2131.0s)]
*  Pull it down. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2132.0s)]
*  Pull it down. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2133.0s)]
*  I cannot believe how bad I am at that. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2134.0s)]
*  Is it open? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2135.0s)]
*  No, it's not open. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2136.0s)]
*  You've got to open the top. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2137.0s)]
*  Flip that top. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2138.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2139.0s)]
*  Look. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2140.0s)]
*  See this? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2141.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2142.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2143.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2144.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2145.0s)]
*  I feel like I came here to learn this. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2146.0s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2147.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2148.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little weird because it's all black, and so it kind of blends in. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2149.0s)]
*  Especially if you're like us and your eyes are probably going. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2151.0s)]
*  As time goes on. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2154.0s)]
*  Now I can do it myself. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2156.0s)]
*  There's not a chance in hell I could ever do one of those clasps on a bracelet. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2159.0s)]
*  Those little tiny bracelets, like them little clasps. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2164.0s)]
*  Like if my wife tried to get me to do one of those, I'm like, I don't even know what [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2167.0s)]
*  I'm saying. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2171.0s)]
*  I have no idea what that is. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2172.0s)]
*  I see blur. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2173.0s)]
*  I see golden blur. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2174.0s)]
*  What the fuck that is. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2175.0s)]
*  What were we just talking about? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2177.0s)]
*  Well, you were talking about learning the Bible in school. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2180.0s)]
*  So one of the things that a lot of people who have read the Bible or they have read [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2182.0s)]
*  a portion of the Bible. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2187.0s)]
*  I definitely don't think I read the whole thing. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2188.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's the thing. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2189.0s)]
*  It's not very many people do. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2190.0s)]
*  And that's why I asked because a lot of it is kind of tedious history. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2191.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of hebegats and there's the whole line of Christ, all the ancestors [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2196.0s)]
*  and the whole delineation of all that. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2200.0s)]
*  And where I come from, we were encouraged to read like a verse of the Bible, but they [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2202.0s)]
*  would always tell you what it meant. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2207.0s)]
*  And so I kind of went against I use this little pin light and like did it like late at night. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2209.0s)]
*  But I read the whole thing cover to cover and I was eight. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2215.0s)]
*  And if you read like every single book in order, you start to find that there's a lot [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2217.0s)]
*  of really beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, you know, places in the Bible. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2221.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of stuff that's really violent. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2225.0s)]
*  And then there's a lot of stuff that contradicts itself. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2227.0s)]
*  And it's because it was written in different time periods by different authors in different [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2229.0s)]
*  languages. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2232.0s)]
*  And it also has a historical context. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2233.0s)]
*  And so generally, there's a lot of stuff that people leave out when they teach the Bible, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2235.0s)]
*  because it's really hard to explain. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2239.0s)]
*  Like what stuff? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2241.0s)]
*  Well, there's for example, I mean, this one's taught a little bit, but David, King David, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2242.0s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard of him like as of David and Goliath. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2248.0s)]
*  But then he became a powerful king. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2250.0s)]
*  And he saw this woman who this woman is often talked about Bathsheba. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2252.0s)]
*  He sees her bathing on a roof. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2256.0s)]
*  And where we came from, we were taught like she shouldn't have been bathing on the roof. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2258.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2261.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2263.0s)]
*  Anyway, he demands that she come to him and she is the wife of a soldier of his named Uriah, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2265.0s)]
*  a top soldier. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2270.0s)]
*  And he commands her to lie with him and she becomes pregnant. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2272.0s)]
*  And then King David, who is the same guy who had the slingshot of David and Goliath, decides [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2276.0s)]
*  that he's got to figure out how to get her husband back so that her husband can go sleep with her. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2283.0s)]
*  And her husband won't do it because he's loyal to the army. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2287.0s)]
*  And he comes back, but he sleeps like at the floor of the castle, you know, trying to. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2290.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. He's trying to get the husband to go back with the wife. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2294.0s)]
*  So that she the pregnancy will seem like it's his. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2297.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. Yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2299.0s)]
*  In the Bible. In the Bible. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2301.0s)]
*  Dirty David. Yeah, exactly. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2303.0s)]
*  And it doesn't even in there. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2305.0s)]
*  So Uriah won't do it because Uriah is loyal to David. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2307.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. And so then David sends him to the front lines to have him be killed. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2309.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. So that he can marry his wife and get away with that child's not being [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2314.0s)]
*  illegitimate. Oh, boy. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2320.0s)]
*  And then God kills the child because, you know, needs to make the point that David was. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2322.0s)]
*  And think about poor Bathsheba. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2327.0s)]
*  I mean, she's just been like wrung around. Her husband gets killed. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2328.0s)]
*  All these things. Her kid dies because God is punishing David. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2332.0s)]
*  And her husband got killed because he was loyal to the guy who got her pregnant. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2335.0s)]
*  Absolutely. That's not a story a lot of people hear. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2338.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. But you can fact check that one if you'd like. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2341.0s)]
*  Oh, no, I believe you. I'm good at that. I'm good at just, OK, now go argue it. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2343.0s)]
*  I mean, there's something I talk a little bit about in the book Forger, which I encourage everyone to read. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2348.0s)]
*  But in that book, I talk about has a kid that I looked up this whole long, you know, he began he began. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2353.0s)]
*  And there's only four times that it mentions a woman who a child came out of. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2359.0s)]
*  Like, it's all the male line. But occasionally, they'll say so and so, you know, Boaz through Ruth or David's the father through Bathsheba. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2363.0s)]
*  So Bathsheba ended up having a child who became Solomon, who we know a lot of people know these of being the wisest man [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2370.0s)]
*  who ever lived. And he wrote Ecclesiastes. And yeah. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2377.0s)]
*  And so there's four women who are named. And as a child, that was really interesting to me. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2380.0s)]
*  And I would ask, you know, why are these four women in the line of Christ? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2385.0s)]
*  And no one would tell me. And so I started doing the research about that. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2388.0s)]
*  And one was a prostitute. One. Oh, here's the story. You don't hear a lot. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2391.0s)]
*  When you're another Bible story. Sure. There was a woman named Tamar, and she had been married to one of three sons. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2394.0s)]
*  I think there was three. And her husband died before giving her a child. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2402.0s)]
*  So as was the custom in the time and perhaps the law, she married the brother of her dead husband. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2407.0s)]
*  And that man would not give her a child because he didn't want to have a child in his brother's name. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2414.0s)]
*  And so they're allowed to have more than one wife. But this woman was not allowed to have a child. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2421.0s)]
*  So he does something they call onanism. So he like spilled his seed on the ground instead of inside of hers that she couldn't have a baby. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2425.0s)]
*  And so God gets really mad because it will not impregnate her. And so owning gets killed, too. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2431.0s)]
*  And so then her father in law decides not to marry her off to the youngest brother because two of the brothers are already dead. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2437.0s)]
*  Right. And he doesn't want to lose his only son. So he just banishes her. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2443.0s)]
*  And she has nothing because what does a woman have at the time? She doesn't have a husband or a child. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2447.0s)]
*  She has no ability to make a living in the world. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2451.0s)]
*  And so this man is the father in law is really unkind to her in a way that she decides she needs to take something into her own hands. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2455.0s)]
*  And so she dresses up like a prostitute and goes to the side of the road. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2465.0s)]
*  And as he's traveling on the road, she puts herself in front of him and offers her services. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2468.0s)]
*  And he sleeps with her and he does not have payment on him for some reason. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2474.0s)]
*  And so he gives her his staff, which is a token of his word or something. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2477.0s)]
*  So at least he's paying his prostitute and she gets pregnant from this. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2481.0s)]
*  And he orders her when he finds out she's pregnant to be stoned to death, you know, to be killed and executed because, you know, she's not allowed to have a baby outside of wedlock. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2485.0s)]
*  And she said, OK, but let me just return the staff to you that I got from the father of the baby. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2494.0s)]
*  And so then he ends up protecting her and she gets to have the child. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2500.0s)]
*  And that child is in the line of Christ. Whoa. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2504.0s)]
*  So really interesting things. I don't know what you're supposed to learn from that story. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2507.0s)]
*  When I was a kid reading this, I would ask and of course, no one really wanted to tell me because she was rewarded for that. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2512.0s)]
*  That's the interesting thing. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2518.0s)]
*  It's the stories are crazy. It's it's just if you're being honest and if you believe in God, but you also know that people are full of shit. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2519.0s)]
*  You have to put all this stuff through a filter. You just have to. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2528.0s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that there's no God. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2533.0s)]
*  Of course, it doesn't mean that it just it means there's probably something in these stories, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2536.0s)]
*  but we have to be real careful with what that something is. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2542.0s)]
*  And I don't profess to know. I don't I don't know why they condone slavery. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2545.0s)]
*  The Bible condone slavery like flat out. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2549.0s)]
*  It's in there all the time. Yes. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2552.0s)]
*  Women are essentially second class citizens. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2556.0s)]
*  And you know what I found out recently that there was a woman before Eve. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2558.0s)]
*  Depending on who you ask. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2562.0s)]
*  Yeah. So what was that one? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2565.0s)]
*  Well, that's not in the 66 books of the Bible that most people are taught in the Protestant tradition or the 69 or whatever in the Catholic tradition. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2567.0s)]
*  That's part of the Apocrypha. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2574.0s)]
*  So these are books of the Bible that didn't make it into, you know, Christianity as such that we editors cut today. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2575.0s)]
*  Exactly. So that's not considered the word of God. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2584.0s)]
*  What you're reading that is considered or what you heard like word on the street, word on the street. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2588.0s)]
*  Yeah, I heard on the Internet. But yeah, that's a street these days. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2592.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. It's the best street. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2596.0s)]
*  Yeah. Which is not to say it's not true. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2598.0s)]
*  I don't know the truth. So I'm a yoga teacher, among other things. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2600.0s)]
*  And one thing that I say all the time when I'm teaching, which is really common thing as a yoga teacher to say is whatever I am giving you right now is a suggestion. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2603.0s)]
*  So listen to your body. Do what's great for you. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2612.0s)]
*  If this doesn't feel right to you, please don't do it. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2614.0s)]
*  And then you offer modifications, et cetera. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2617.0s)]
*  And what high control religion does, and I'm not saying all religion, I'm saying the culture religion doesn't give you the option of listening to your body or opting out of anything. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2619.0s)]
*  This is the interpretation of the word of God. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2628.0s)]
*  And the one thing I will say is I don't know why Tamar did what she did or why Onan did what he did. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2631.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know whether or not the stories were transcribed accurately or not, even if they were. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2637.0s)]
*  Like I that is a different culture. Right. And was I not wasn't there. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2641.0s)]
*  We don't even know if OJ did it. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2645.0s)]
*  Right. So how are you going to know what happened to David and Bathsheba? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2648.0s)]
*  I mean, we're pretty sure he did it. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2651.0s)]
*  Well, but I was just reading some story that OJ hired thugs to. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2654.0s)]
*  There was another thing or some thing that he said that he hired thugs to kill his wife and Ron Goldman. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2658.0s)]
*  So this is really recent, is my point. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2664.0s)]
*  And there's a bunch of versions of it and depends on who gets into power, whatever version gets propagated. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2666.0s)]
*  Right. Like if you if there was no Internet and no independent journalism [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2672.0s)]
*  and they never had to account for the fact that Iraq never really had weapons of mass destruction. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2677.0s)]
*  If the people in charge, if we're living in 1963, how long does it take before people figure out that Iraq didn't have those weapons? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2684.0s)]
*  How long do we ever find out? I don't know. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2692.0s)]
*  I was going to say you might not ever find out. You might not ever find out. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2694.0s)]
*  It took forever just to figure out that the Gulf of Tonkin was a false flag that got us into Vietnam. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2696.0s)]
*  I mean, it took decades for that to come out. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2701.0s)]
*  And now that's widely accepted. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2704.0s)]
*  So our own history is sketchy as fuck. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2706.0s)]
*  Our own history, our real absolute history is sketchy as fuck. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2710.0s)]
*  And that's why conspiracy theories are so fun. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2716.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, of course. And and in a sense, occult is just a whole conspiracy theory. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2718.0s)]
*  I mean, but they control the narrative, right? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2722.0s)]
*  Completely control the narrative and no one's allowed to question. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2724.0s)]
*  And if they do, they're excommunicated. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2727.0s)]
*  And one of the ways you know something as a cult is that they will always tell you that anyone who left, it's different than outsiders. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2729.0s)]
*  I mean, outsiders are people who maybe had never had access to the truth. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2736.0s)]
*  But people who are quitters, they literally call them quitters where I come from. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2739.0s)]
*  It's a good name. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2743.0s)]
*  I know it really is. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2744.0s)]
*  Nobody likes quitters. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2745.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2746.0s)]
*  And so quitters were just anything they said was of the devil. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2747.0s)]
*  And so you were not allowed to talk to anyone who left. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2750.0s)]
*  And that's really common in cults. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2752.0s)]
*  You couldn't even talk to them. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2754.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's a Scientology thing, too, I believe. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2755.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I think it's really common in any high control group, I'm sure. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2757.0s)]
*  Yeah, because you can't you really do need to control the narrative and you can't let other stories get in there. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2761.0s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. God damn. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2767.0s)]
*  It's so interesting how these patterns reoccur all over the world. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2772.0s)]
*  You know, there's a guy in Australia that says he's Jesus and he runs this whole cult in Australia. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2777.0s)]
*  And he has this woman who he says is Mary. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2783.0s)]
*  But the problem is there was another woman who was married before and it didn't work out with the original Mary. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2785.0s)]
*  So he tells this new lady, I was wrong about that other lady. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2791.0s)]
*  You're Mary. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2795.0s)]
*  And so do you know that they say that the translation for Mary actually was woman? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2797.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. And so that the word possibly just means I mean, you think about it. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2802.0s)]
*  There's so many Marys in the Bible. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2805.0s)]
*  They talk about Mary Magdalene or Mary Jesus or you know that it perhaps is just the translation. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2806.0s)]
*  It's just the translation for woman. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2812.0s)]
*  Jesus as a historical figure is controversial. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2814.0s)]
*  There's people that say there's absolute evidence for Jesus. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2818.0s)]
*  But then there's people that say, do you know like how much historical record we have on people that live thousands of years before Jesus? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2821.0s)]
*  You know, there's there's people that lived that they know what they said. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2828.0s)]
*  They know where they ate. They know where they went. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2834.0s)]
*  They know so much about them. But the Jesus one is kind of there's people that say, yes, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2836.0s)]
*  there's historical documents that show he existed. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2841.0s)]
*  And then there's a bunch of documentaries that you can watch. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2846.0s)]
*  Like, boy, the evidence is kind of sketchy. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2848.0s)]
*  It seems to be a thought like a recurring thing in many religions. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2851.0s)]
*  It seems to be like Hercules. Right. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2857.0s)]
*  It seems to be there's a bunch of these that are like real similar to that, like the child of a god that comes down to fix everything. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2859.0s)]
*  There's a lot of traditions where you have a virgin birth. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2867.0s)]
*  That is true. And I am certainly not here to tell anybody what is true or not true. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2870.0s)]
*  But the gospels that are written about Jesus were written after. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2874.0s)]
*  Right. Not during. And that was, you know, common. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2878.0s)]
*  I mean, Socrates never wrote anything down. He told stories to Plato. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2880.0s)]
*  And how long after his death? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2883.0s)]
*  Well, I think the first one now I feel like I am not a historian here, but I think the first one was like 100 years. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2885.0s)]
*  And so you have Apostle Paul who wrote, but he only saw Jesus after. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2894.0s)]
*  Like he was on the road to Damascus. And so he saw Jesus after Jesus had been crucified and risen. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2899.0s)]
*  So what he saw was a ghost of Jesus. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2904.0s)]
*  But the other gospels were not written by anyone who had seen Jesus in that way, even though they were the versions like of when you have Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2906.0s)]
*  These are the versions that they were told. So I don't know, maybe 100 years. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2917.0s)]
*  So this is where belief hits for people that are listening to this right now, because there's going to be a certain percentage of people right now that have their hackles up because someone might be insinuating that maybe all this Jesus stuff is not legit. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2920.0s)]
*  And that's not what anybody's saying. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2936.0s)]
*  What we're saying is these stories were written down 100 years after he was alive. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2939.0s)]
*  And people are full of shit. That's it. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2947.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean that he didn't exist because if someone did exist, like if if the early emergence of humans in the in the world, let's imagine what they mean by this story. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2951.0s)]
*  If the early emergence of humans in this world were put down here to figure it out on their own like a bunch of Lockkey kids like latchkey kids from the 1970s. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2965.0s)]
*  Figure it out on your own. I'm going to give you ways to live your life. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2975.0s)]
*  Tell everybody, but I'm hands off. I'm hands off. I'm on afterlife type of guy. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2980.0s)]
*  I want you. I'm not going to come down and explain it again. Pop out of the clouds and freak everybody out. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2986.0s)]
*  I did that once. I did it once. I'm done. You guys killed me. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2991.0s)]
*  So I'm just saying live your life this way. If that was a real thing, what I mean, what would be any different than the Bible? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=2996.0s)]
*  What would be any different about the if a real event like that actually happened where the the the son of God came down and explained to mankind what they're doing wrong and live this amazing life and taught so many people. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3006.0s)]
*  And they spread his wisdom and they spread his his information. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3020.0s)]
*  It wouldn't be any different than the Bible because you're still even if even if it was like very clear what he was saying and and very clear what he had done in the impact and how they all knew he was the son of God. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3023.0s)]
*  By the time 100 years go by, people talking about it. Who the fuck knows who knows? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3035.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, Jesus did really well. So Jesus didn't write anything down, right? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3041.0s)]
*  Like he was storyteller. Jesus told a lot of parables and those are easier to remember. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3046.0s)]
*  So if you listen to like his Sermon on the Mount or, you know, these various things, it's possible that some of these stories, which they can be interpreted more than one way. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3051.0s)]
*  But like, you know, to say that you have you heard the expression casting pearls to swine? Yes. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3060.0s)]
*  What does that mean? Well, in the story of the prodigal son, there was this and Jesus tells the story. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3066.0s)]
*  Right. So there's these two brothers and one brother stays and does everything that his father wants him to do. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3073.0s)]
*  And the other brother says, give me the son. He says the younger son says, give me my inheritance now. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3077.0s)]
*  I don't want to wait till your dad just give me my inheritance now. I want to go experience life. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3082.0s)]
*  And the father gives his younger son his inheritance. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3085.0s)]
*  And this young man who is raised well goes out and hires prostitutes, does all the things right. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3088.0s)]
*  And he goes out and just and lives this loose life. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3096.0s)]
*  And he finds that he runs out of money and he is in a pen of pigs and he is willing to eat what even the pigs won't eat, like the leftovers. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3098.0s)]
*  And he is facedown in the mud and the in according to the story in the pig pen and says, even if I was a servant from my father, I'd be treated better than this. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3107.0s)]
*  And so he goes back, etc. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3117.0s)]
*  And his older brother is really upset because the father brings the son back and treats him, you know, just so grateful his son's returning to him. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3118.0s)]
*  And his brother says, you know, or an expression like you're casting pearls to swine. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3127.0s)]
*  I mean, like my brother is a pig. My brother is like, you know, from the pig pen. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3133.0s)]
*  And you're giving him something that he doesn't deserve. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3137.0s)]
*  And that whole story, I mean, you can interpret it any way you want. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3140.0s)]
*  But this idea that you tell stories like this and someone could say God is willing to take you back and perhaps even better if you have experienced life and that just being obedient isn't the only way to live a life. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3143.0s)]
*  Maybe that's the I don't know what the real interpretation is. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3156.0s)]
*  Right. But like when you read a story like that or you hear the story, Jesus didn't write it down. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3159.0s)]
*  But if you told that story, then now people come to that and they think, what does that mean? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3164.0s)]
*  Does that mean when I find myself in a pig pen that I can repent and go back? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3170.0s)]
*  What does it mean? Isn't it funny that Jesus is a storyteller? Yeah, because storytellers, the person who stands in front of people and commands attention and we know how that goes. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3175.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Well, you're a storyteller. Well, sort of. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3184.0s)]
*  You don't think you're a storyteller? I talk shit on stage. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3188.0s)]
*  So it's just jokes. And those are stories. Some of them are stories. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3192.0s)]
*  Yeah. Some of them are just making fun of things. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3196.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's different than someone who like tells you stories and imparts wisdom. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3199.0s)]
*  Like if someone's standing in front of a group of people imparting wisdom, that's a very bizarre relationship. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3206.0s)]
*  It's a very slippery position for the person that has the podium. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3211.0s)]
*  Very slippery because you could start believing all this nonsense. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3217.0s)]
*  You could start believing that you're different than everybody else. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3221.0s)]
*  You could start believing that you are the son of God, even if you're not. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3224.0s)]
*  I'm not even talking about Jesus. I'm talking about someone today, someone today, even today in this day and age with the Internet. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3228.0s)]
*  If you started doing something like that and you're schizophrenic, you could believe it. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3233.0s)]
*  Lots of people. Lots of people believe they're the son of God right now. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3237.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent legit. And then lots of people believe that other people are demons. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3240.0s)]
*  There's a lot of like real funky beliefs that people hold on to. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3245.0s)]
*  And if someone like I said, if someone was a charismatic leader and they pretended to be the son of God versus someone who is actually the son of God, 100 years later, it's going to be very difficult to parse out what's what. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3249.0s)]
*  Right. Which is a problem, which is a real problem. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3263.0s)]
*  If you want to like put all your eggs in one basket, you got to pick a religion. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3265.0s)]
*  Like, boy, if you're agnostic, like which one of you guys is right? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3269.0s)]
*  Is this something the Hindus? Right? Maybe the Buddhas, right? I don't know. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3273.0s)]
*  You know, some people would say that the Buddha and Jesus have an awful lot in common. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3277.0s)]
*  And if there is a right that a lot of those beliefs are going to overlap and it is right to live a good life is to treat other people the way that you would want to be treated. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3281.0s)]
*  You know, try to be nice. Love your neighbor. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3291.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I think there's universal truth in all that stuff. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3294.0s)]
*  I think the source of it is fascinating. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3299.0s)]
*  Like, what are the universal truths? But we always we have to look at things through a filter of reality and the filter of reality. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3302.0s)]
*  We know human beings are full of shit. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3311.0s)]
*  So you have to put that in there. You have to put that with everything. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3314.0s)]
*  You can't just say they wouldn't lie about religion. Stop. That's nonsense. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3317.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean that God's not real. It doesn't mean that Jesus didn't exist because maybe look, maybe Jesus is the ultimate. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3321.0s)]
*  It's like this is the last word and then we're going to let you guys figure it out on your own. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3329.0s)]
*  And maybe if God exists, OK, let's just as a thought experiment. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3334.0s)]
*  If God exists, why would God engineer an animal to be at the top of the food chain that is so filled with greed and wants so much power that it's willing to take over enormous swaths of land with giant machines and murder anybody who gets in their way? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3339.0s)]
*  And it's all justified in the name of nationalism. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3358.0s)]
*  Why would God universally impart that kind of sensibility on a species? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3361.0s)]
*  Why would God tolerate it? Why would God tolerate crime and murder and all the horrible things that we see today? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3367.0s)]
*  Why would God want any of this stuff to go on? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3373.0s)]
*  If God is so all powerful that he created the universe, is this just a first draft? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3377.0s)]
*  Did you like try like say like the idea is free will. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3383.0s)]
*  Right. That's the answer to it is that in the garden when Adam and Eve didn't know the difference and then they partake of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that like by the choice to do that brought sin into the world. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3387.0s)]
*  And once there's sin into the world, then humans always have the choice to follow the light or follow the darkness. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3399.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the party line, right? That it is human choice. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3405.0s)]
*  Right. My point was that maybe God's ultimate plan is to make things as fucked up as possible so that it forces people to figure it out. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3409.0s)]
*  It forces an evolution of consciousness. It forces us to go to the light. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3420.0s)]
*  It forces us because it's the only way we survive. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3425.0s)]
*  Like that could it could be like a test like the entire human species, the entire civilization, the whole thing. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3428.0s)]
*  It's just some gigantic test to see if you get it right. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3435.0s)]
*  Did you ever read A Wrinkle in Time when you're a kid? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3438.0s)]
*  Whose book is that? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3440.0s)]
*  Madeline Alingle. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3441.0s)]
*  I've heard of it. I don't think I read it. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3442.0s)]
*  Okay. I was I don't know if it was taught in schools, but kids read it for a year. I don't know when it came out in the 70s probably. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3444.0s)]
*  But she says in an interview later that she thinks that in the end that God is waiting for every single person to choose to believe and to choose to follow and that the light. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3449.0s)]
*  So in A Wrinkle in Time is a story or science in and a lot of things, but that when you see the light and you're drawn to the light that you might be tempted by the darkness. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3463.0s)]
*  But when you really know what light is that you'll always choose that. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3473.0s)]
*  And so that the end of the day that we're all going to see the light. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3476.0s)]
*  But even if you don't believe in religion, if you know like good experiences and bad experiences in your life and when you're happy with yourself and when you're upset with yourself in your life, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3480.0s)]
*  you generally know like there's a direction that you really want to be moving in and the more life experience you have the more stupid things you do the more you learn. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3491.0s)]
*  And so the more you get a better database to draw from to understand what each and individual choice means in the greater the greater picture of your your existence. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3500.0s)]
*  And as you go further and further you go if you're living a harmonious life, you go almost naturally towards that direction. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3509.0s)]
*  Trying to be nicer to people, love your neighbor, have more peace in the world, don't be murdering people, you know, and that's generally like how most religions want you to believe. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3518.0s)]
*  It's like the origin of it is God. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3528.0s)]
*  There's some sort of a guidebook for being a human. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3532.0s)]
*  That's the origin of it. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3536.0s)]
*  It seems like that they were just trying to like you can't just let people be feral. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3537.0s)]
*  You got to give them some guidelines. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3541.0s)]
*  You got to and one of the best ways is to someone's watching all the time. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3543.0s)]
*  In the sky. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3547.0s)]
*  But maybe he really is. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3549.0s)]
*  Maybe there really is something that watches everything. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3550.0s)]
*  It might not be watching, but it might be like integrated into the entire existence of the whole thing. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3553.0s)]
*  Maybe that's what the prodigal son is about. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3559.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3561.0s)]
*  You know, he goes and has all these experiences, find himself like making every mistake possible and then sees the light and goes back to his father. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3562.0s)]
*  Yeah, he goes back to the kingdom of right. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3568.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3570.0s)]
*  There's wisdom in all these things. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3571.0s)]
*  And these people that lived and were writing things down on animal skins while they were engaging in wars with spears. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3573.0s)]
*  You know, fucking wild times. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3579.0s)]
*  And they were trying to sort it all out. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3582.0s)]
*  Have you read Meditations Marcus Aurelius? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3584.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3586.0s)]
*  Isn't that wild stuff? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3587.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3588.0s)]
*  That's it's wild. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3589.0s)]
*  How brilliant this guy was. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3590.0s)]
*  Two thousand years ago, like his understanding of how to live a life. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3592.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3597.0s)]
*  He was so valuable and his concept of forgiveness, like forgiveness. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3598.0s)]
*  He's a fucking Roman. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3603.0s)]
*  I mean, this dude is like this badass soldier. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3605.0s)]
*  And he's like, it's very important to forgive everybody. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3609.0s)]
*  Even forgive your enemies. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3613.0s)]
*  Like he had this incredible wisdom about logistically maintaining your objective perspective of the world. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3614.0s)]
*  It was really interesting. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3625.0s)]
*  We know people were smart as shit back then. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3627.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3629.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3630.0s)]
*  And if you go back two thousand years before him, when people start writing all this stuff down. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3631.0s)]
*  Well, people had a lot stronger ability to concentrate, obviously. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3636.0s)]
*  Right. They weren't distracted. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3641.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3642.0s)]
*  No tape talk. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3643.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3644.0s)]
*  But even before things were written, people really had command over language and oral traditions and their memory. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3645.0s)]
*  They had to remember. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3650.0s)]
*  Like you think about where to find whatever it is when you're a forager, where to find the hunt. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3651.0s)]
*  All of these traditions have to be passed down for humans to stay alive. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3656.0s)]
*  I mean, we're really fragile creatures. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3659.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3661.0s)]
*  And to think that when before there was anything except for spheres, how did humans stay alive? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3662.0s)]
*  They stayed alive because they could remember. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3668.0s)]
*  They could remember what could kill them. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3670.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3671.0s)]
*  Just like we used to be able to remember phone numbers. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3672.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3674.0s)]
*  You remember? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3675.0s)]
*  Yeah. Even back then. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3676.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3677.0s)]
*  I had so many phone numbers in my head. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3678.0s)]
*  I still remember the phone number of the field. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3679.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3681.0s)]
*  I do. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3682.0s)]
*  I do. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3683.0s)]
*  Because it was the one place. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3684.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3685.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3686.0s)]
*  That was my home. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3687.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3688.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3689.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3690.0s)]
*  My mom was a survival trainer. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3691.0s)]
*  She trained people to survive and she trained us to survive. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3692.0s)]
*  And one of the big things was surviving the apocalypse. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3695.0s)]
*  But some of the survival techniques are actually really valuable. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3697.0s)]
*  And that's the thing about forgiveness or anything else. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3700.0s)]
*  Even if somebody is telling you something that is in their own best interest doesn't mean it's not true. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3704.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3710.0s)]
*  And that there's so many truths than anything. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3711.0s)]
*  And so learning to survive literally off the land or in the desert or things like that was a really harsh training that I had as a kid. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3714.0s)]
*  But it taught me to look around everywhere that I've been ever since and to pay attention. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3720.0s)]
*  And I mean, that's a gift. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3726.0s)]
*  I think about that when I think about forgiveness too. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3728.0s)]
*  Like part of forgiving people is because on some level they taught you a lesson. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3730.0s)]
*  Well, even in cults they can give you valuable skills. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3733.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3736.0s)]
*  I mean, if somebody could teach you survival techniques, how to survive the apocalypse. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3737.0s)]
*  If you're really worried about the apocalypse, you need to learn how to survive the apocalypse. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3740.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3744.0s)]
*  So, you know, they do it for good intentions. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3745.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3747.0s)]
*  And some of it pays off a little bit. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3748.0s)]
*  Well, do you remember the one in Los Angeles that had billboards up and with a very specific date? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3750.0s)]
*  Oh, what was the date? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3757.0s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3759.0s)]
*  But I remember there was this Thai restaurant I used to go to on Ventura, this great Thai spot. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3761.0s)]
*  And right above it was this fucking billboard that was it was giving you a very specific date. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3767.0s)]
*  Like, repent, the end is here. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3773.0s)]
*  And it's going to be this time. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3775.0s)]
*  I'm like, is this is like the most brilliant album release? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3776.0s)]
*  Like, you know what I'm saying? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3780.0s)]
*  Like some rock band has figured out a way to like make something go viral before the Internet. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3782.0s)]
*  I guess the Internet was around then. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3787.0s)]
*  It was not that long ago. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3789.0s)]
*  I want to say like maybe eight years ago, 10 years ago. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3792.0s)]
*  Was it? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3795.0s)]
*  Wow, that's pretty recent. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3796.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3797.0s)]
*  2011, Judgment Day, May 21st, 2011. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3798.0s)]
*  Cry Mighty Unto God. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3802.0s)]
*  Monday through Friday, live open forum on familyradio.com. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3804.0s)]
*  And what happened on May 11th? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3809.0s)]
*  So, yeah, that was only 13 years ago. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3810.0s)]
*  Jamie, what happened on May 11th? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3812.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3813.0s)]
*  Fucking zero. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3814.0s)]
*  These people were out of their mind. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3815.0s)]
*  Like Y2K was a little like that, too. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3818.0s)]
*  Well, also December 21st, 2012. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3820.0s)]
*  That was the end of the Mayan calendar. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3822.0s)]
*  My license plate used to be December 2012. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3824.0s)]
*  DEC 12, whatever it was. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3829.0s)]
*  But that was the end of the long count of the Mayan calendar. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3831.0s)]
*  And all the Cougs thought that was the end of the world. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3835.0s)]
*  So we actually did an end of the world show in Los Angeles with my friends from Honey, HoneyBand, my friend Suzanne, Joey Diaz, Doug Stanhope. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3837.0s)]
*  It was wild. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3846.0s)]
*  And what did you do? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3847.0s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3848.0s)]
*  Nobody died. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3849.0s)]
*  We had a good time. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3850.0s)]
*  We had a good time. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3851.0s)]
*  The world keeps going. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3852.0s)]
*  But there's, you know, it's just a long calendar. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3853.0s)]
*  It's a very bizarre ancient calendar that they don't really fully understand. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3856.0s)]
*  So to say that was the end of the world seems a little silly. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3860.0s)]
*  Well, you know, when they give these dates, like when my grandfather gave the date of 1977, they can also say anytime it doesn't happen that the calendars are wrong. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3863.0s)]
*  Ah, how convenient. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3872.0s)]
*  Do they have a good calendar? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3874.0s)]
*  Can I see that calendar? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3876.0s)]
*  Well, you know, but the point is like, oh, well, you know, with the Star of Bethlehem and all this, like maybe that was redated because Herod didn't want us to know like when Jesus was really born because he was killing all the babies and he didn't really know the date of Jesus's birth. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3878.0s)]
*  That's why he was killing, you know, all the young boys as opposed to just that one and et cetera, et cetera. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3891.0s)]
*  Back to the lady who was around with Eve. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3896.0s)]
*  Who is that lady? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3899.0s)]
*  I assume you're talking about Lilith, but that's not in the tradition that I read. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3900.0s)]
*  But Lilith was supposedly I didn't even know Lilith existed until like two years ago, I think. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3904.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3909.0s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3910.0s)]
*  Has that changed your life in some way? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3911.0s)]
*  Who the fuck is Lilith? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3912.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3913.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3914.0s)]
*  It was an eye opener. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3915.0s)]
*  I questioned everything after that. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3917.0s)]
*  What is the Lilith story exactly? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3920.0s)]
*  So again, I was not raised on the story at all. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3922.0s)]
*  I don't know, Jamie, do you know the story? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3925.0s)]
*  So the Lilith story, I've heard some, but I feel like I'd misquote it. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3928.0s)]
*  So the Lilith story they decided was BS. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3931.0s)]
*  So they left it out of the big book. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3933.0s)]
*  She's been interpreted as particular as Satan. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3935.0s)]
*  Oh, Satan. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3939.0s)]
*  Well, sure. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3940.0s)]
*  Of course, she's a lady. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3941.0s)]
*  She made me do terrible things. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3942.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3944.0s)]
*  Well, Eve did that to the original Hebrew word from which the name Lilith is taken is [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3945.0s)]
*  in the biblical Hebrew, the book of Isaiah, though Lilith herself is not mentioned in [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3949.0s)]
*  any biblical text in late antiquity. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3954.0s)]
*  And how do you say that word? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3957.0s)]
*  Mandean? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3958.0s)]
*  How do you say that word? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3959.0s)]
*  Do you know Mandean? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3960.0s)]
*  Mandean and Jewish sources from 500 AD onward, Lilith appears in his historical, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3962.0s)]
*  storalous, storalous incantations, incorporating a short mythic story in various concepts [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3970.0s)]
*  and localities that give partial descriptions of her. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3976.0s)]
*  She is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, Nida, Shabbat, Bava Batra, and the conflict [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3979.0s)]
*  of Adam and Eve with Satan as Adam's first wife. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3986.0s)]
*  And in the Zohar Leviticus 19a as a hot fiery female who first cohabitated with man. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3990.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=3999.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4000.0s)]
*  Many rabbinic authorities, including, boy, there's another word, Maimonides, Maimonides [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4001.0s)]
*  and Menachem Mary reject the existence of Lilith. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4008.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4014.0s)]
*  So Lilith is controversial. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4015.0s)]
*  Very controversial. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4016.0s)]
*  Like all hot ladies. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4017.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4018.0s)]
*  But the fact that she was the first. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4019.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4024.0s)]
*  I mean, again, that's not the tradition that most Christians are taught. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4025.0s)]
*  I mean, it's considered part of the Apocrypha. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4029.0s)]
*  So I mean, I don't have any idea what the truth is, but she has been vilified even more [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4031.0s)]
*  than Eve. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4036.0s)]
*  Although if you think about it, Eve's pretty vilified too. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4037.0s)]
*  I mean, she caused the downfall of humankind. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4039.0s)]
*  She's the reason why we're all here. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4040.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4042.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4043.0s)]
*  It's, I mean, what's the root of that story? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4044.0s)]
*  That's the real question. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4047.0s)]
*  Like, what was the original thing they were trying to convey? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4048.0s)]
*  I will not. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4053.0s)]
*  With original humans. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4054.0s)]
*  Take a stab on that. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4055.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4056.0s)]
*  But at least Christianity has like an origin story. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4057.0s)]
*  You know, an origin story for everything. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4062.0s)]
*  For the universe, for people. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4065.0s)]
*  And when you didn't have science and you didn't have any understanding of cosmology, you need [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4068.0s)]
*  something. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4074.0s)]
*  We need something. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4075.0s)]
*  Thousands of years just staring up at the stars. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4076.0s)]
*  Anybody know what the fuck's going on up there? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4078.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4080.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4081.0s)]
*  There's Thor. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4082.0s)]
*  He lives up there. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4084.0s)]
*  And then there's Zeus. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4085.0s)]
*  He's running shit. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4086.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4087.0s)]
*  Well, looking at the stars, storytelling too. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4088.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4091.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4092.0s)]
*  In the beginning, there was the word. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4093.0s)]
*  Well, I think that's one of the things that's really screwed up human beings. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4094.0s)]
*  And I don't think in any small way is light pollution. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4098.0s)]
*  I think our inability to see that we are in this celestial, majestic cosmos, this thing, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4102.0s)]
*  it's not just black with a few bright lights. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4112.0s)]
*  The whole thing is lit up. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4115.0s)]
*  And it's the most magnificent thing you could ever see. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4117.0s)]
*  But we sacrifice it almost for everyone that lives in cities. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4121.0s)]
*  If you live in cities, you don't go anywhere and see it. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4126.0s)]
*  You sacrifice a humbling spiritual experience of just staring at the stars. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4129.0s)]
*  And I think it's spiritual poisoning. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4136.0s)]
*  It's like if you have vitamin deficiencies. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4142.0s)]
*  I think you have a spiritual deficiency, just a natural, universal spiritual deficiency [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4146.0s)]
*  from not seeing the stars. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4152.0s)]
*  I think it puts our place in the universe in perspective like nothing else can. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4154.0s)]
*  Because it's there. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4161.0s)]
*  It's real. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4162.0s)]
*  It's not a concept. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4163.0s)]
*  It's not something that you have to use a microscope or a telescope to see. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4165.0s)]
*  It's right in front of you. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4168.0s)]
*  And it's absolutely spectacular. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4170.0s)]
*  On a clear night in the mountains where there's no light pollution, you see the stars, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4173.0s)]
*  you're just like, wow, is that up there every night? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4178.0s)]
*  Did you used to go to Joshua Tree when you lived around LA? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4182.0s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4185.0s)]
*  Oh, so Joshua Tree is still so magical for that reason because there's no lights. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4186.0s)]
*  I've heard. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4190.0s)]
*  I've heard it's incredible out there. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4191.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not too far from where I am. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4192.0s)]
*  And when I feel that I need to commune with something greater than myself, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4194.0s)]
*  you just go there and you just lay down and look at the stars. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4198.0s)]
*  Light pollution is spiritual poisoning. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4200.0s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4202.0s)]
*  It really is. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4203.0s)]
*  And it's a big factor, I think, in how lost we are and how we're not consistently humbled [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4204.0s)]
*  every night by the majesty of the stars. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4212.0s)]
*  If we were consistently humbled every night, I think we'd generally be like, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4215.0s)]
*  you could tone people down a little bit. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4219.0s)]
*  There is something really healing about looking at the stars. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4222.0s)]
*  And there's also the ability to literally not be lost if you know how to read the stars. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4226.0s)]
*  So that is something I was trained by my uncle who was somewhat of an astronomer. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4230.0s)]
*  But to look at the stars and to always know where you are. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4234.0s)]
*  And if you know how to read the stars, you can never be lost. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4237.0s)]
*  So you could navigate with the stars? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4240.0s)]
*  If you were in a boat, could you do it? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4243.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4244.0s)]
*  I don't know if I could do it very well from a boat. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4245.0s)]
*  But I could do it because I know how to put a stick in the ground [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4248.0s)]
*  and to see the difference in the way that the sun goes so that you can see where you are. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4251.0s)]
*  Because you got to know where the North Star is, obviously. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4255.0s)]
*  But then you also have to know what time of year it is to some degree. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4257.0s)]
*  So if you're lost for or you think you're lost for a matter of months or years, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4259.0s)]
*  you would need to have some sort of idea where you are. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4263.0s)]
*  And if you're in the desert, it's hard to tell seasons. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4266.0s)]
*  But if I was on land, I could do it. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4268.0s)]
*  So you'd have to add up the days? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4270.0s)]
*  Well, you don't even have to add up the days. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4273.0s)]
*  You just have to know what season you're in. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4274.0s)]
*  And you can tell that by the angle of the sun. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4276.0s)]
*  Right. But if you get lost? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4278.0s)]
*  Well, sure. Although you don't have to do that. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4280.0s)]
*  You might just never know. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4283.0s)]
*  So you guys are getting prepared to be lost for years. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4285.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. My mom used to have this phrase. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4287.0s)]
*  I think she made it up. But it's survive fear, survive with faith. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4289.0s)]
*  And so she taught everyone that those five letters stand for what you should do first. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4292.0s)]
*  You know, so the first thing. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4296.0s)]
*  What do you think the first thing you should do if you're lost or you think you're lost? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4297.0s)]
*  Get to a high space to look around. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4301.0s)]
*  Well, the first thing you should do is shelter. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4304.0s)]
*  First thing? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4307.0s)]
*  The first thing you should do is shelter. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4308.0s)]
*  If you don't have shelter, you're going to lose your body heat. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4309.0s)]
*  Depends on where you are, of course. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4311.0s)]
*  But if you're anywhere that gets cold and sometimes you don't know it's going to get cold. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4312.0s)]
*  Desert doesn't seem like it gets cold. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4315.0s)]
*  Have you been in a desert night? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4317.0s)]
*  Yeah, they get cold. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4318.0s)]
*  It's very freezing. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4319.0s)]
*  So shelter is the first thing. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4320.0s)]
*  And then fire, because the warmth is really important. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4322.0s)]
*  So survive fear. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4324.0s)]
*  So it's shelter and then fire. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4326.0s)]
*  And then the thing is signaling. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4328.0s)]
*  So if you want to be found, you put up a signal. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4329.0s)]
*  If you don't want to be found, you need to know what creates a signal for people who are looking. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4331.0s)]
*  So for example, like if you are in the desert, you try to find dark rocks to put SOS. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4336.0s)]
*  But if you don't want to be found, you try to never put a contrast. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4341.0s)]
*  So you try not to have anything that would contrast with the color of the land from a plane that a plane would see as contrast. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4344.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4349.0s)]
*  There's a lot of fun stuff like that. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4350.0s)]
*  So they were preparing you for hiding and for surviving. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4352.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4356.0s)]
*  And who are you going to be hiding from? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4357.0s)]
*  Well, so after the second coming, when everybody goes up to heaven, who's good, all that's left is the demons in the world. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4358.0s)]
*  And there's a thousand years of terror that will rain upon the earth till the blood rises to the horse's bridles. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4366.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4371.0s)]
*  And you guys were preparing for this when you were little kids. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4373.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4376.0s)]
*  Oh, demons. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4377.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4380.0s)]
*  But if you're a good person, you're going to heaven. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4381.0s)]
*  So you don't have to. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4383.0s)]
*  So you probably heard some of those stories, right? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4384.0s)]
*  There's a whole books on these like left behind series. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4387.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4390.0s)]
*  So like who gets left behind. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4391.0s)]
*  But didn't they do a bunch of movies? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4392.0s)]
*  I think so. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4393.0s)]
*  I think Kurt Cameron did it. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4394.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4395.0s)]
*  I heard they're amazing. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4396.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4398.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4399.0s)]
*  I can't speak to that. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4400.0s)]
*  But yes, there's a lot of that because it's part of a lot of traditions. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4401.0s)]
*  And the idea, though, is that some people are left behind in order to try to win the last people like all the evil people. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4404.0s)]
*  Sort of like Noah's Ark. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4413.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4414.0s)]
*  Like Noah's left and he gets on this ark and like it's his job to mean why didn't God just take Noah to heaven. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4415.0s)]
*  Right. But like he gets this boat and he has his family and all the animals and he gets to like stare clear from the flood. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4420.0s)]
*  Or you have Sodom and Gomorrah. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4425.0s)]
*  You have a lot. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4426.0s)]
*  The only good person left. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4427.0s)]
*  And he wants to like help the people in the town or Jonah and Nineveh where he's like told to go tell the people they're bad and then like you know God saves the people anyway. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4428.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of stories of God changing his mind. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4436.0s)]
*  And yes, I know a lot of Bible stories. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4438.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4440.0s)]
*  There's definitely a lot of stories of God changing his mind. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4441.0s)]
*  Yeah. So if you leave some people behind who know how to lead the army of God, you can then proselytize and bring people into true faith or righteousness. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4443.0s)]
*  It's also kind of like, I don't know, a way to keep people a little bit isolated if you're trying to teach them to do something that other people don't know how to do. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4453.0s)]
*  And I was very ashamed of knowing like that kind of thing. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4461.0s)]
*  So it's the kind of thing I talk about in Forger is like I spent a lot of time really feeling like I couldn't acclimate to the regular world like later because I, you know, it's like if you're always looking at I'm sure Navy SEALs feel this way. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4463.0s)]
*  But you know, like you're always waiting for a disaster. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4477.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4480.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4481.0s)]
*  And you're always thinking preemptively. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4482.0s)]
*  And what can I do to avert this disaster? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4484.0s)]
*  How did you get that out of your head? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4486.0s)]
*  It's still in my head, Joe. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4488.0s)]
*  For real? [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4489.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4490.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4491.0s)]
*  So right now you're preparing for the end of the world. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4492.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I walked in your lair and I'm like, okay, there's all dudes here. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4494.0s)]
*  Where's the exes? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4497.0s)]
*  Like, no. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4498.0s)]
*  No, but I mean, to some degree, I mean, I'm not actively preparing, but I feel like I, yeah, I mean, it makes it really hard to trust people when you've been trained that the people that you think you can trust are going to betray you. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4499.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4510.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4511.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4512.0s)]
*  Really hard to get that out of your head. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4513.0s)]
*  I had a friend who was a Mormon. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4515.0s)]
*  And when they left, she was like in her 40s. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4516.0s)]
*  And she said she became really susceptible to any kind of like spiritual people, spirituality, like con people. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4519.0s)]
*  She just had this trusting nature from being like a strict Mormon her whole life. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4527.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden cut loose. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4532.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4534.0s)]
*  And didn't, you know, didn't know to distrust people. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4535.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4538.0s)]
*  So it wasn't programmed in. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4539.0s)]
*  Because if you're only around people who are homogenous and they're like, you're taught. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4540.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4544.0s)]
*  I was that like everybody in your group is trustworthy. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4545.0s)]
*  You don't see the signs. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4547.0s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4548.0s)]
*  I mean, you don't know the red flags, as people would say. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4549.0s)]
*  She also said, like, she she found herself to be susceptible to people telling her things. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4551.0s)]
*  Like, she just had like this automatic inclination to not question and believe things that came from being strict, strict religion. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4557.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4565.0s)]
*  Why did she leave in her 40s? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4566.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4567.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a tough time to leave. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4568.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4571.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4572.0s)]
*  I don't know what the story behind it was exactly. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4573.0s)]
*  I never got into it. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4576.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing about cults is it does make it really difficult to survive on the outside. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4578.0s)]
*  And I certainly know a lot of people have taken their lives after being excommunicated from the field. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4583.0s)]
*  And I had I had a dear friend, the first person who ever told me that use that word that is a cult. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4588.0s)]
*  And I had been out for years and I didn't I mean, it's not like I never heard the word, but I didn't apply it the way we were raised. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4594.0s)]
*  He had written newspaper articles, he's a professor, et cetera. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4600.0s)]
*  And he took his life because it was really, really, really hard to live outside. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4603.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4610.0s)]
*  And there's been many others who have done that. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4611.0s)]
*  And there's also people are ashamed once they reintegrate into society. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4612.0s)]
*  They were part of that. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4616.0s)]
*  They got duped into this nonsense. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4617.0s)]
*  And so you hide it. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4619.0s)]
*  Most people, it's like it's not like you're telling people and they're laughing at you. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4620.0s)]
*  You're not telling anyone because you're scared they're going to laugh at you or judge you. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4623.0s)]
*  And so you spend your life in shame hiding this truth that honestly doesn't make you a bad person at all. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4626.0s)]
*  And probably many people would understand. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4632.0s)]
*  But you don't talk about it. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4634.0s)]
*  I didn't talk about it forever. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4635.0s)]
*  Not just that, but everybody's susceptible to it, whether you believe it or not, especially if you were a child. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4637.0s)]
*  Everybody's susceptible. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4642.0s)]
*  This ridiculous idea people have that, oh, I would have known better. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4644.0s)]
*  Like, I don't think you would. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4648.0s)]
*  I really don't. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4650.0s)]
*  I think you would now. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4651.0s)]
*  But you're new now. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4653.0s)]
*  You're you're 35 year old you. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4654.0s)]
*  You're not that you that was five years old. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4656.0s)]
*  And if that had been consistently perpetuated onto you, you wouldn't know. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4659.0s)]
*  Right. So there's a story we were raised with, which is a really common biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4663.0s)]
*  And Abraham is told to kill his son, his only son. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4668.0s)]
*  And he's told to take him up on an altar and slaughter him and the way that you would slaughter an animal. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4670.0s)]
*  And Abraham makes Isaac do this hike up to this mountain where he's going to kill him. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4676.0s)]
*  And he God has told him he must do this. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4681.0s)]
*  And so he like ties his own son on this altar and brings up the knife to kill him. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4684.0s)]
*  And like very dramatically, you know, at least the story, you know, comes and as he's plunging down the knife, an angel comes and grabs his wrist and stops. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4688.0s)]
*  And God said, I just wanted to make sure you'd really do it. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4695.0s)]
*  And this is the story I was raised on. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4698.0s)]
*  And both my parents and my grandfather were very big on like you will kill your child if God asks you to. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4700.0s)]
*  That's what you're supposed to do. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4704.0s)]
*  And I said this in the book and my brother, who, you know, we really haven't talked about these. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4706.0s)]
*  We have now. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4710.0s)]
*  But at the time, we hadn't really talked about this. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4711.0s)]
*  This is like all of a year ago. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4712.0s)]
*  And he said when he read it, he thought, no, it's not that our parents would have sacrificed this. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4714.0s)]
*  They did sacrifice us because they believed that somebody else would take care of us. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4719.0s)]
*  And we were raised very, you know, I don't know if communally is exactly the truth because it was there wasn't necessarily anyone who was checking. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4724.0s)]
*  But there was random people who a lot of in my case, a lot of men who just raised us because our parents had more important things that God told them to do. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4731.0s)]
*  And so there's a lot of ways to sacrifice kids. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4739.0s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to think that, you know, God is talking to you. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4741.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4745.0s)]
*  You could apply that to other aspects of culture. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4747.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4749.0s)]
*  It is. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4751.0s)]
*  Is there like groups of people that get together that have survived cults that have an ability to like help each other through this? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4755.0s)]
*  So apparently there are. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4764.0s)]
*  And I didn't know about this until the last year. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4765.0s)]
*  There's a whole huge group of people who have come out of like Hasidic Jews, like Orthodox Hasidic Jews. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4767.0s)]
*  But there's also Steve Hassan. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4772.0s)]
*  He's a doctor who spoke on Megyn Kelly when I was on that show, too. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4774.0s)]
*  And he has something called the bite method, which is just basically says that there's like these really four major ways of control that cults do. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4779.0s)]
*  They control your behavior, your information, your thoughts and your emotions. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4788.0s)]
*  And so he has these deep programming systems and counselors and people who can help you if you've been in that kind of high control group, even if it wasn't religious in nature. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4792.0s)]
*  You have talked to that dude before. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4803.0s)]
*  Have you talked to him? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4804.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4805.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4806.0s)]
*  It's I think he's a Mooney. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4807.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4809.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4810.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4811.0s)]
*  Yeah, his the whole thing of like his excommunication and how he got free of it. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4812.0s)]
*  When you were breaking free, what age were you? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4818.0s)]
*  Seventeen. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4823.0s)]
*  You're 17. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4824.0s)]
*  And what was it like like trying to integrate with regular people out there in the world when you were 17? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4825.0s)]
*  I don't think I did that very effectively at all. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4831.0s)]
*  So how could you? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4834.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just couldn't. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4835.0s)]
*  So I got married. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4836.0s)]
*  What was the experience like of like all of a sudden you go from being this incredibly controlling religious cult that thinks the end of the world is coming to regular world? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4837.0s)]
*  So it wasn't entirely all of a sudden. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4847.0s)]
*  I had a childhood illness, an autoimmune disease, which was probably I mean there's no genetic nature to these diseases, but where your body attacks itself. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4850.0s)]
*  So it's quite probable that my body was just like I can't take this anymore because I mean. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4858.0s)]
*  Stress. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4862.0s)]
*  And also there's a lot of deprivation, sleep deprivation, food, you know, when you're in survival training, a lot of extreme deprivation. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4863.0s)]
*  So how long does survival training go for? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4869.0s)]
*  Well, because I was born there and it also because I was sick and because of other things like I was trained for a very long time, like pretty much we moved up there full time up to the mountain, which I talk about in the book forger. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4871.0s)]
*  We moved up there when I was almost eight. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4884.0s)]
*  And so I was up there until I left and you were foraging. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4887.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4890.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4891.0s)]
*  I mean, there was other things going on too, but so I got sick and then I was hungry and there was a lot of other things happening. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4892.0s)]
*  And so I found a way to start house cleaning for people. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4897.0s)]
*  And that's how I got an application to college and stuff like that. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4900.0s)]
*  But I was a house cleaner. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4902.0s)]
*  And so that was kind of a four way, a foray into learning about how other people lived, even though like it wasn't like I was invited into their family. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4904.0s)]
*  I was invited into their things. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4912.0s)]
*  But you can learn a lot when you see a refrigerator that has food in it. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4913.0s)]
*  What was it like just cleaning people's houses, just seeing how these weird people lived in the outside world? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4917.0s)]
*  Did you ever see the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4925.0s)]
*  I did. Yeah. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4927.0s)]
*  Hilarious. So many people were like, it's you. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4928.0s)]
*  They made a show about you. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4931.0s)]
*  It's kind of you. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4932.0s)]
*  It is. And you know what? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4933.0s)]
*  That is very much the way that she's just like confused by the smallest things. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4934.0s)]
*  I mean, it's funny the way that they depict it, but it's also kind of dark. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4938.0s)]
*  I mean, I actually liked the dark humor in that. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4942.0s)]
*  It's a great show. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4944.0s)]
*  And Handmaid's Tale too. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4945.0s)]
*  I got a lot of calls about that one. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4946.0s)]
*  They made another show about you. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4948.0s)]
*  But I think that there's there's real truth to these the things that confuse that you and I didn't have any friends. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4950.0s)]
*  I went to college. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4956.0s)]
*  I didn't have I didn't know how to have relationships. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4957.0s)]
*  There's a lot of rules, apparently unspoken rules about, you know, the dance of friendship. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4960.0s)]
*  And I had never made a friend because I was born with the people I was born with. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4964.0s)]
*  And I didn't know how to do that. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4967.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4968.0s)]
*  I didn't know how to date. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4969.0s)]
*  I didn't know how to like be. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4970.0s)]
*  I didn't I didn't know any of the rules. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4972.0s)]
*  And it took me a very long time to learn them. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4974.0s)]
*  What a crazy crash course. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4976.0s)]
*  Were you open about your past? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4978.0s)]
*  No, no, absolutely not. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4980.0s)]
*  I wasn't hoping they just thought you were weird. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4982.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4984.0s)]
*  Why don't you call me an ice queen? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4985.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4987.0s)]
*  Because I was just really separate. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4989.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't know how to and I I didn't drink or smoke or do any of those things because I was so afraid of losing control. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4990.0s)]
*  I was so afraid that if I I also felt like I was in a huge hole that I had to dig my way out of in order to find a way to live in the outside world. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=4996.0s)]
*  And so I couldn't afford to like I didn't know who to trust and who not to trust. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5003.0s)]
*  And I mean, some of my friends now even and my friends have become my family and my brothers like that, too. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5007.0s)]
*  He has just the most amazing friends who are his family and they will still call me feral. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5012.0s)]
*  They're like, you don't you still don't know how to. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5018.0s)]
*  I mean, like, I still don't understand the point of utensils. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5020.0s)]
*  I mean, like, I can I can do it and I know which fork to eat from. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5023.0s)]
*  But like, I don't want to, you know, you want to eat with your fingers. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5026.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5028.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5029.0s)]
*  You know, I can eat with utensils, but it's not if I'm not in polite company. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5030.0s)]
*  I mean, with my hands. Yeah. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5035.0s)]
*  Isn't it interesting that like eating with your hands is thought to be gross? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5037.0s)]
*  But some things you have to eat with your hands. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5041.0s)]
*  Like if you're eating ribs, how you can eat ribs? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5043.0s)]
*  If you eat ribs with a fork and knife, you're a fucking asshole. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5046.0s)]
*  You got a big old Texas beef rib. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5051.0s)]
*  You have to eat that thing with your face. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5054.0s)]
*  Yeah. You have to get in there. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5056.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5057.0s)]
*  You have to use your hands. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5058.0s)]
*  Isn't it weird? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5059.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's interesting. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5060.0s)]
*  And it's just cultural. Yeah. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5061.0s)]
*  But there's something we do in Western culture because we're so in our minds instead of our bodies. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5063.0s)]
*  We're always separating ourselves. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5066.0s)]
*  So we need this like piece of metal that keeps us like from the reality that we're like fucking eating an animal or, you know, whatever it is we're devouring. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5067.0s)]
*  And somehow it's more polite if you have this piece of metal between you and it. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5075.0s)]
*  Bizarre. It is. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5078.0s)]
*  And it definitely keeps your hands cleaner. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5079.0s)]
*  You know, it's easier to pick the food up. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5081.0s)]
*  And you feel like, you know, look at me. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5084.0s)]
*  I'm in a restaurant. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5086.0s)]
*  I got a napkin tucked in here. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5087.0s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of rules. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5089.0s)]
*  You have to have that on your lap and, you know. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5090.0s)]
*  Right. And which side is a salad fork? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5092.0s)]
*  Which side? Which one's the regular fork? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5094.0s)]
*  Yeah. Starting the outside in. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5096.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5097.0s)]
*  Bizarre. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5098.0s)]
*  Yeah. So when you are learning these things, you have to like actually memorize them. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5099.0s)]
*  You know, like when you don't come from it, you're like, there's a lot of rules and all of them have systems. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5103.0s)]
*  Right. So I'm very actually fascinated by microcosms. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5109.0s)]
*  You know, like the microcosm cultures of like any sort of culture has a lot of rules attached to it. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5111.0s)]
*  Sure. Well, you must be hyper aware of that. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5117.0s)]
*  I feel like I am. Yeah. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5120.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have to be. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5121.0s)]
*  Yeah. Patterns that people just take for granted. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5122.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, interesting. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5126.0s)]
*  Yeah. Always watching. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5128.0s)]
*  The thing about like not knowing where the forks and knives go to me is one of the dumbest ones of all time. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5129.0s)]
*  Because it's like a sign that you're a cultured person. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5135.0s)]
*  If you know where the fork has to be proper. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5138.0s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5141.0s)]
*  It's class. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5142.0s)]
*  Do you want to have a boring ass conversation with a bunch of people? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5143.0s)]
*  Or do you want to sit down and have a meal and talk? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5146.0s)]
*  Like, that's the fun kind of like, what the fuck are we doing? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5149.0s)]
*  Like, who's proper? Who are we impressing? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5152.0s)]
*  Is the queen coming by? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5154.0s)]
*  Like, what is this? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5156.0s)]
*  This is why would you want this? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5157.0s)]
*  Well, haven't you experienced though that sometimes when you get rid of all that, you just have a much more intimate conversation. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5159.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5164.0s)]
*  I like to eat on the floor. I like to sit on the floor. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5165.0s)]
*  And I have this beautiful rug in my house and I'm like, if people will do it, I invite them to sit on the floor. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5166.0s)]
*  Because it just feels more organic to me. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5172.0s)]
*  And it feels earthier. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5174.0s)]
*  And it feels just like, I don't know, it just removes all the hierarchies. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5175.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen those Middle Eastern guys all sitting around an enormous plate of food? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5178.0s)]
*  And they're all just sitting cross-legged, just digging in with their hands and eating with their hands. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5184.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5189.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5190.0s)]
*  Well, if your hands are clean. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5191.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the whole idea is you never shake someone's hand with your left hand. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5192.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5194.0s)]
*  That's the hand you use to wipe your ass. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5195.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5196.0s)]
*  So they think we're gross because we use paper and we just smudge it all over the place. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5197.0s)]
*  Well. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5200.0s)]
*  And they got a point. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5201.0s)]
*  They got a really good point. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5202.0s)]
*  Like it is one of the grossest things. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5203.0s)]
*  If you get one of those bidet toilets, you will never go back. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5205.0s)]
*  You'll never go back. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5208.0s)]
*  Like how gross is it to just smear it all over the place? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5210.0s)]
*  So they have, you're allowed to eat with your hands. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5213.0s)]
*  You're supposed to eat with your hands. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5217.0s)]
*  It's just a normal thing. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5218.0s)]
*  Like most of the time it's normal. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5219.0s)]
*  How do you eat popcorn? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5221.0s)]
*  Do you use a spoon? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5222.0s)]
*  I feel so validated right now. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5223.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5224.0s)]
*  How do you eat popcorn? [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5225.0s)]
*  Do you eat popcorn? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5226.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5227.0s)]
*  Well, do you eat with your fucking hands? [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5228.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5229.0s)]
*  And bread. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5230.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5231.0s)]
*  Bread. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5232.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5233.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5234.0s)]
*  Bread. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5235.0s)]
*  Who's cutting bread with a fork and knife? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5236.0s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5237.0s)]
*  You eat with your hands. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5238.0s)]
*  I guess it's just the messiness of it. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5239.0s)]
*  But I think if you can get people to act proper, like the conversations that you like stay [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5241.0s)]
*  within the lines. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5245.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5246.0s)]
*  You know, maybe that's it. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5247.0s)]
*  Maybe, you know, if you go to an inn and everybody's eating chicken legs and drinking beer and [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5248.0s)]
*  they're going to have crazy stories. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5252.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5253.0s)]
*  It's going to get uncomfortable. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5254.0s)]
*  Just keep people, make them wear their nicest clothes so they don't want to get messy and [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5255.0s)]
*  give them a fork and a knife and keep everybody proper. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5259.0s)]
*  And everyone's trying to impress everybody else with how proper they are and how much [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5262.0s)]
*  they know about fine dining. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5265.0s)]
*  May I see this sommelier to make a wine selection? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5267.0s)]
*  You know, all of it. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5271.0s)]
*  It's like. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5272.0s)]
*  I remember the first time, you know, someone came to pour this glass of wine or whatever. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5273.0s)]
*  And then the guy is supposed to like take a sip of it to tell the guy if it's okay. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5276.0s)]
*  And I'm like, what kind of culture is this? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5281.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, also, and what are you going to say if it's not? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5283.0s)]
*  Like, what kind of. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5285.0s)]
*  By the way, that is the most bullshitty, bullshitty moment you ever have in a restaurant. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5286.0s)]
*  You swirl that thing around, take a sniff and sip. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5292.0s)]
*  Unless you really know what you're doing. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5295.0s)]
*  Ninety nine point nine percent of the people doing that have no fucking idea what they're [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5297.0s)]
*  doing. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5300.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5301.0s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5302.0s)]
*  I don't know if this is a fact, but I have never had anyone offer it to me. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5303.0s)]
*  They always offer it to the man. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5306.0s)]
*  And the man decides whether or not it's a wine good enough for the lady. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5307.0s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5310.0s)]
*  No, I've definitely seen women get it. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5311.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5313.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5314.0s)]
*  If a woman orders a bottle of wine, it's generally like whoever orders it. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5315.0s)]
*  I've seen that. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5318.0s)]
*  OK, I'm going to watch. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5319.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5320.0s)]
*  But I think maybe that's just modern today. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5321.0s)]
*  Maybe that's like a new thing. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5323.0s)]
*  You know, women's liberation stuff like people don't want to be resumptuous. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5325.0s)]
*  So they'll offer the woman a taste. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5328.0s)]
*  No one has ever offered me a taste. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5330.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5332.0s)]
*  Even if you've ordered the bottle. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5333.0s)]
*  Maybe I've never ordered a bottle. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5334.0s)]
*  Maybe that's what it is. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5335.0s)]
*  I think it's generally the person who orders it. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5336.0s)]
*  That may be. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5339.0s)]
*  But I also wouldn't have any idea if that was. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5340.0s)]
*  Because if I'm around a group of my friends and we order a bottle of wine, if I ask, they always bring it to me. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5342.0s)]
*  But if one of my friends asks, they always bring it to them. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5348.0s)]
*  I think it's generally the person who orders it. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5350.0s)]
*  I think, but I don't know. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5353.0s)]
*  I think it's probably just rules. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5354.0s)]
*  But I would imagine that like women get offered less. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5356.0s)]
*  I would imagine if I was like an old school sommelier, I would assume the lady would not be making the choice. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5362.0s)]
*  Do you know anything about Sikhs? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5366.0s)]
*  Sikhs, the religion? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5368.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5369.0s)]
*  Not too much. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5370.0s)]
*  Which is really more culture than a religion. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5371.0s)]
*  But this is about wine. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5372.0s)]
*  I didn't change the subject. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5374.0s)]
*  So they have this, they do not drink unless the person they are with is drinking and they don't want to be rude or whatever. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5375.0s)]
*  So they're not allowed to order wine. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5382.0s)]
*  But if you order wine and you pour it for them, they can drink. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5384.0s)]
*  And that's the same thing about smoking. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5387.0s)]
*  They also never cut their hair. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5389.0s)]
*  I have a Sikh friend and he taught me. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5390.0s)]
*  I couldn't figure it out at the beginning because I'd be like, why does he keep asking me to order? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5393.0s)]
*  He'd be like, you order. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5396.0s)]
*  I said, no, no, you order. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5397.0s)]
*  I don't know what I want. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5398.0s)]
*  You know, like whatever. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5399.0s)]
*  And he'd be like, no, no, you need to order the bottle of wine. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5400.0s)]
*  And he, if I ordered it, even though he told me to order it and he was paying for it, then he could drink it. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5402.0s)]
*  What a goofy rule. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5409.0s)]
*  What a workaround. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5411.0s)]
*  So that's the thing. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5412.0s)]
*  I mean, there's just all these cultures have different traditions. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5413.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5416.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5417.0s)]
*  Do you know what Sikhs do have? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5418.0s)]
*  They have this crazy yogurt cannabis mixture. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5419.0s)]
*  I did not. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5423.0s)]
*  That's supposed to be bomb diggity. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5424.0s)]
*  What is that stuff called, Jamie? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5426.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5428.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5429.0s)]
*  Duncan taught me about it. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5430.0s)]
*  Like they have had it. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5431.0s)]
*  No, they have some like edible THC yogurt thing that's supposed to be insane. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5433.0s)]
*  He's given it to you. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5439.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5440.0s)]
*  Many different ways of making bong lassi. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5441.0s)]
*  The traditional method is to blend fresh cannabis leaves, plain yogurt, a pinch of sugar and nuts like almonds and pistachios, along with spices and ginger powder, fennel seeds, cardamom and peppercorn and water. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5444.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5459.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5460.0s)]
*  That's concoction. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5461.0s)]
*  Click on that. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5462.0s)]
*  What does it say at the top? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5463.0s)]
*  Oh, wait, why have you not tried this? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5464.0s)]
*  The world's oldest cannabis treat. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5465.0s)]
*  Yeah, I probably should try it. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5467.0s)]
*  I think you should. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5468.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5469.0s)]
*  But I guess these guys take that stuff and get blasted. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5470.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5474.0s)]
*  It's a really old and rich tradition and they are very humble and kind people. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5475.0s)]
*  The culture, very pacifist and etc, etc. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5480.0s)]
*  But probably that's what they've been doing. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5483.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're chilling. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5485.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5486.0s)]
*  They're in a good headspace. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5487.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5489.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5490.0s)]
*  It's like so that's an example of a group of humans following a pattern that seems to be beneficial. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5491.0s)]
*  It seems to like they've got a harmonious relationship with each other. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5497.0s)]
*  They do, but their work around, we can joke about the work around, but the thing their [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5500.0s)]
*  work around does means that when they associate with outsiders, they don't stick to their [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5503.0s)]
*  own custom. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5506.0s)]
*  They accept the customs of the outsider. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5507.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5509.0s)]
*  And they work around it by the other person having the order. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5510.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5512.0s)]
*  But they participate in it. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5513.0s)]
*  And because they participate in it, they don't keep themselves as narrow minded. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5514.0s)]
*  I mean, cult people, they're definitely, no matter who pours you that glass of wine, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5517.0s)]
*  you're not allowed to drink it. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5520.0s)]
*  My dad was in the military and he was drafted, but he was like, no one could get into the [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5521.0s)]
*  military. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5526.0s)]
*  No one could get me to drink a sip of alcohol, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5527.0s)]
*  He was very proud of his ability to be separate. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5530.0s)]
*  And so it's really difficult to have friendships in a cult, by the way. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5533.0s)]
*  You think that it's so great because you're all in unison, but one of the things that [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5535.0s)]
*  people who have gotten out, maybe they still have family members there, is that the people [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5539.0s)]
*  who are left there, they don't have any real friends because anybody would report on anybody. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5542.0s)]
*  There's no loyalty. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5547.0s)]
*  You can't tell a joke. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5548.0s)]
*  You can't laugh at a joke. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5549.0s)]
*  You can't like, there's really a lot of things that are forbidden that are, I think, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5550.0s)]
*  required for friendship. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5554.0s)]
*  And so I had to learn that when I got on the outside. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5555.0s)]
*  And I look back and I think I was really impoverished by knowing people and moving in unison and [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5557.0s)]
*  having comfort, but not really having the experience of trust. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5563.0s)]
*  And so how did you, how long did it take and what steps did you go about to sort of like [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5567.0s)]
*  create your own version of the world? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5576.0s)]
*  I feel like there's really good ways to do this and I did not do any of them. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5580.0s)]
*  I mean, I was in college, so I, you know, whatever, I learned things academically. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5587.0s)]
*  But what I didn't learn is like in my body. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5592.0s)]
*  I feel like I had four children really quickly, really young. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5595.0s)]
*  And then I think I raised myself with them. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5599.0s)]
*  I used to do this thing when my babies were little where I was reading about other cultures [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5602.0s)]
*  because I didn't know, I didn't even know like what an American culture really was. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5607.0s)]
*  And so I like read about Japan, for example, which at the time they were saying basically, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5611.0s)]
*  you don't say no to a child until they're five because you want to give them a sense of [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5614.0s)]
*  autonomy and then you start putting the structure there. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5617.0s)]
*  So anyway, I had these index cards and I put them all over my house and they said that they had [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5619.0s)]
*  the values that I wanted for my kids, like resiliency, humor, agency, whatever. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5623.0s)]
*  And so, and then on the back I would put the techniques. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5629.0s)]
*  So for example, I didn't put restraints. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5632.0s)]
*  Like I didn't use play pins or whatever. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5635.0s)]
*  I just tried to create a safe environment. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5638.0s)]
*  And then I did these things like they should be able to find me, but I shouldn't always be present. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5640.0s)]
*  So I would say, hi, I'm going to be working right here in this room, like to a one year old. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5643.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5647.0s)]
*  Anytime you want me, I'm right here. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5648.0s)]
*  But then like remove myself from sight so they felt that they were in control of the relationship [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5650.0s)]
*  and just all this stuff. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5653.0s)]
*  But I did it so cerebrally, you know. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5655.0s)]
*  And so I think by raising them, I raised myself. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5657.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5660.0s)]
*  But it did take me a long time to have friends, though. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5662.0s)]
*  I don't think I had friends till my 30s because like any genuine friends, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5664.0s)]
*  because I didn't know how to be vulnerable and I didn't trust anyone. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5667.0s)]
*  Like I would be friends with somebody for like six, seven years before I'd mentioned anything about where I came from. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5670.0s)]
*  So how did you figure out how to open up? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5676.0s)]
*  I'm still working on it. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5680.0s)]
*  Still working on it? I think you're doing great. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5682.0s)]
*  I'm trying it with you, Joe. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5684.0s)]
*  Well, just the fact that you could, the way you communicate about it, you're so open about it. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5686.0s)]
*  And I mean, I can't imagine what that's like. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5689.0s)]
*  I can't imagine what that life is like, what your childhood was like with being 17 and just being out in the world on your own, [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5694.0s)]
*  trying to decipher what the fuck the outside world does. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5702.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I didn't understand parents either, like people's relationships with their parents. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5706.0s)]
*  Like I didn't ever have, like my dad never bought me a meal in my life. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5711.0s)]
*  Like he never, even later in life when I reconnected or whatever, it's like I would always have to pay. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5715.0s)]
*  There was never this sense that my parents were giving us, you know, like it was always us giving to them. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5719.0s)]
*  And I felt like I didn't understand. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5726.0s)]
*  I feel like I still have a little struggle with like, why are they taking such good care of you? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5729.0s)]
*  You know, it's like this, I don't know, it disconnects as far as what it looks like to be a family. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5733.0s)]
*  And my definition of family is whiter than biology, of course. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5738.0s)]
*  Right. Because like your grandfather wasn't really your grandfather, right? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5742.0s)]
*  He was. He was your grandfather. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5745.0s)]
*  He actually was my biological grandfather, but the other kids that we were raised with all called him grandpa. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5746.0s)]
*  Right. And so I didn't know the difference. But he was my actual. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5751.0s)]
*  So there was a lot of people that were family, but they weren't related. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5754.0s)]
*  Right. And then of course, once I left, I had to make new family as well. And then my friendships with my family. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5758.0s)]
*  Well, it makes sense that it would take you into your 30s because like you have to relearn life. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5765.0s)]
*  So you're going through one through 17 again. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5768.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It takes you that many that much more time. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5771.0s)]
*  Did you see the movie Poor Things? No. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5774.0s)]
*  OK. Well, just this idea that if you put like a child's brain in a adult body, that like that's what that story's about. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5776.0s)]
*  It's kind of like a Frankenstein sort of thing. Who's in that movie? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5785.0s)]
*  Emma Stone. I'm a stone. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5788.0s)]
*  Is it a recent movie? Yes. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5790.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of those like she did. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5792.0s)]
*  Like I pay attention. But it's not about religion. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5795.0s)]
*  Well, she does call. She calls the guy God who created her because his last name is Godwin. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5797.0s)]
*  I think it's Godwin. Right, Jamie. But it's she calls him God. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5802.0s)]
*  So there's like a religious parable, but it's not specifically about religion. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5805.0s)]
*  But I think that's what I was like. I was like a which I feel like I'm still recovering from. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5809.0s)]
*  But what year is this supposed to be taking place in? [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5814.0s)]
*  It's surrealistic. So it's kind of Victorian, but it's sensationalized. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5817.0s)]
*  It's almost like Diego Rivera crossed with like, oh, yeah, I could see part of it's in black and white. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5823.0s)]
*  And then she starts seeing in color. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5830.0s)]
*  How do I not know about this? I don't know how you don't know. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5832.0s)]
*  I'm so out of the loop. There's just too many things to pay attention to. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5835.0s)]
*  I feel like I just taught you something. You definitely did. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5838.0s)]
*  But there's just too many things to pay attention to today. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5840.0s)]
*  Yeah, there are. There are too many. But in any case, it's an adult brain put in. I mean, sorry, a child's brain. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5843.0s)]
*  It's actually her unborn fetus that gets put into this body. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5849.0s)]
*  She she dies. And so the baby dies and then or the baby doesn't quite die. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5852.0s)]
*  So that that brain gets put into this adult woman. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5857.0s)]
*  But in any case, that's what I felt like. Wow. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5859.0s)]
*  I felt like I was this adult body who just had an infant brain. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5862.0s)]
*  And I and there was just and I think it just took me so long. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5867.0s)]
*  So I don't come from I feel like I don't come from an era to like kind of like the way that the movie is depicted. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5869.0s)]
*  It felt like like there was no music of I don't relate to the music of my generation because I never heard it. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5875.0s)]
*  And so people, you know, like people are just sort of like everyone should sort of like the same kind of thing. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5880.0s)]
*  And I don't have it never I didn't go to concerts when I was a teenager ever. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5884.0s)]
*  I never so I didn't have any idea what that felt like. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5888.0s)]
*  And so I don't associate with that with youth, for example. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5891.0s)]
*  Did you guys listen to any music? I sang a lot of hymns, hymns, a lot of hymns, mostly just Christian hymns, all Christian hymns. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5894.0s)]
*  But John Wesley, there was a lot of I don't know if you know who John Wesley is, but he wrote a lot of hymns and, you know, like in the I think 1600s. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5903.0s)]
*  Can you fact check that, Jamie? But it was he wrote so many songs and I knew all the lyrics to those. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5910.0s)]
*  I knew how to sing in harmony. And so when you were kids, like we guys would rock out, just rock out and sing hymns. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5917.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, pretty much. So when was the first time you heard another song? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5924.0s)]
*  You know, the thing that I got ultimately kicked out for was going to a movie with a boy who was raised with me. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5930.0s)]
*  He was a young man. He had left and he was a college kid and I was 17. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5938.0s)]
*  And I went to the Color Purple and there was music in that. And I. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5943.0s)]
*  Were you allowed to see movies? No. Had you seen one before? No. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5949.0s)]
*  Color Purple is the first movie you ever saw? To my knowledge, yes. Wow. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5954.0s)]
*  So that really changed my life. And then I started watching movies when I got to college. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5958.0s)]
*  What was it like going to a movie at 17 for the first time? Magic. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5961.0s)]
*  Like a like a like the most beautiful church. It was so beautiful. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5966.0s)]
*  It was like it was I mean, just the darkness and then the way that the screen lit up and I just it was so beautiful. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5972.0s)]
*  I think we take it for granted, right? Yeah, it just made me cry. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5981.0s)]
*  You're wild. But and that was the first time you heard other music, too. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5986.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so I didn't start listening to popular music that took me a while to like acclimate even once I got out. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5991.0s)]
*  Like I knew that other people were doing it. But the first time like I maybe bought a CD, for example, I think I was 30. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=5997.0s)]
*  Wow. Like I just didn't because I had babies young. I just didn't. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6004.0s)]
*  I did all that in my early 20s. I had all these little kids and I was doing, you know, the mom thing and trying to get myself educated so I could, you know, make good money and take care of everybody. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6008.0s)]
*  And it just felt like there wasn't time for that. So I didn't have a youth. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6018.0s)]
*  And so I met a music critic when I was in my 30s. I'm actually putting this in my next book, which is actually called Prodigal Daughter. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6022.0s)]
*  And he introduced me to the songs of it was in the early 2000s and he introduced me to the songs of the 90s and taught me like, you know, the derivations of, you know, these the beats and the lyrics. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6029.0s)]
*  And he had come from a pastor father. So he understood, you know, religion in relation to music. And it was just this wonderful music education. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6041.0s)]
*  So I did all that. I mean, I really think I came into understanding music in my 30s. You're like almost like an alien. Yes, very much. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6048.0s)]
*  Like an alien version of a human being that they dropped off at 17 years old. Like what? [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6056.0s)]
*  It just it's shocking to me how long it takes to figure it out. Even when you think like you can learn to you know what it is. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6062.0s)]
*  I could learn to code switch and I could learn to be presentable on the outside. Like I could learn which fork to use like really quickly that you can learn. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6070.0s)]
*  But you can't learn to feel the other things that other people feel. Right. And so you're always just a little bit disconnected as like being kind of in a bell jar or something like there's always a distance between or there was for just a long time between me and someone else. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6078.0s)]
*  And so, for example, my brother who loves you, as I told you, he I went to his birthday party recently and they're like, you have a sister like he never even talked about his family. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6090.0s)]
*  They didn't even know. He's like, yeah, she just wrote a book. You should like read it so you could figure out who where I come from, you know, because he never told his very best friends who he had been like friends with for over 20 years. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6098.0s)]
*  Like he never told them. And I think that, you know, and he he looks really normal, you know, like he has. But he didn't have the ability, I think, to really to really maybe gauge the way that it affected him. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6107.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we as a family, you know, the siblings all kind of went different directions because like it's painful to go back and relive it. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6121.0s)]
*  And you don't it just feels like you're always going backwards if you try to be around where you come from. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6129.0s)]
*  And you just want to you just want to like live in the world and, you know, find a new identity. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6134.0s)]
*  Wow. So there's long term consequences for coming out of something like this. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6140.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. How could it not be? Yeah. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6145.0s)]
*  I mean, just there's so many things that can happen to a child when they're young that will screw them up forever. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6149.0s)]
*  But the fact that you had no understanding of the outside world and you fully believed all this stuff that you were being told, you learn how to forage and survive in the woods. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6154.0s)]
*  And then you get released and then you're out in the world because you want to see the color purple. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6167.0s)]
*  Crazy. It's such a crazy story. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6173.0s)]
*  But the outside world is really complicated because there's so many different belief systems out here. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6178.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Did you were you at a rush to try to find a new one? [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6185.0s)]
*  I was in a rush for everything because I didn't think I was going to live very long because I was still inside my head that I was a breaking. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6191.0s)]
*  I mean, even now, like, to be honest, writing about this, this is what the former field people have said to me all the time. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6197.0s)]
*  It's like nobody's ever talked about this publicly. We were we're trained, you know, like once you're in the field, you're always in the field. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6203.0s)]
*  Like it's like being a Marine or something like these are our brothers and sisters in arms and you never allowed to talk about this. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6209.0s)]
*  So to come out with the book, it was the first time that anyone has spoken publicly about this particular cult. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6215.0s)]
*  And I was raised, of course, to believe I'd be struck dead by lightning if I ever talked about it. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6221.0s)]
*  And so there were so many years that I think it was just so painful to even think about. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6226.0s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, where I come from. So I'm kind of going around a circle to answer this question. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6233.0s)]
*  But it felt like it's been very recent that I can own that as being an essential part of my identity. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6239.0s)]
*  Wow. How did you do you attribute to any specific like, is it meditation? Is it yoga? [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6247.0s)]
*  Like, what is it that sort of has allowed you to kind of regain your life? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6256.0s)]
*  Have you heard the expression or that the word biophilia? No. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6263.0s)]
*  So biophilia is the love of living things, and it's not specifically environmental. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6267.0s)]
*  It was coined in 1973, I think, by Eric Fromm, and it is the love of living things. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6272.0s)]
*  So it's not just humans, but it's animals, plants, whatever. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6277.0s)]
*  And so I think that because I was raised understanding the natural environment, I really feel like when I've been lost in the world, you know, and or you think you're lost, I don't know if we can ever truly be lost. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6280.0s)]
*  I think that we're just learning what's around us that isn't working. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6292.0s)]
*  Like, that's always information that can if if you know what to look for, there's always information that can get you where you want to go. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6296.0s)]
*  You just need to know where you want to go. Right. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6302.0s)]
*  So I feel like putting my feet in the dirt. So, you know, kind of like, you know, but like being in my body and being on the earth. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6305.0s)]
*  And I think yoga helps with that, even if you're not doing it on the grass, although I do teach outside sometimes. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6311.0s)]
*  But like, if you can find yourself like what you're connected to, that feels solid. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6315.0s)]
*  That feels like something you can believe in. Right. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6320.0s)]
*  Because it's not about an idea. It's like I am held by gravity right now. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6322.0s)]
*  Like this gravity is holding me into the earth and this earth. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6326.0s)]
*  Like it is capable of nurturing seeds. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6329.0s)]
*  Like things grow out of this earth. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6332.0s)]
*  Like we forget that, I think, sometimes in our contemporary culture that everything comes out of the earth. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6334.0s)]
*  And so I think that one of the practices I do meditate, but I meditated before I got came here today. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6339.0s)]
*  But I think that like if I can be under a tree, you know, and like on the earth in some way, then I feel like that, I guess, is that neuroplasticity thing. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6345.0s)]
*  Like I can always grow. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6355.0s)]
*  Like there's that there's no point at which I'm separate. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6357.0s)]
*  And I think there's that part of practice of being like, no, I'm truly connected. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6361.0s)]
*  And all the things they taught me was a way of keeping me separate. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6364.0s)]
*  But I can always go back to the source itself. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6368.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think when we were talking about the sky and the light pollution being a spiritual deficiency, I think we have that also from the forests. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6370.0s)]
*  I think there's something that connects us when we're in the wilderness. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6380.0s)]
*  There's a feeling that you get when there's a humbleness that comes about you, a humility that you have to accept that the wilderness is so vast and powerful and amazing that it puts you in check. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6383.0s)]
*  It gives you like this feeling of connectedness to everything. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6397.0s)]
*  We think when we're living in cities and we're getting Ubers and we're going to restaurants, we think we're disconnected from nature because we've kind of set it up that way. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6400.0s)]
*  We set our own little hamster wheel up over nature. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6409.0s)]
*  But we're missing something by doing that. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6412.0s)]
*  We're missing our nature. Yeah, we really are. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6416.0s)]
*  Like we are nature. We just create our forks. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6418.0s)]
*  I'll just go back to that metaphor and that literal thing. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6421.0s)]
*  But we separate ourselves from the reality that we eat straight from the earth. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6424.0s)]
*  And most people, they eat animals that are alive on the earth. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6428.0s)]
*  And that thing was a living creature. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6431.0s)]
*  And you are devouring it. And that is so primal. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6433.0s)]
*  Yeah, life eats life. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6436.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we all come from the wilderness. We really do. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6437.0s)]
*  For hundreds of thousands of years, we were way, way... [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6440.0s)]
*  I mean, it's astronomically longer that we spent foraging than we did civilization. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6444.0s)]
*  Yeah, with an agriculture. I mean, agriculture is relatively new. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6450.0s)]
*  And so we all come from that. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6453.0s)]
*  So when we get there, I think it is something that is inside of us. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6455.0s)]
*  And I think we would all benefit. At least I benefit. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6458.0s)]
*  I shouldn't preach this to anyone else. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6462.0s)]
*  But I think we benefit when we connect to it. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6464.0s)]
*  I think all human beings share that. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6466.0s)]
*  The only people that... you have to be like really, really neurotic and like a crazy city dweller. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6468.0s)]
*  Like, get me out of the woods. I ate it out here. It's so quiet. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6472.0s)]
*  There are a lot of people who are like that. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6477.0s)]
*  They're out there smoking cigarettes. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6478.0s)]
*  Bobby, when we fucking going home, this is terrible. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6480.0s)]
*  There's got to be people like that. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6483.0s)]
*  There are. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6485.0s)]
*  People that are just like... [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6486.0s)]
*  There are people that get acclimated to those particular cultures too, right? [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6487.0s)]
*  There's people that maybe there's a thing that they do in their city that they can't be without. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6490.0s)]
*  And they need that thing. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6494.0s)]
*  They think they need it. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6496.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh yeah, for sure. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6497.0s)]
*  But like gambling addicts. I have a friend who's a gambling addict, lives in Vegas. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6499.0s)]
*  I'm never leaving Vegas. Because he wants to gamble all the time. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6502.0s)]
*  If that's the place, you know, that's the place for you. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6506.0s)]
*  You can't get that guy to live in the woods. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6510.0s)]
*  You know, there's no card games out there. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6512.0s)]
*  No, but there's a lot of adrenaline if you're looking for it. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6514.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. It's a different kind of adrenaline. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6516.0s)]
*  But it's also... there's a lot, like I said, the humility that the woods give you. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6518.0s)]
*  First of all, it's so hard to just get around. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6523.0s)]
*  It's fucking hard to get around. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6526.0s)]
*  Where there's no roads and shit and everything's up and down. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6528.0s)]
*  Yeah, your GPS doesn't work. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6531.0s)]
*  Yeah. But you actually can get GPS out there. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6532.0s)]
*  Not everywhere. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6535.0s)]
*  Handheld. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6536.0s)]
*  Not everywhere. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6537.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6538.0s)]
*  Well, I suppose if you have a specific device, but your phone is not going to work in plenty of places. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6539.0s)]
*  I wonder. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6542.0s)]
*  Oh, I know. I know there's places phones don't work. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6543.0s)]
*  But the new phones, don't new phones use actual global positioning satellites so that it works even without a cell phone signal? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6545.0s)]
*  I think iPhones do that. I think Samsung phones do that too. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6552.0s)]
*  Not everywhere, do they? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6556.0s)]
*  I think they do. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6557.0s)]
*  It's very limited. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6559.0s)]
*  Is it limited? [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6560.0s)]
*  Like you can send one, not like one, but like if you're stuck. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6561.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. You misunderstand what I'm saying. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6564.0s)]
*  No, you misunderstand what I'm saying. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6566.0s)]
*  Yeah, there is satellite messaging. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6568.0s)]
*  But what I'm saying is GPS coordinates that your maps work. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6570.0s)]
*  I think your maps still work even if you don't have cell phone signal. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6575.0s)]
*  You can't put in, I can tell you this. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6579.0s)]
*  If you're in a forest, it's not going to tell you which way to go because it hasn't been mapped in that way. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6581.0s)]
*  Like it's not going to tell you turn left in 50 yards. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6588.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. Yeah, right. You get GPS but you don't get directions. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6591.0s)]
*  You won't get directions. You're going to have to trust something else. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6595.0s)]
*  Siri, tell me how to get home. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6598.0s)]
*  Right. So you're going to have to find some other ways to identify. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6600.0s)]
*  Yeah, you'll have to actually look at the terrain on your GPS unit and figure out which way to go. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6604.0s)]
*  Yes, you can pull it up. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6609.0s)]
*  But you can pick a waypoint and it'll actually steer you towards a waypoint. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6611.0s)]
*  And what if you don't have your device on you? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6614.0s)]
*  You're fucked. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6616.0s)]
*  No, no, you can actually, you can actually. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6618.0s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. I mean, you're fucked. I'm fucked. You're not fucked. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6621.0s)]
*  An iPhone's GPS will work fine without cell phone coverage. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6625.0s)]
*  Your phone will know where it is but you will not be able to see your location displayed on Apple Maps without a data connection to download the map. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6629.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6638.0s)]
*  That makes it a little bit tough to get a phone. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6639.0s)]
*  So it knows where you are. The GPS will work fine. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6642.0s)]
*  But so could you just download the map of the entire country and leave it on your phone? [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6645.0s)]
*  So I know you can do that with certain apps like there's Onyx, Onyx Hunt. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6650.0s)]
*  It's a map application for wilderness hunters. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6657.0s)]
*  And you can use that and you download areas and you have them regardless of cell phone service so you can tell where you're at. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6662.0s)]
*  That may work but most people on this planet have not done that. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6668.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're fucked. If you don't know where the North Star is, you don't know how to figure out what North, South, East and West, yeah, you're in trouble. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6672.0s)]
*  You don't know where the sun rises and sets. Some people don't even know. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6679.0s)]
*  No, you're right. They don't. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6682.0s)]
*  They don't even know. They have no idea. A lot of people live in the city. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6683.0s)]
*  Which way does the sun set? North? I don't fucking know. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6686.0s)]
*  They don't know. Probably North. And they just start going that. They think they're going North. They're going deeper into the woods. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6689.0s)]
*  And you know another thing about like going deeper in the woods, like humans are prone to circular movement. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6694.0s)]
*  So if you don't know that, you will just keep walking in circles. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6698.0s)]
*  And so you could see the North and you could keep walking like kind of towards it, but you're going to veer slightly and you're going to find yourself right back where you came from. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6702.0s)]
*  Not good. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6709.0s)]
*  It's not good. And you have to figure out a strategy to keep yourself from doing that because you will naturally, they've done all sorts of studies on this and humans walk in circles. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6710.0s)]
*  Why do they do that? [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6718.0s)]
*  That's what we do. I don't know. Why do we do that? It's something in our brain. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6719.0s)]
*  We don't really understand what it is to walk in a straight line. You could get real prodigal son about that too I think. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6723.0s)]
*  Getting lost in the woods has to be one of the most terrifying experiences. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6730.0s)]
*  Do you know what you should do if you get lost in the woods? What? The first thing you should do is stop moving. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6734.0s)]
*  Stop moving. Stay put. Yeah, stay put. You really need to create a shelter and come up with a plan. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6739.0s)]
*  You really, just walking around, you're not going to get out. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6744.0s)]
*  Yeah, people have died. I mean, you probably heard this, but like on the Appalachian Trail and stuff, they'll go off the trail for like 10 feet or something to pee. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6747.0s)]
*  But it's like in a bush or whatever and then they lose track of where the trail is and they will die 20 feet away from the trail because they moved around and they exerted all their energy and whatever. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6754.0s)]
*  If they had just stayed put and waited for the sunrise and did, you know, whatever. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6764.0s)]
*  And then they figured out a system like by watching the sky or if they had your, we should all download all the maps. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6768.0s)]
*  Make sure we have GPS on our phones. But, you know, people just, I mean, there's all these stories. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6774.0s)]
*  My daughter was telling me that one of the nurses, and she's so capable, she and her sister took her daughter, so it was like the two sisters, so the aunt and the mother and the teenage daughter. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6780.0s)]
*  And they were staying away. Like they were camping. And they went just on a little like a little hike out, you know, right next to the campground. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6788.0s)]
*  And her husband knew which campground she was at. They died just 100 yards away because they didn't have any idea how to do basic survival. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6795.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6804.0s)]
*  Actually, the teenager lived because the mother and the aunt gave her all their clothes and they covered her and everything and she survived. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6805.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6810.0s)]
*  Yeah, horrible stories. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6811.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6812.0s)]
*  The things that people don't know about the wilderness. So stay put. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6813.0s)]
*  If you're not good at this. Yeah, there's a lot of tragic stories. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6816.0s)]
*  Jesus, it's so it's so unforgiving out there. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6819.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6824.0s)]
*  And so many people have no idea how to even navigate. And you can't, most people are out of shape. You can't even walk up hills. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6825.0s)]
*  There's that too. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6832.0s)]
*  You get stuck out there, you're fucked. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6833.0s)]
*  But we survived as a species out there. So the thing is, it really is about knowledge. And I mean, living a city would be impossible for prehistoric people too. Like just, I mean, cars are so fast. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6835.0s)]
*  Like how do we avoid getting hit? [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6845.0s)]
*  They would get mugged so quick. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6846.0s)]
*  Yeah, they would definitely get mugged. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6847.0s)]
*  If they had a car, they wouldn't lock it. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6851.0s)]
*  They would never figure out how to drive a car. No one's going to teach them. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6853.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. It would be so I mean, you imagine moving at those speeds. But the point is you can understand the wilderness, but people don't. And then in a sense, they're not humble enough, right? They don't understand that there's something terrifying if you don't know what you're facing. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6856.0s)]
*  And it's interesting that the disconnect from nature that we get with cities enables people to create things where you don't need nature anymore. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6870.0s)]
*  Where you, the supermarkets, trucks, all those inventions, everything's coming out of cities, and it's all getting constructed, built, put together by a group of people living in cities. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6879.0s)]
*  And it all comes from nature, but nobody sees that because it's so many steps removed. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6888.0s)]
*  Right. But whatever it does, it removes you further and further from nature. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6893.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6897.0s)]
*  I feel like all the things that we make remove us further and further from nature, shield us from nature. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6898.0s)]
*  I feel like a lot of the high control group culty things is as far removed from nature as possible too. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6903.0s)]
*  I mean, like my mom was really an exception in this way. My dad didn't learn the survival stuff. It was just my mom. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6908.0s)]
*  But there's this idea, I think, that if we could understand our true nature, we'd be a lot less susceptible to all sorts of control. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6913.0s)]
*  Because we would understand that we don't have control and that no human who professes to have the ultimate wisdom could possibly have it because we would be so attached to understand. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6922.0s)]
*  I mean, the cycles of nature, everything is prey and predator and everything's part of a much larger system. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6932.0s)]
*  And if you saw yourself as part of that, it would be really hard to fully believe any one person could be the son of God in today's age. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6937.0s)]
*  Like if they professed to be the prophet or whatever, you would have a lot more cynicism, I think, if you understood nature. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6946.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6952.0s)]
*  We're just so removed from it. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6953.0s)]
*  We're very removed from it. And that's also a problem of protecting your kids. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6954.0s)]
*  Then your kids aren't going to meet a bunch of creepy people where they could recognize creepy people in the future. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6959.0s)]
*  I met a lot of fucking psychos. I see them coming. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6965.0s)]
*  I go, I know what you look like. I've seen one of you before. You're out of your fucking mind. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6970.0s)]
*  And if you don't know that and you're a 17 year old kid who just gets released from a cult because you went to color purple, all of a sudden you're out there in the world. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6974.0s)]
*  How did you figure out who to trust? [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6983.0s)]
*  Oh, it took me a long time. In fact, I've been physically assaulted. I mean, I've been physically assaulted by people I had no idea were dangerous. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6985.0s)]
*  Like you were some guy and he's like, oh, I'm having this backyard barbecue or whatever. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6993.0s)]
*  And then there's nobody else there and you don't know to leave. You're just like in the backyard and he grabs you. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=6997.0s)]
*  I mean, my bones have been broken. I've had because I didn't understand. I mean, I could fight back to whatever degree. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7002.0s)]
*  But I also you can't fight to get back about somebody who's two or three times your size. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7007.0s)]
*  You know, it's just really difficult. But I didn't know the people were dangerous. Right. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7011.0s)]
*  Right. Were dangerous in that way. Right. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7015.0s)]
*  Wow. So it takes God. What a wild experience. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7018.0s)]
*  That would make a hell of a movie, you know, because like the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is like really funny. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7023.0s)]
*  Yeah. But like a real more fun when it's funny. Yeah. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7029.0s)]
*  Well, he she's hilarious. That shows hilarious. It is. I really love the gay guy, the roommate. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7032.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. What's his name again? I don't remember. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7037.0s)]
*  It's been a while since I saw it shows excellent. Yeah. Funny show. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7040.0s)]
*  Well, I did. So after Forger came out, I was approached to do like a creative shopping agreement, whatever. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7044.0s)]
*  So I did write a screenplay for Forger that is different than the book, but it is about all of this. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7049.0s)]
*  So we'll see what comes of it. Well, I hope they make a movie out of it because it's it's such an insane story. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7055.0s)]
*  It's just kudos to you for getting through it and becoming the person who's sitting in front of me today. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7061.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's a wild ride. Yeah. It's been it's been a long journey. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7067.0s)]
*  But it's it's nice to be on this side of it. I'll tell you how many cults are active right now in the country. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7072.0s)]
*  Do we know? No, we certainly don't know. But there is such a thing as a cult directory, which you had mentioned to that. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7080.0s)]
*  So when I was on, I did a local television right at the beginning when the book came out, Frank Buckley and the woman who was his producer. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7084.0s)]
*  He was asking at the end, it's like, oh, you know, I didn't know this cult existed. How did I not know? [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7092.0s)]
*  And she said, well, I did my fact checking before we booked her. And it's in the cult directory. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7096.0s)]
*  And he's like, what? There's a cult directory. And the field is actually in the cult directory. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7100.0s)]
*  And I didn't even know that. I was like, whoa. So it's been reported. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7105.0s)]
*  So I think a more interesting question actually is why are these cults not shut down? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7110.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a bunch of them like you said. Someone told you there's just tons of them that are active in California. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7114.0s)]
*  And I don't know if it's are that like freedom of speech that we have going on. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7118.0s)]
*  Isn't the real question like how do you define a cult? Yeah. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7122.0s)]
*  Because Scientology has tax exempt status in the United States, which indicates that it's a legitimate religion because they sued the IRS. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7125.0s)]
*  And they won. They smart. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7133.0s)]
*  Thousands of dudes threatened to sue the IRS and they filed lawsuits. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7135.0s)]
*  And I guess the IRS caved and said, all right, we don't want to deal with all this. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7138.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's really powerful of them. It really is. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7142.0s)]
*  But also, if you declare yourself a religion, then you do get tax exempt status. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7145.0s)]
*  But I think what makes a cult is, yeah, I mean, there's like the Steve Hasson thing that we talked about. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7150.0s)]
*  But, you know, this is really, really high control. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7156.0s)]
*  But the question is, unless the abuse is reported in real time, it's really hard to find. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7158.0s)]
*  And the people who are in the cult, A, don't recognize it's a cult because nobody's in a cult calls it a cult. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7163.0s)]
*  And then B, are loyal to the cult. So they're not talking. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7168.0s)]
*  You can't just go in and ask people. They're not going to tell you. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7171.0s)]
*  I would not have told you. I would. There's no way. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7174.0s)]
*  When I was there, when I was 16, I would never have this conversation. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7176.0s)]
*  Right. Not just not publicly. I wouldn't have had a privately either. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7180.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you don't think it's a cult if it's the truth. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7183.0s)]
*  You think it's the truth. You think this isn't a cult. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7186.0s)]
*  We're just the people living the right way. Right. Yeah. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7188.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of people who believe that, I think. Yeah. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7191.0s)]
*  About themselves. They believe that about religions, too. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7193.0s)]
*  I mean, the fact that people want to say that there's like there's certain people that talk historically about the Christian religion and they refer to it as a cult, like just historically. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7196.0s)]
*  Like this is the Christian cult. And this is what they did. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7207.0s)]
*  Like, as you would say, this is the Hindu cult. This is the this cult of that cult. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7210.0s)]
*  They don't think of it as we have this problem like religion, cult, different things. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7216.0s)]
*  But it's groups of people that have very specific rules that you need to live by that's mandated by a higher power. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7221.0s)]
*  Yes. Like if you just break it down to what the ingredients are, like you could tell me it's a steak, but it has all the ingredients of a carrot cake. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7228.0s)]
*  I think this might be a carrot cake. No, no, no. We call it a steak. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7236.0s)]
*  Like, but it seems like it's got carrots. It seems like a carrot cake, you know, and that's religion and cult. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7240.0s)]
*  Like, there's this very blurry line. So Scientology should win that lawsuit. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7246.0s)]
*  So who's to say like what their Mormons aren't legit or they are legit? [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7251.0s)]
*  OK, so they get tax exempt status, but Scientology doesn't. Why? [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7256.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you can come up with a legitimate reason why. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7260.0s)]
*  And in all these groups, Scientology and Mormonism, too, there's these inner circles that are much, much more more devout. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7263.0s)]
*  So there's plenty of people who define themselves as Mormon or Scientologists who aren't living this really narrow life. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7268.0s)]
*  But the people at the center are. But that's the question is like, how hard is it to form a religion? [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7274.0s)]
*  Is it really easy? Like, how easy is it to get that taxes and status? How many people do you like? I can do it. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7279.0s)]
*  I bet you could do it like I could do it. I bet you could do it for sure. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7284.0s)]
*  But it's one of those things. It's like how many you would imagine that everybody would be doing it. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7288.0s)]
*  It's a great way to just trick the government. Sure. You don't have to give them any money. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7294.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think someone did that right, Jamie, like a spaghetti monster or something and actually created the Church of that. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7298.0s)]
*  And you got them. They got tax exempt status for that. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7304.0s)]
*  The flying spaghetti monster. Well, you would be really hard to argue, especially when you deal with something like Scientology, [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7308.0s)]
*  when you have a science fiction writer who is, you know, he's he's the most prolific fiction writer of all time. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7314.0s)]
*  L. Ron Hubbard is he wrote more words down and had them published than any human being that's ever lived. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7324.0s)]
*  I think he was a boy scout, too, actually. Was he? Yeah, we should check that one. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7331.0s)]
*  But I think my favorite is when he's in the sea org and he's got like this military jacket on and just gave himself a bunch of medals. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7334.0s)]
*  He's got like this is tax and medals. Have you gone to the museum? Which one? I think there's more than one, but there's the one in Hollywood. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7340.0s)]
*  No, no, I didn't. I met with them before I got audited. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7346.0s)]
*  Well, you hold on to the cans and they did that. You can feel the energy. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7352.0s)]
*  I was filming a television show in San Diego and we were near a park and this was I was in his famous back then. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7356.0s)]
*  I get away with it. They didn't know how it was. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7362.0s)]
*  And I sat down with this dude. He went through the whole thing with me with the E meter and tell him. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7364.0s)]
*  And I realized someone online that he's just a dude who joined some Scientology. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7368.0s)]
*  And now part of his job is to go out and convert, but he's not very good at it. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7373.0s)]
*  He didn't convert you? No, no. Well, not only that, he's not good at selling it. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7377.0s)]
*  He was very, like very non enthusiastic about it because I would have thought that like all the cult members were like super pumped to get you to join. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7381.0s)]
*  But this guy was just like lost. Like I guess this is my people now. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7387.0s)]
*  And yeah, hold on to the meter. So it was interesting. It's like he wasn't even so like it reshaped in my mind. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7391.0s)]
*  I was like every person trying to indoctrinate you into this cult is going to be like really charismatic and really locked in. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7397.0s)]
*  No, those are the leaders. Right. They get the regular folks to go out to the park and annoy people and get yelled at. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7402.0s)]
*  You fucking wackadoo like. Yeah. So that's the guy that I'm the people at the top don't want to do that. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7408.0s)]
*  It was very weird. I feel like you could be a cult leader, Joe, if you wanted to be. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7413.0s)]
*  I don't think it's that hard. I feel like you could. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7418.0s)]
*  I feel like you could. I don't think it's that hard. If you decided it was one of your life goals, hit me up and I'll give you some like tips and you'll be there in another week or two. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7421.0s)]
*  I'm not interested. If it's a cult, it's a cult. You could leave any time. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7429.0s)]
*  There's no requirements. And just say you're in. When you're in. OK, you're not. I don't care. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7432.0s)]
*  I don't think the apostafarians have tax exempt status. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7437.0s)]
*  But the Scientologists do. If you read the fucking story, anybody that reads that story, the story of the Thetans and the volcano and the aliens and the spirits. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7440.0s)]
*  It's really interesting. It's crazy. It's crazy. If you read the Lawrence Wright's Going Clear, it's a very fascinating book that sort of details the whole history of L. Ron Hubbard creating it. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7450.0s)]
*  And he was basically a crazy person who was self-diagnosing, you know, and so he was like self-counseling and he was using all these self-help books and psychology books trying to figure out how to live life. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7462.0s)]
*  And that was Dianetics. Yeah. You've read some of that, right? Yeah. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7473.0s)]
*  I bought it in the 1990s. They had those infomercials where the volcano and the books were flying out of the volcano. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7478.0s)]
*  I didn't know that it meant like I didn't know the whole story behind the volcano where like the aliens throw the fucking frozen souls of the walk, all that crazy shit. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7485.0s)]
*  So I just thought it was a self-help book. And back then I was really in a self-help book. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7495.0s)]
*  So I bought like Anthony Robbins audio cassettes and all that shit. I was into things like that. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7499.0s)]
*  And so I was like, oh, that seemed like how to maximize your life in this commercial. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7505.0s)]
*  Like, oh, interesting. So I bought it online or on the phone. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7509.0s)]
*  I think I think back then you called wasn't online and they never stopped sending me shit. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7513.0s)]
*  They sent me shit for years, for years. It was invitations to this and invitations to that. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7517.0s)]
*  And, you know, half off of this and free that and come here and meet with us. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7524.0s)]
*  And they just wouldn't stop. They just bombarded me with stuff. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7529.0s)]
*  So you would be a good get if they could get you. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7533.0s)]
*  So you had all these iterations of like these self-help stages of all these things through all of it, right? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7535.0s)]
*  All the ways that you have self-helped in a sense. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7541.0s)]
*  So what has been the most useful to you in being the kind of person you want to be? [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7545.0s)]
*  Time. Time's a big one. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7552.0s)]
*  Learning over time, experiences, introspective thought, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7555.0s)]
*  making decisions based on truth rather than thing than based on what you want to believe. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7561.0s)]
*  And just the accumulation of life experiences like a life well lived and then psychedelic drugs. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7568.0s)]
*  Yeah, those have been very effective. Those are the big ones. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7579.0s)]
*  The psychedelic drug breakthroughs are the ones where you... [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7582.0s)]
*  I always say that it's like control, alt, delete for your brain. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7585.0s)]
*  And then your brain reboots with a fresh desktop. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7589.0s)]
*  But now there's only one folder in that desktop and that folder says, my old bullshit. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7594.0s)]
*  And you have a decision. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7598.0s)]
*  Either you open up that folder and start behaving exactly how you used to [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7600.0s)]
*  because you have a pattern you're accustomed to. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7604.0s)]
*  Or you try to re-engage with the world, re-interface with the world with this newfound experience as a guide. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7606.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7616.0s)]
*  I think that's what the heart of all religious experiences are. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7618.0s)]
*  I think there was people back then that experimented with psychedelic drugs [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7622.0s)]
*  and they had profound experiences and they might have even experienced entities. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7626.0s)]
*  They might have even had interaction with God. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7630.0s)]
*  It might be a real thing that you could do with the right stuff. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7633.0s)]
*  And I think people have been talking about it and writing it on cave walls [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7636.0s)]
*  and depicting it in many religious texts and drawing images of it on the fucking ruins of Egypt. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7640.0s)]
*  I mean, it's everywhere. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7649.0s)]
*  It was in the Illusinian mysteries in Greece. It's everywhere. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7651.0s)]
*  Psychedelic drugs have been everywhere throughout human history. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7654.0s)]
*  I think they probably shaped a lot of the way people formulated their ideas about religion. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7657.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7664.0s)]
*  And I think that a lot of people believe that it was the forging of those mushrooms [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7665.0s)]
*  that led to psychedelic drugs that led the cultivation of communities that were religiously based. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7670.0s)]
*  But that they really came from just looking for food initially. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7676.0s)]
*  And then they would have these experiences and they could see something bigger than the life they were living. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7679.0s)]
*  I always wondered why the Hindus don't eat cows. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7684.0s)]
*  Like how did that become religious? [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7687.0s)]
*  Specifically cows. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7689.0s)]
*  Right. And does it have anything to do with the fact that they make mushrooms? [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7690.0s)]
*  Like, because mushrooms grow on cow shit. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7693.0s)]
*  And if you had cows that were connecting you to God, you wouldn't want to eat them. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7697.0s)]
*  No, they would be a form of a god. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7702.0s)]
*  Yeah, don't eat Betsy. Betsy's cool. She brings us the mushrooms. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7704.0s)]
*  Because that's where the mushrooms grow. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7707.0s)]
*  I mean, is it a coincidence that mushrooms grow on cow shit? [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7709.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7711.0s)]
*  What is the original origin of why Hindus don't eat cows? [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7713.0s)]
*  Because I really don't know. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7717.0s)]
*  But I know that there have been cultures that were cattle worshiping cultures that also had mushroom iconography. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7719.0s)]
*  There's some... [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7726.0s)]
*  I forget the name of the culture. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7728.0s)]
*  It was a weird like Choctaw Hiyuk or something like that. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7732.0s)]
*  But it's a culture that had all their iconography was like cattle and mushrooms. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7736.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7743.0s)]
*  Or some of their iconography, I shouldn't say that. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7745.0s)]
*  Like some of their writings. What's left. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7747.0s)]
*  There's like so many cultures that show evidence that they've been doing stuff with psychedelic drugs forever. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7750.0s)]
*  They probably formulated so many of their, you know, like their shamanistic practices [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7755.0s)]
*  and how they organize their culture and their communities. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7763.0s)]
*  They would probably all do rituals together to connect to each other. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7767.0s)]
*  You know, and stare at the stars. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7770.0s)]
*  But they think about psychedelics though that is so beautiful compared to cults. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7772.0s)]
*  And cults don't do these because they tap you into yourself and you have your own unique or somewhat unique, [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7775.0s)]
*  but you know, you have your own individual experience of what it means to you. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7781.0s)]
*  And cults can't allow you to have that. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7784.0s)]
*  That's true. But you know, there are a lot of instances of guys who are shaman, even in the rainforest, that do creepy shit. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7786.0s)]
*  Oh, well, they're human. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7794.0s)]
*  They're not just human. It's like they do start running things like a cult, even though they're shamans and they're giving people ayahuasca. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7796.0s)]
*  That's depressing. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7804.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, certain of them, some of them might have gravitated towards that with that intention in mind. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7806.0s)]
*  Right. Like they might not have been born true of the shamanistic spirit. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7814.0s)]
*  They might have entered into it at a point in life, like as a con artist, you know, which does happen. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7818.0s)]
*  It does happen. Like people infiltrate certain kind of groups of people if they feel like it's a bunch of vulnerable people in those groups [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7825.0s)]
*  and a bunch of like easily influenced and, you know, open to interpretation. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7832.0s)]
*  And, you know, you could just tell them that you're connected to God in a very unique way. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7837.0s)]
*  And also you're a guru, you know? Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of those guys, too. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7841.0s)]
*  I mean, that was the wild, wild country guy. You know, he was like a legit guru. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7846.0s)]
*  Said some Osho, said some brilliant things, but also was fucking crazy out of his mind. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7852.0s)]
*  I feel like we need to be skeptical of anyone who tells us that they know the word of God, that they are connected to God and you're not. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7858.0s)]
*  So if you tell me this is my experience and I ask you questions, I can choose to follow you or not follow you, right? [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7866.0s)]
*  Based on whether or not I like the results of your experience, et cetera. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7872.0s)]
*  But somebody who says, no, God told me this and this is the only way. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7875.0s)]
*  But imagine if God really did tell you and nobody wanted to believe you. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7880.0s)]
*  Well, I'm sure a lot of people really am a prophet. Yeah. Well, that was my grandpa. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7883.0s)]
*  Guys, I know this is crazy. I know this sounds crazy, but I just got back from the mountain that God gave me a series of rules. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7888.0s)]
*  I got to give it to you. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7894.0s)]
*  Nobody would believe you, which is really ironic about today. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7896.0s)]
*  Like Christians really want Jesus to return. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7900.0s)]
*  But like what amount of convincing would you have to do to get people to believe you were really Jesus? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7904.0s)]
*  You'd have to do so much work. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7909.0s)]
*  And how many people would be convinced that it's Satan pretending to be Jesus? [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7911.0s)]
*  So then they'd be that battle. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7914.0s)]
*  The same people that think Michelle Obama is a dick. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7916.0s)]
*  There's going to be people that think they're going to think the nuttiest of things. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7918.0s)]
*  And then Jesus is going to be like, guys, guys, guys, I am not Satan. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7922.0s)]
*  I'm actually Jesus. Nobody believe him. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7927.0s)]
*  We would fucking crucify him again. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7930.0s)]
*  And then people realize, God damn it, we did it again. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7932.0s)]
*  We did it again. We could have kept him around and learned from him. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7934.0s)]
*  And now they're going to have to rewrite Christianity. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7937.0s)]
*  Every few thousand years, he comes back and they fucking kill him again. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7940.0s)]
*  Cycle of life. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7944.0s)]
*  Well, that would be that's the really scary thing to think that if if the Son of God really did return, if that is a real true thing, how the fuck would we ever believe that? [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7946.0s)]
*  We don't believe anything anymore. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7958.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the tradition, right, is this trumpet is going to sound and you think the trumpet in the sky. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7960.0s)]
*  But we would be convinced as the government. That's air horns. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7966.0s)]
*  They're tricking us. This is the ultimate false flag. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7969.0s)]
*  The Jesus returns false flag. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7972.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what a lot of people think is going on with the UFO reports. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7974.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7977.0s)]
*  They think it's bullshit. They think it's the government and the government's lying to us about that. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7979.0s)]
*  They're from another planet, you know, which is, you know, they lie about everything. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7983.0s)]
*  Like if they're telling you something, this year, these are off world crafts. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7989.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, when did we make these like shut the fuck up? [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7992.0s)]
*  When do we make these? You're saying they're out from another planet for real. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7995.0s)]
*  I don't believe you. I mean, it could be a case of crying wolf. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=7999.0s)]
*  Like maybe they're telling the truth, but boy seems a little suspicious. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8002.0s)]
*  And that would be the same thing with the Jesus thing. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8005.0s)]
*  Like if Jesus really did come back and there was some fundamental Christian is fundamentalist Christians that were in government that wanted the world to know. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8007.0s)]
*  So they had a press conference and we have definitive proof that Jesus has returned and we need to listen to him. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8015.0s)]
*  Everybody like, get the fuck out of here. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8020.0s)]
*  No one would believe it. That's what's crazy about today. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8022.0s)]
*  If Jesus came back today and the world was in the middle of chaos, if we're in the middle of World War Three and Jesus returns, it's a real likelihood that they would crucify him again or something similar. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8026.0s)]
*  Real likelihood. He falls in the wrong group of people. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8037.0s)]
*  The modern day version of the Romans. Right. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8040.0s)]
*  You could fall in the wrong group of people. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8043.0s)]
*  And like if Jesus like accidentally landed in ISIS country, could you imagine? [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8045.0s)]
*  I don't know if it would be an accident, but OK. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8052.0s)]
*  Right. Probably not an accident. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8055.0s)]
*  But maybe, you know, Jesus is just like, let me just go down there. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8057.0s)]
*  And it wasn't specific enough. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8060.0s)]
*  And God didn't say, like, where do you want to go? Like, send me to Manhattan. No. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8062.0s)]
*  He said, just bring me to Earth. And he just dropped him off right in ISIS camp. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8067.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That'd be very dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8071.0s)]
*  And then the whole thing starts all over again. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8073.0s)]
*  And then we have to tell the story about the guy who came from God. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8075.0s)]
*  He was God's son. And ISIS killed him. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8078.0s)]
*  I don't think we've changed that much since the Pharisees and Sadducees and all that. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8080.0s)]
*  I mean, we've changed a little, but I think so much of our change is not a human nature change. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8084.0s)]
*  Right. That's what's going to sell. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8090.0s)]
*  So much of our change is technological. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8091.0s)]
*  So much of our change is society and wooden buildings and concrete structures and roads and metal forks, bones and metal forks. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8093.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's changed. But the actual tissue is real similar. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8101.0s)]
*  It's real similar to people that lived 10,000 years ago. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8106.0s)]
*  So if we've got the human nature like more suppressed now than it's ever been before. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8109.0s)]
*  But like we were talking about earlier, if you're in a crowd situation and things go chaos, then you go, oh, we're still this thing. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8117.0s)]
*  We're still a program for war. We're still programmed for chaos. It's all in us. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8123.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And mob mentality, all of that. It's all in us. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8128.0s)]
*  People change. They absolutely change when they're in a group. Group dynamics are always different. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8132.0s)]
*  I think you see it online, too. I think mob mentality exists not even just in a physical space, but I think it exists in a digital space, too. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8136.0s)]
*  I think when people gang up on people online, on Twitter and those kind of things, I think that's the same thing. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8145.0s)]
*  I think it's the same kind of mob mentality. It's the same sort of energy that is in us. It's very creepy. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8150.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's very creepy. And it's one of those things where you're like, how do we ever get that out? [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8157.0s)]
*  How do we ever get these ancient primate inclinations out of the modern human organism? [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8163.0s)]
*  I think if we had an answer for that, that we would be very, very, very wealthy. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8171.0s)]
*  Maybe or the government will kill you. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8177.0s)]
*  Yeah. It would be hard to control people if you had the answer to that. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8181.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think for individuals, the most important thing is exercise. It's one of the most important things, I should say, because you can induce enough stress voluntarily [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8185.0s)]
*  that the regular stress of the outside world is mitigated because you've already experienced a higher level of difficulty in your day by choice than the world can impose upon you. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8196.0s)]
*  So if you have rigorous workout schedules, if you like to run, if you want to lift weights, if you want to do yoga, if you want to do something with jujitsu, do something that's physically taxing, that's what you should do. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8206.0s)]
*  Do something like that. And this the physical act of forcing yourself to do something extremely difficult that makes you uncomfortable for a short period of time, but makes the rest of the day much easier. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8216.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it is. You got to just feed the monkey inside of you. You got to like don't deny its existence. Just do something to that thing to calm it down. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8227.0s)]
*  Give it food. You know? [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8237.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder statistically, those of us who exercise, if we are less inclined to get online and terrorize other people in mob mentality, I would guess that may be true. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8239.0s)]
*  I would bet that's true. A lot of the people that I know that terrorize people in mob mentality, they're extremely unhealthy. They look terrible. They get addicted to it. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8248.0s)]
*  They get addicted to interacting online on Twitter all the time and like gauging the temperature socially of how people think about them based on this verbose bullshit they just typed on Facebook. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8257.0s)]
*  But it's like it becomes this integral part of the way they engage with other human beings. And it's very non-human. It's very recent. It's very non-human. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8270.0s)]
*  It's too limited in the way you interact with it. It's just like you can get good information online and you can get interesting discussions on Twitter, but you could also get like you're dealing with like legitimately mentally ill people. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8280.0s)]
*  And I don't use that term lightly. Okay, I'm not saying schizophrenic. I'm not saying manic depressive. But if you are a person that has a gambling addict addiction, if you're a person that has an addiction to betting on the horses, you're mentally ill. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8295.0s)]
*  You have this thing you're sick with. If you can't stop smoking cigarettes, you're mentally ill. You have this thing that you can't stop. You're physically attracted to it. You're physically addicted to it. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8311.0s)]
*  But you're also mentally ill because you don't recognize that you should stop before you get fucking lung cancer. Right? That's the same thing with everything, I think. I think these are just like normal patterns. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8320.0s)]
*  And I think people that are addicted to arguing with people on Twitter, they're mentally ill. This is serving the same thing as online poker. This is serving the same thing as fill in the blanks. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8332.0s)]
*  Whatever you like to do that you probably shouldn't be doing, scratch tickets, lottery, whatever it is that you just can't get out of your head because you got locked into it. You're mentally ill. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8343.0s)]
*  You're mentally ill. Just like when you have a cough, you're physically ill. Yeah, when you're online 12 hours a day arguing with people, you're mentally ill. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8352.0s)]
*  And maybe you're mentally ill and having good discussions. Maybe you're mentally ill and engaging in sometimes productive conversations. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8360.0s)]
*  But you're also, you're heightening your levels of anxiety and this bizarre, non-natural way of interfacing with other human beings. And you're living in that most of the time. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8369.0s)]
*  So you're going to suffer in the way you interact with people on a regular basis. And you see that bleed out too, right? You see people act like they're on Twitter into people in real life. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8380.0s)]
*  And you're like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Why are you acting like this? Because they're so used to communicating like that on Twitter and on Facebook and Instagram that they think it's normal to just be completely rude to people. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8391.0s)]
*  Yeah. You can't do that in the wilderness. Right. There's not enough cell reception to do that in the wilderness. Right. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8401.0s)]
*  And you can't do that face to face because it feels weird. If you do that face, if you if you talk to people face to face the way people talk to people just constantly on Twitter, you would have fistfights everywhere. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8408.0s)]
*  People would be just fighting. They'd be pushing each other and hitting each other. You'd have murders. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8419.0s)]
*  Like it's just it's just a shitty way to talk. So if you're doing that, you're mentally ill. So if you have gangs of mentally ill people that are just constantly engaging with other gangs of mentally ill people online all day long, arguing over everything cultural, everything environmental, fill in the blanks, climate change, fill in the blank, Ukraine, whatever it is, Palestine, free Palestine. Fuck you. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8424.0s)]
*  It's all day long. Mentally ill people. Yeah. And I think China's laughing at us. Oh, they said that they yes. I mean, I don't know if they said it all out, but they have infiltrated it. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8451.0s)]
*  They have done a wonderful job. I say China. I say, yeah, way to go. That tick tock. Very effective. Fucking genius. Yeah. What you've done is genius. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8466.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they've definitely infiltrated universities. They definitely they grants and funds. They put money into things. They donate to things. It's what they've done is wild. It's wild. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8477.0s)]
*  And I would say that the same, I guess, impulses that make people do what everything you're describing are really the same things that keep people in cults. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8489.0s)]
*  Like there was a lot of the similar traits of people who become mentally ill because they are constantly only focusing on one person's definition of anything. Yes. Yes. So if cults were online, doing that to each other, that's what they would sound like. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8498.0s)]
*  Most certainly. Mark Andreessen again talked about that as well. He said they have if you look like the woke people online, they have all the characteristics of a cult. They have excommunications. They'll savagely attack former members. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8515.0s)]
*  They have rules and there's there's things that you there's a suspension of disbelief that you have to use in order to adopt certain things. You have to you have to be willing to say things you know aren't really true. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8527.0s)]
*  And they all get you to do it. You know, well, because it's part of the in group. Yeah, like that's how you get status. Yeah. But it's just fascinating to see how far that stuff goes up. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8541.0s)]
*  You know, like even with like people that run universities like they believe it. People that are in Congress, they believe it. It's like Jesus. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8553.0s)]
*  Like this is we're all in a cult. Cult thinking is not like I think people have this thing in their head that cults are like small groups of people that are gullible. No. And I don't think that's true. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8561.0s)]
*  I think I think you could have a cult of one hundred and fifty million people. Easy. Easy. If you have someone controlling your behavior, information, your thoughts and your emotions, then yeah. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8574.0s)]
*  And if you have a good system set up where everybody polices everybody else, like woke people on Twitter, and then you have a good system of like the person who's in charge and the underlings and all the other people. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8585.0s)]
*  And it's like and people are benefited from it in a good way. Yeah. You can get a bunch of businesses going. You can infiltrate corporations with this nonsense. You can you can get in the Supreme Court. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8596.0s)]
*  It's you could do wild things with it. You just you just need to have like a strong structure of support from the other members online. Yeah. You just get people to police each other and place themselves. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8608.0s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yeah. That's the big one. Right. That's the North Korean model. Please get people to police themselves. Yeah. Get people to rat on each other. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8618.0s)]
*  Who? Yeah, I think I just came full circle on that. Yeah, I think your story is very important for people to hear. And I'm really I'm really happy that you had the courage to say it because I would imagine it would be very, very hard to tell that story. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8628.0s)]
*  Very hard to explain the vulnerabilities that you experienced and what it was like to be this 17 year old kid is still a kid who's like, you know, just coming a woman out there in the world and you just escaped from a cult where you couldn't even see movies. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8643.0s)]
*  And all you sung was hymns and you thought the end was near. And then you're out there in the world just interacting with all these people that went to like normal schools and had normal childhood American experiences. And you have to kind of relearn everything. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8658.0s)]
*  Yeah. And there's a lot of excommunication that still goes on in terms of it's my family of origin. It's all every single cousin I had was raised there. I did not have any cousins on the other side. 100 percent of my relatives were raised in there. And so, yeah, you have to be willing to, in a sense, step away from the acceptance that you get, which I think had to relate to many, many, many, many people who have nothing to do with religion. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8672.0s)]
*  But yeah, all the different types of cults in the world is like being willing to stand back and say, wait, I don't believe this. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8696.0s)]
*  I think this story, your story is really important, too, for people that may be vulnerable. You know, maybe they don't have the tools to discern. Like maybe they're being courted by a group. You know, they don't have the tools to discern. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8702.0s)]
*  Like, why? And just fundamentally, if someone's telling you that they have secret information that only they have and it comes from a mystical source, either comes from aliens or comes from God or probably not. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8715.0s)]
*  Probably not. It's probably not. It's probably not. I mean, it might be Jesus. Again, if Jesus came back, who's going to believe him? But most likely you're dealing with someone who's full of shit. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8729.0s)]
*  So at least today, we know that. You know, in 1930, when your grandpa first started, I mean, he was just running wild. Like there's no Wikipedia. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8741.0s)]
*  You can say anything. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8753.0s)]
*  You can just go, oh, or Joseph Smith, who created the Book of Mormon, you know, like that fucking guy. He was like 14 years old. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8754.0s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8763.0s)]
*  Teddy found golden tablets that contained the lost work of Jesus, but only he could read it because he had a magic rock. And everybody's like, okay. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8765.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the kind of thing my grandfather said, too. And people believed it. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8773.0s)]
*  There was a lot of those guys back then. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8777.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could wave a lot back then. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8779.0s)]
*  What do you think is the motivation? Like, what is it about human beings and almost always men? [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8780.0s)]
*  There's only a few women that have been successful cult leaders. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8787.0s)]
*  Yes, it's pretty rare. Yeah. That one that was on the HBO documentary. I haven't seen it yet, but everybody raves about it. You know what I'm talking about? [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8791.0s)]
*  I do, but I haven't seen it. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8798.0s)]
*  The lady who became anorexic. What is it? Love? What was that one, Jamie? What's it called? [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8800.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be amazing, but I haven't seen it. But what is it that that seems to be a recurring pattern? [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8803.0s)]
*  So I've always found it really fascinating to say that anyone could be a cult member. Anyone could fall for that, especially if you're young. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8814.0s)]
*  But it's who would become a cult leader? Like, that's the bigger question. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8822.0s)]
*  Jim Jones. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8826.0s)]
*  I feel like there's no simple answer for that, but in my grandfather's case and in many other of these young men cases, they were outsiders in some way and they had some bone to pick. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8827.0s)]
*  I think they maybe started out of wanting belonging, but then they got really drunk on the power so quickly. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8837.0s)]
*  Like Manson. Yeah. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8844.0s)]
*  So I've been teaching in prisons, by the way, it's been part of my career, and I worked with Leslie Van Houten. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8846.0s)]
*  She's been released now, but she was the tutor in the program I was working in. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8853.0s)]
*  She was like 19 when she participated in, but she followed Manson as if he was a cult leader. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8858.0s)]
*  It's very similar. And I'm not talking about the politics of all that. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8866.0s)]
*  I'm just saying that I'm very grateful that nobody asked me to kill anybody. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8870.0s)]
*  I would like to think I wouldn't, but I don't think any of us know. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8875.0s)]
*  Right. If you were 12 years old and your whole life you'd lived in that cult and you were told to kill some man because he's a demon. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8878.0s)]
*  Right. And if you killed them and they were like hugging you, you did it, you saved us from the demon, you'd be pumped. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8883.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think you would be. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8891.0s)]
*  Of course, children like that, especially if you get them. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8893.0s)]
*  They're trained in armies at that age. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8896.0s)]
*  Exactly. And that's also why people like people joining the army when they're young, not just because they're strong, but also because they're mentally unaware of the conflicts of the world. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8897.0s)]
*  It's really difficult to get a 60-year-old man to go to war based on, you know, we found weapons of mass destruction. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8908.0s)]
*  Okay, they'll put on his reading glasses. Let me see this shit. What do you got? [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8914.0s)]
*  Show me what the fuck you got. I'm going to fly to Afghanistan. Show me what you have. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8919.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8923.0s)]
*  You need him. Yes, sir. We're going to go kill the bad guy, sir. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8924.0s)]
*  That's what you need. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8928.0s)]
*  But the cult leaders have something that they really feel like they need, like they need people's respect because I don't think they could get it in other ways. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8930.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8938.0s)]
*  And so they create this whole world. And honestly, once people start believing you, it's probably a pretty big high. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8940.0s)]
*  Yeah. I had David Holthaus on the podcast the other day and he did that documentary series that's on Peacock about the Hare Krishnas. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8944.0s)]
*  Oh. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8952.0s)]
*  About this one guy that created this sect of the Hare Krishnas and it was all child molestation and murder. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8953.0s)]
*  They're killing people and it's just, it's a crazy, it's a really good doc. He's a really good director. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8959.0s)]
*  And the documentary series is really interesting, but it's just like, God damn, that pattern just repeats itself over and over. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8965.0s)]
*  Waco, holy hell, up there, wild, wild country. It's like everywhere. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8973.0s)]
*  The same sort of pattern repeats itself and it always, almost always at least, falls apart. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8977.0s)]
*  It's hard to keep that stuff going because. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8984.0s)]
*  But you're a crazy person. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8987.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you have to keep upping the ante. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8989.0s)]
*  Right. It's not like Warren Buffett. He's not out there starting cults. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8991.0s)]
*  It's not like people are good at organizing businesses. It's like crazy people, like wild, crazy people. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8993.0s)]
*  But there's this inclination to get people to follow you and to tell them what to do and to tell them how to live life and to make them worship you. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=8998.0s)]
*  It's fucking strange that that's just some sort of weird evolutionary response. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9008.0s)]
*  Like because in tribal cultures there was always a leader and that leader was generally the wisest person who had the most life experience who could tell you, hey, this is the plant you can't eat. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9015.0s)]
*  Don't go over there. They'll kill you. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9025.0s)]
*  This thing runs fast in you. Get away from it. That snake's poisonous. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9027.0s)]
*  You had to know how to make an arrow. This guy knew. So that was your leader. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9032.0s)]
*  And if you listen to him, you're going to stay alive. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9037.0s)]
*  And if you don't listen to him, you're going to watch people die right next to you and you go, oh, they didn't listen. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9039.0s)]
*  And you're going to experience that at a young age where people die because they used to die all the fucking time. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9044.0s)]
*  Of course. Yeah. Just infant mortality was like 50% back then. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9049.0s)]
*  And then you're like, what are the odds you're going to live to 30? [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9052.0s)]
*  That's not so good, bro. This Jaguars in the fucking trees. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9055.0s)]
*  Like you're fucked. You're in trouble. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9059.0s)]
*  And that's why we had tribal leaders. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9061.0s)]
*  And then as we expanded into these societies and cities and large groups of human beings, we still had the desire to have one individual leader because we have this primate genetic imprint in us of the alpha who runs the people. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9064.0s)]
*  To the point where we'll pretend that someone's alpha. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9080.0s)]
*  Like we'll pretend Joe Biden is really running the country. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9082.0s)]
*  We'll pretend. And so many Democrats are all in on it. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9084.0s)]
*  Like the most culty of cult members, the wokest of woke are the ones who are the most likely to try to fucking gaslight you that he's fine and he's doing great. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9087.0s)]
*  And he's the best president ever. And just look at the economics and look at the economy is doing better. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9097.0s)]
*  And look at the, you know, he's on top. He's never been sharper. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9101.0s)]
*  Like, what do you shut up? You're in a cult. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9104.0s)]
*  You're in a cult. Just like if you were in the Moonies, just like you've you're in the holy hell cult. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9106.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. It's just patterns of belief. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9110.0s)]
*  And we all have them and we're susceptible to them because life is a massive mystery. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9114.0s)]
*  It's a massive, scary, weird mystery with a lifespan. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9119.0s)]
*  It's got a finite lifespan. You have a certain amount of time here and you never think like you have enough time. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9123.0s)]
*  You never think you did enough. And it always feels weird. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9128.0s)]
*  And you never even know what the fuck is going on while you're driving your car or sitting on the bus the whole time. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9131.0s)]
*  You're like, what is this? What is this all about? [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9136.0s)]
*  So anytime you can get some relief from that, someone comes along and they go, I've got the answers. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9138.0s)]
*  Right. Come with me, Michelle. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9144.0s)]
*  Okay, so that's not happening anymore. No, of course not. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9146.0s)]
*  But you know, when you said that to us thinking like it is, it's the belief that there's answers instead of what I think you and I believe is that it's always more questions. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9150.0s)]
*  Like we don't have the answers and we will there will be continuing. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9158.0s)]
*  There'll be questions that we never answer in our lifetime. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9163.0s)]
*  Well, also we exist in a certain frequency in reality, but there's subatomic reality that's so damn confusing that somehow or another a part of us that we can study. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9164.0s)]
*  Like what's all that magic? What's all that magic going on? [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9182.0s)]
*  What's all that magic going on where you got particles that are both moving and still they exist and reappear, they disappear. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9185.0s)]
*  We don't know where the fuck they're going. What's happening there? [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9193.0s)]
*  What is that stuff? What's all that stuff? [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9196.0s)]
*  There's so much that we don't know. There's so there's so much weirdness just in the observable universe that it's the whole thing is a crazy mystery. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9200.0s)]
*  And to not approach it that way and to approach it with some bizarre confidence that you have the answers. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9210.0s)]
*  You're not doing anybody any good because you're full of shit. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9216.0s)]
*  You're full of shit with yourself. You're full of shit. If you believe it, you're full of shit with yourself. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9219.0s)]
*  You're definitely full of shit with other people. If you're telling them you believe it, you can't know. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9223.0s)]
*  We have guidelines and there's ways that we can live that are going to be better for everybody. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9228.0s)]
*  And we should definitely go that way. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9232.0s)]
*  Definitely don't try to harm people. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9234.0s)]
*  Definitely try to be nice as much as possible. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9236.0s)]
*  Try to be cool to your friends. Try to enjoy your time here. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9237.0s)]
*  Try to leave people with a smile. Try to do your best. Do that stuff. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9241.0s)]
*  Like if we do all that stuff, we're good. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9246.0s)]
*  But as soon as someone comes along and tells you, no, you have to do this because this is the word of God. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9248.0s)]
*  Like be suspicious because it's been around before. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9254.0s)]
*  It's it's not like this is a unique thing. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9259.0s)]
*  I feel like be suspicious is some good advice. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9262.0s)]
*  Be suspicious. Yeah. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9265.0s)]
*  Be suspicious of anybody that's trying to get you to do things. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9267.0s)]
*  Like they're trying to tell you to do a thing and that if you don't do a thing, you're a bad person. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9271.0s)]
*  And the people that are engaging in other things other than what they're telling you are all going to hell. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9277.0s)]
*  Like, okay, let me put my reading glass on. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9283.0s)]
*  Let me see this hell. You got a fucking YouTube video I can watch. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9286.0s)]
*  Like how much do you know? Are you sure? [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9290.0s)]
*  Do you have the GPS coordinates of that? [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9294.0s)]
*  Do you have the onyx maps of hell? [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9295.0s)]
*  I don't think you know what you're talking about. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9299.0s)]
*  And if you don't say that, if you don't have the humility to say that this is at the very least a massive mystery, we know so much. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9301.0s)]
*  I mean, we know so much more than we've ever known before. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9309.0s)]
*  And thank God there's people out there that are trying to figure the world out. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9311.0s)]
*  Thank God there's people out there that are doing the work and doing the fucking theoretical physicists and all the quantum mechanics people and all the people that are like trying to make rocket ships. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9314.0s)]
*  Thank God you're out there. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9325.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, this is a crazy mystery that you go to bed every night, you close your eyes and you disappear. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9327.0s)]
*  Hopefully for eight hours if you get in your eight hours, Michelle. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9336.0s)]
*  And then that alarm clock goes off and then you reengage with reality and assume that this is the exact same world that you went to bed eight hours ago for. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9339.0s)]
*  You assume. But you just reengage with reality. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9349.0s)]
*  We look forward to it. Everyone's scared to die, but no one's scared to sleep. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9352.0s)]
*  And we do it every night. No one's scared. I don't want to shut the lights out. I don't want to go to sleep. No one's scared to go to sleep. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9359.0s)]
*  Everybody's like, oh my God, I can't wait to sleep. Can't wait to sleep and be recovered. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9366.0s)]
*  And then you get up. You have to do it. It's a requirement. You have to go out. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9370.0s)]
*  You have to stop. If you don't, you'll die. The universe requires you to stop interfacing with it for long stretches of time. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9374.0s)]
*  Ideally eight hours. So I hear. Yeah. Full 30 a day. Yeah. It's a wild thing. Yeah. Full 30 a day. You reboot. Yeah. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9383.0s)]
*  We process in our dreams in ways that we don't understand. It's very strange. Yeah. It's very strange. Just that alone is very strange. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9393.0s)]
*  There's many, many strange things. Yeah. But that alone is a strange, strange one that we've just accepted because if that didn't exist and all of a sudden everybody said, listen, we have found a new thing. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9399.0s)]
*  Instead of just being awake all the time, if you can just go to sleep, you'll live longer and you'll be better. Like, what are you talking about? [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9410.0s)]
*  Like, you're just going to shut off for eight hours. And then what happens to me? Like, can I see? No. What if someone breaks into my house? Well, you're asleep. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9418.0s)]
*  Fuck that. No one would want to do that. Yeah. But it's normal. So we just do it. Yeah. Yeah. It's a mystery. This is a crazy ass mystery. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9425.0s)]
*  And what happens in your dreams? Like, why are those damn things so realistic? What the fuck? It depends on the night. What the fuck is going on in dreams? [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9436.0s)]
*  One thing happens if you smoke pot. Your dreams kind of dull a little bit sometimes. But if you take long breaks off, like we do sober October and during sober October, we don't do anything. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9445.0s)]
*  And when you take long breaks off, you get wild dreams. Wild. And here's a little pro tip. If you want to have the wildest dreams, take nootropics before you go to bed. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9456.0s)]
*  Take like alpha brain before you go to bed. Because you want to have these dreams? Yeah. Let's go. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9468.0s)]
*  Okay. I mean, when I was a little kid, I used to love nightmares. When I was a little kid, I would look forward to a nightmare. I would try to make me have one. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9474.0s)]
*  Wow. Because I like horror movies. So I was like, let's have a, let's get some monsters in here. I would literally go to bed. I was like, God, I hope I get the fuck scared out of me. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9483.0s)]
*  I looked forward to like having a nightmare dream. Wow. I had a bunch of crazy ones too that I remember. I even wrote a bunch of them down because they were so nuts. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9493.0s)]
*  Like plot of movies. They were so crazy. But it just was a thing where I, I thought of it as like an adventure ride. I would thought of like nightmares as an adventure ride. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9499.0s)]
*  Like I knew I kept waking up. So, okay. All right. After I was like four or five, I'm like, yeah, I'm waking up. So I know they're not real, but it is pretty fun if they're scary. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9512.0s)]
*  If I can just relax. So I was thinking that I remember thinking that as a little kid thinking like, I think there's a way to just make yourself have nightmares and just do it for fun. Just like watching a scary movie. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9521.0s)]
*  Wow. Is any of that lucid dreaming? [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9532.0s)]
*  I've only done lucid dreaming accidentally a couple of times. And every time I've done it, I've recognized that I'm dreaming and then I wake up because I recognize it. That's the problem. I don't know how to chill. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9534.0s)]
*  Do you remember most of your dreams? [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9548.0s)]
*  I remember a lot of them though. I don't remember most of them. I would say I remember a small fraction of them, but I remember them for a long time. Yeah. What about you? [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9550.0s)]
*  I do. I remember a lot of dreams. I mean, I could never, nobody would know if you remember all of them for one. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9566.0s)]
*  Right. How would you know? [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9571.0s)]
*  But yeah, I still dream about the field. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9573.0s)]
*  Really? That makes sense. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9575.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Because it's in your subconscious and you're just like, I'm still processing. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9576.0s)]
*  I didn't have a bad time in high school. It wasn't the worst. I had a pretty good time in high school, but I would have nightmares that I had to go back to high school. Like legitimate nightmares that like I didn't get enough credits so I didn't graduate so I had to go back. Nightmares. And high school was not that bad. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9580.0s)]
*  Now, I can't imagine how much that would be multiplied leaving a cult. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9594.0s)]
*  They're very formative years. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9601.0s)]
*  Yeah. So like even for you. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9603.0s)]
*  All of them. Yeah. They're very formative and your prefrontal cortex is not, you know, completely formed. And so we probably all go back to whatever degree to that part of us. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9605.0s)]
*  But those nightmares must be very vivid for you though and must be very extreme because like I said, I would get nightmares from high school, which was nothing. It was no big deal. It wasn't bad at all. I didn't have a bad time in high school, you know, but it was just the idea of being trapped in that fucking school another year was scary. And that's nothing. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9613.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the being trapped. I have a lot of dreams like that. Yeah. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9631.0s)]
*  Do they subside with time? [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9637.0s)]
*  They've gotten better. You know, I saw just two days ago I met this guy who I hadn't seen since I was a kid. So for me, I kind of met him for the first time, you know, in the sense of I don't remember him. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9639.0s)]
*  But he said that reading Forager and he really said this and I, it was, he said he had nightmares. He's always had nightmares. This man is late 60s, probably maybe even 70. I don't know. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9650.0s)]
*  And he said that reading it stopped his nightmares because he thinks because somebody validated so he didn't feel like it was trapped in his head anymore. Someone validated and named his experience because he wasn't talking about it. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9659.0s)]
*  Not even to his own family like his whole life. He's never talked about it. And so having just seeing in a book made him say like, I'm not crazy, you know. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9671.0s)]
*  And so I just wonder sometimes if our nightmares are also things. I mean, it's great that you were like causing ones on purpose, but the kinds that are like really deeply disturb us. I just wonder if they're parts of us that we haven't fully come to terms with. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9678.0s)]
*  I wonder, but some of mine is like Godzilla chasing me when I'm on a skateboard. They don't make any sense. I think I think there's certainly like, I mean, I don't try to have nightmares now. I really only did that a few times when I was a kid. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9692.0s)]
*  But the nightmares that I do have that almost all of them are like really primal ones. Like I've had a lot of nightmares about wolves like a lot over the years, like running from wolves. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9705.0s)]
*  There's something about wolves because they're intelligent and they operate in packs and they have some sort of nonverbal communication where they understand each other and some very weird way. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9718.0s)]
*  They're similar to us in a lot of ways. Yeah. Yeah. They, they freak me out. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9729.0s)]
*  They really do. You know, they're not that different from dogs. Yeah, they're a lot different from dogs. They're a lot different from dogs. Well, they are because they're wild, but I have a golden retriever. Okay. They're way different than a golden retriever. Way different. I have a strange shepherd's and they're not that different. My dog is a love sponge. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9735.0s)]
*  He loves everybody. If he came in here, he would be... But you're part of his pack. Oh, yeah, no doubt, but he's not a wolf. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9751.0s)]
*  Okay. There's a big difference. I mean, he used to be a wolf. If you go back 20,000 years ago or whatever it was when they started taking these bitch ass wolves or willing to come by the forest fire or by the campfire rather. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9759.0s)]
*  But the, the wolves that live and operate in the wild are these ruthless, majestic creatures who are intelligent. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9770.0s)]
*  Right. But the reason that you love your dog is the same reason that wolves love each other. You know, I mean, there is this because they're part of a pack and because they understand relationships. And I think the wolves with each other, you're just not in relationship with the wolf. But I mean, of course they're scary. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9779.0s)]
*  But yeah, but they're because they're so good at what they do. Right. But that's why we're scared of deer. Well, yeah, yeah. We are in the woods with a rifle. Deer should be fucking scared. Yeah. And that's, that's why they jump on the toilet running away real quick. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9795.0s)]
*  And that's the thing with wolves and human beings. Like we've been food for them for a long time. That's what Little Red Riding Hood is all about. That's really that's what the Big Bad Wolf is all about. That's the whole story. The story is about wolves that will eat your kids because that's what they did. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9809.0s)]
*  Yeah, they eat people. World War One had to be they had a ceasefire between the Germans and the Russians because too many of them were getting eaten by wolves. That's why they had a ceasefire. Yeah, they had a ceasefire and they killed the wolves and they went back to killing each other. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9828.0s)]
*  They couldn't have just taken a break and said like, oh, well, maybe we should be on the same side. No, they were losing so many people to wolves that they had these packs of wolves in Russia. And this was trench warfare. So they are the horrific wounds. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9843.0s)]
*  These people would be lying in the trenches with a bullet hole and then you'd hear wolves tearing these people apart and they'd be screaming. Yeah, they would send people out on patrol and just find a boot with a foot in it. Oh, my God. Yeah. You should be scared of wolves. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9857.0s)]
*  You should be scared of wolves. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9871.0s)]
*  You should be scared of wolves. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9872.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they're reintroducing wolves now to Colorado. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9873.0s)]
*  They just did and they just had the first wolf depredation where wolf killed a calf [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9876.28s)]
*  at a ranch. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9882.2s)]
*  And that's just the beginning. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9883.76s)]
*  There's a reason why they killed those things. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9884.76s)]
*  I don't think they should have. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9886.6s)]
*  I don't think they should have made wolves extinct in the western United States like [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9887.6s)]
*  they did. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9893.1s)]
*  I think it was horrible. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9894.1s)]
*  They put strychnine in horses and they left them out there and the wolves would eat it [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9895.1s)]
*  and die. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9897.72s)]
*  They did horrible, terrible things. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9898.72s)]
*  You don't want wolves. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9901.06s)]
*  You don't want them around. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9902.5s)]
*  You don't want a lot of them, especially with these bitch ass people today. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9903.5s)]
*  You're going to fucking lose a lot of folks if those things get to high numbers. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9906.46s)]
*  You're going to lose a lot of folks. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9911.26s)]
*  A lot of people are going to be camping and they're going to get surrounded. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9913.66s)]
*  Just needs certain numbers. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9917.539999999999s)]
*  It needs numbers where they think they can get away with stuff like that. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9918.539999999999s)]
*  Numbers where there's not enough people with guns. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9922.46s)]
*  They find out that they think people are just hikers. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9924.3s)]
*  They don't seem to have any weapons. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9926.78s)]
*  They know where the weapon is. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9928.699999999999s)]
*  They figure that out. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9930.02s)]
*  Over time, wolves see enough rifles. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9931.54s)]
*  They know what a rifle is. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9933.060000000001s)]
*  They're not stupid. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9934.300000000001s)]
*  They're not stupid. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9935.300000000001s)]
*  They're scary animals, but they're also amazing. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9936.98s)]
*  But you've got to keep an eye on them. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9940.98s)]
*  People that live in cities don't think that. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9944.380000000001s)]
*  It goes back to be suspicious. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9946.380000000001s)]
*  Our theme for today, be suspicious. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9947.380000000001s)]
*  Well, be suspicious of systems, right? [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9948.380000000001s)]
*  Because that is a system of predator and prey. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9950.78s)]
*  If you're having a hard time walking up that hill, guess what? [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9953.26s)]
*  Someone will take your eye out there. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9956.220000000001s)]
*  Guess what side you're on? [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9959.18s)]
*  You think you're a predator? [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9960.18s)]
*  You're not. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9961.18s)]
*  You're not. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9962.18s)]
*  You can't even get up the hill. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9963.18s)]
*  Wolves run up a hill like it's nothing. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9965.220000000001s)]
*  Like, whee! [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9966.220000000001s)]
*  They just fucking go over that hill like it ain't shit. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9967.220000000001s)]
*  They can run 45 miles an hour and chase you down and eat you, stupid. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9969.74s)]
*  Be suspicious. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9975.94s)]
*  Be suspicious. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9976.94s)]
*  Did they teach you guys when you were doing the survival training how to do everything [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9977.94s)]
*  like get water, hunt for food, make your own fire? [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9982.02s)]
*  I know how to distill water in a pit from plants and how to distill urine and all that [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9987.38s)]
*  great stuff. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9994.86s)]
*  Wow. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9995.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9996.86s)]
*  It's not really a very practical skill though. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9997.86s)]
*  You don't really have to do that on a daily basis. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=9998.86s)]
*  But if you know how to distill water, it's pretty wise. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10001.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10004.5s)]
*  I mean, you can do a lot with dew. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10005.5s)]
*  Just like by putting, you do need a piece of plastic. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10007.22s)]
*  You can use a rain jacket or a windbreaker or whatever, but you dig a pit and you put [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10009.14s)]
*  all the vegetation and like whatever you can get even in the desert. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10014.5s)]
*  Like if you can get, you know, yucca or whatever and you put it in the pit and then the condensation, [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10017.179999999998s)]
*  you know, when it rises, you need to collect it and then you can collect the dew and survive. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10021.66s)]
*  So you get it off the bottom surface of the plastic? [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10025.38s)]
*  Yeah, but you make a little like pool of it and you, yeah. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10027.46s)]
*  Damn. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10031.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10032.46s)]
*  And you can survive off of that. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10033.46s)]
*  Wow. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10035.74s)]
*  How much water can you get out of dew? [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10036.74s)]
*  Well it depends on how you, ideally you have more than one pit of this, but you are going [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10039.06s)]
*  to need to at some point move on a little and forge where there's more plants. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10042.539999999999s)]
*  But you can live and you also of course want to know what plants can give you water. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10045.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10050.22s)]
*  Until you can find a source of water. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10051.22s)]
*  What's the good ones? [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10052.22s)]
*  They're like which good plants? [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10053.22s)]
*  So what's the good ones that will give you water? [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10055.22s)]
*  Any, the darker green and the, you know, the bigger the leaf, but in the desert, I mean, [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10057.019999999999s)]
*  generally if you have the things that give you a lot of water are already at water sources, [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10062.06s)]
*  right? [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10066.019999999999s)]
*  Because that's, they're water rich. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10067.019999999999s)]
*  So it's in the desert where you need it and anything that has, I mean, cactus can give [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10068.019999999999s)]
*  you water, but you're not going to get as much dew as you do off of let's say sagebrush. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10071.580000000002s)]
*  So sage bushes. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10076.7s)]
*  Yeah, you can get some dew off of that. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10077.7s)]
*  So what do you do? [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10079.54s)]
*  You take them out of the dirt? [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10080.54s)]
*  You bury them? [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10081.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10082.54s)]
*  You dig a pit. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10083.54s)]
*  You don't bury them like they would grow. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10084.54s)]
*  You leave them like lush. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10085.54s)]
*  So you dig this pit so you can use it over and over. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10086.54s)]
*  And you take the brush and you put it in the pit and then you cover it with whatever, you [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10088.580000000002s)]
*  know, sort of plastic you have. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10093.300000000001s)]
*  If you have a tarp, that's great. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10094.300000000001s)]
*  I just don't know why you'd have a tarp. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10095.300000000001s)]
*  Are you planting it or are you just leaving it there? [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10096.300000000001s)]
*  You're not planting it because you didn't, yeah, it's just you don't need the roots. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10098.5s)]
*  So it's just sucking the water out of that plant as it dehydrates in the heat with the [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10101.5s)]
*  plastic over it and the water. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10107.42s)]
*  But it's overnight. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10108.42s)]
*  So it's not really the heat. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10109.42s)]
*  I mean, it's yeah. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10110.42s)]
*  So it'll like you've seen condensation like even on your car. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10111.42s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10114.3s)]
*  And so you're just collecting that. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10115.3s)]
*  That's just a source of collecting it. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10116.3s)]
*  And you put more of it in one place so you can collect more. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10117.86s)]
*  How much can you get? [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10120.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, if you get a quarter cup, you're pretty lucky. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10121.1s)]
*  Wow. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10124.98s)]
*  But you know, you just can't move around a lot if you don't want to dehydrate. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10125.98s)]
*  But if you do that enough, you can live. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10129.460000000001s)]
*  You'll survive for a while. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10132.34s)]
*  Water is really important, way more important than food. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10133.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10135.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10136.34s)]
*  I mean, you know that. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10137.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10138.34s)]
*  You could survive a long time without food. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10139.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10140.34s)]
*  We talked about this dude that was really fat and he went on a fasting diet with IV vitamins [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10141.34s)]
*  and he did it for 300 and something days. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10146.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10148.94s)]
*  So you can do a whole year if you're heavy enough. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10149.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10150.94s)]
*  But most people could go a month pretty easily. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10151.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10153.54s)]
*  Like even if you're not fat. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10154.54s)]
*  Yeah, you'd look like shit at the end. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10155.54s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10156.54s)]
*  But you could live. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10157.54s)]
*  You can't do that with water. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10158.660000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10159.660000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10160.660000000002s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10163.660000000002s)]
*  I'm sure you hope you don't ever have to use those skills. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10164.660000000002s)]
*  I do hope that. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10166.460000000001s)]
*  And I am sure my skills are not as good as they used to be. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10167.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but just what you've told so far, if the shit hits the fan, I'm calling you. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10170.300000000001s)]
*  You should. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10173.740000000002s)]
*  You should, Joe. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10174.740000000002s)]
*  I bet I should. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10175.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10176.740000000002s)]
*  I mean, how many years did you have to learn that stuff? [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10177.740000000002s)]
*  I mean, I learned them for a lot of years and it gets inside of you. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10181.220000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the thing about muscle memory, right? [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10183.42s)]
*  And I believe in exercise, by the way, too. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10185.740000000002s)]
*  I mean, I was trained like that, so I can't not exercise. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10187.46s)]
*  And I think that just like exercise, like I'm sure you feel like shit if you don't exercise. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10190.66s)]
*  And as do I. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10195.019999999999s)]
*  But I also feel like when it gets inside of you, like what survival is, you feel, I think [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10196.019999999999s)]
*  without doing some of those things, that you're not really fully human. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10200.419999999998s)]
*  At least I feel that way. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10203.22s)]
*  Wow. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10205.22s)]
*  Yeah, I like to eat off the earth even now. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10206.22s)]
*  Like when I can, you know, I still force. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10208.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's what picnics about. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10210.619999999999s)]
*  Aren't they? [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10212.619999999999s)]
*  No, I meant like actually picking things out of the ground that I didn't plan. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10213.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, gardening. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10217.9s)]
*  I mean, you know, like foraging off the land. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10218.9s)]
*  If you know what to eat, it's still really great to have something that grew there naturally, [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10220.26s)]
*  like indigenous plants. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10225.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's rewarding. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10226.220000000001s)]
*  If you can find a blueberry bush and pick blueberries, it's rewarding. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10227.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, elderberries. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10230.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a part of our past, too. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10231.06s)]
*  Like in our DNA, you get excited. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10232.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10235.02s)]
*  Every chapter of my book has like these descriptions of something you can eat in the Angeles National [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10236.02s)]
*  Forest. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10241.54s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10242.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10243.54s)]
*  I mean, not to say that, you know, somebody would need a little bit of training. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10244.54s)]
*  Like I'm not advocating that you just go out there and like, you know, but I mean, if [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10247.3s)]
*  you know what you're doing, yeah. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10250.66s)]
*  Yeah, you always hear that with mushrooms, like people fuck up and they eat the wrong [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10251.66s)]
*  mushrooms and wind up dying. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10255.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10256.619999999999s)]
*  Mushrooms are scary. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10257.78s)]
*  They are. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10258.78s)]
*  There's a lot of them that will kill you. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10259.78s)]
*  Yes. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10261.539999999999s)]
*  And then there's a lot of them will keep you alive. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10262.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10263.539999999999s)]
*  So if you're going to survive, you should know the difference. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10264.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10265.539999999999s)]

*  Wow. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10274.34s)]
*  It came off old growth forest. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10275.34s)]
*  Wow. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10277.06s)]
*  That's a real mushroom. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10278.06s)]
*  That's incredible. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10279.06s)]
*  Isn't that nuts? [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10280.06s)]
*  Don't eat it. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10281.06s)]
*  No, you don't eat that one. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10282.06s)]
*  Don't stay on the table. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10283.06s)]
*  I'm just giving you some advice. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10284.06s)]

*  He actually, yeah, his company is called Host Defense. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10288.06s)]
*  You get it in pill form. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10291.54s)]
*  It's good for your immune system. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10293.54s)]
*  All right. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10295.54s)]
*  So it's foraging, I think. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10296.54s)]
*  I think so too. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10297.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10298.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10299.54s)]
*  I'm sure even just getting dirt on you and being in the wild and like, that's what we're [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10300.54s)]
*  supposed to do, right? [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10304.06s)]
*  Being in sterile environments is probably the worst thing for your immune system. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10305.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10309.34s)]
*  It's like atrophy. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10310.34s)]
*  That's actually been studied, yes. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10311.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10312.34s)]
*  Just sort of like exercise, right? [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10313.34s)]
*  If you don't exercise, you're atrophy. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGY6HfkENg&t=10314.34s)]
