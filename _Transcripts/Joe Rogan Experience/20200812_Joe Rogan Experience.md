# Joe Rogan Experience #1523 - Joey Diaz & Brian Redban
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 12, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INSy7D2LBfU)
*  I have not had a drink.
*  The whole fucking, the whole COVID.
*  I didn't drink before that either.
*  No, you weren't much of a drinker.
*  It's fucking, every night I go home I'm gonna have a make up because that, I think it makes
*  a light.
*  Five points.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Tremendous.
*  They make a double zero that actually tastes good.
*  Zero alcohol.
*  It's the best, Heineken has for sure the best non-alcoholic beer.
*  It tastes like fucking beer.
*  Like if you were an alcoholic you'd be like oh my god I fucked up.
*  Like you know how you have those, like I like old duals.
*  It tastes good.
*  But it doesn't taste like beer.
*  A cold old duals is delicious.
*  I like those non-alcoholic.
*  I do.
*  Some people don't like them.
*  I like them.
*  Like a cold one is really nice.
*  You know what you're doing.
*  With the Heineken they kind of trick you.
*  I don't know what the fuck they're doing.
*  They're doing some weird shit.
*  Because it tastes like, tastes like beer.
*  Well beer is like a taste kind of.
*  That's why duals work.
*  It's kind of like that smoke juice you put in meat.
*  Like oh that's the taste of smoke.
*  Right.
*  Or like watermelon gum.
*  That shit don't taste like watermelon.
*  No.
*  It's still good.
*  But you know what it is.
*  It's so crazy how beer, like I grew up on six packs and eight packs.
*  Eight packs with eight ounces.
*  Yeah.
*  Nips.
*  Or a case of beer.
*  And then you went out to Colorado and they had 3.2.
*  3.2?
*  Alcohol.
*  Low alcohol beer.
*  If you're on the.
*  Like Utah.
*  Between 18 and 21.
*  Oh really?
*  That's it.
*  You have to drink.
*  Then when you turn 21 they give you the full dose.
*  There used to be a club on the hill.
*  I forget what it was.
*  In the University of Boulder downstairs.
*  And that's what they served you.
*  3.2 beer.
*  Right around the time I was turning 18 was the time they made it 21 years old.
*  I'm pretty sure.
*  Find out when they did it in Massachusetts.
*  When did Massachusetts make the drinking age from 18 to 21?
*  I feel like I missed it by like a year or two.
*  But probably for good.
*  They were like Jesus Christ.
*  I remember that when I was in elementary.
*  People were mad about that.
*  They at least make it harder for them.
*  Fucking animals.
*  Thank you for the COVID test.
*  My pleasure.
*  I did the blood test.
*  Okay.
*  It's 1979.
*  They've raised the drinking age from 18 to 20.
*  Huh.
*  But when was it 21?
*  Oh okay.
*  84.
*  84.
*  Exactly.
*  Okay.
*  So 84 I was 17.
*  That son of a bitch.
*  And he raised it from 20 to 21.
*  Dukakis also fucked up.
*  He gave out furloughs to prisoners and one escaped and killed somebody.
*  So when I got into a halfway house.
*  Wasn't it?
*  Somebody.
*  When I got to a halfway house everybody was mad at Dukakis.
*  Because you couldn't have furloughs no more.
*  Oh.
*  He used to furlough prisoners.
*  Yes.
*  What about it?
*  It was Willie something or another right?
*  I forget the whole story but I know that people in prison were furious because they
*  couldn't go to fucking unfurloughs no more.
*  Dukakis let them go for like four days like a fucking you know like Club Med for four
*  days.
*  He's a fucking prisoner.
*  I ain't gonna let him go to Club Med.
*  And that was the end of that tune.
*  Well they're releasing a lot of prisoners right now because of COVID.
*  They're opening up the doors.
*  18,000 in California.
*  Did you hear that one that just.
*  They came out of jail and shot the motherfucker who accused them.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if this is the best idea kids.
*  There's a lot of those people who are very violent.
*  It depends on what you're letting out.
*  If you're letting out some dude who sold weed you should have let him out a long time ago.
*  You know you're letting out some guy who's selling mushrooms.
*  Let that guy out.
*  Don't keep him in a fucking cage with people who are murderers.
*  We've had this conversation before.
*  You gotta let out the people that are nonviolent drug offenders.
*  Yes.
*  All of them.
*  They're not offenders first time.
*  First time offenders unless.
*  You know there's this.
*  You know what the big thing in jail is sometimes when you go to county.
*  There's a big DUI population.
*  Really?
*  There's motherfuckers that can't stop getting DUIs.
*  I think my ex brother-in-law has the record in Colorado.
*  I'm not making a joke here.
*  Like there's people that stay in the system because of the DUI problem.
*  You know they gotta blow into a tube before they start their car.
*  My friend Robbie has that.
*  Yeah they got all types of shit.
*  And then they put you on work release.
*  That's a complete different situation.
*  Then you know they have different levels of it.
*  They're blowing into the thing.
*  It takes some time too.
*  He couldn't just start his car.
*  So if it was cold out like we were playing pool and I go how long does that take?
*  He's like it takes like five minutes.
*  You just gotta sit here.
*  Because it has to check to see to make you all right.
*  And you can't there's no getaways.
*  Like if someone's chasing you.
*  You hop in the car you gotta blow on the thing to get the car to start.
*  I had a friend that did that.
*  He used to just pay people five dollars to blow in there.
*  He would get hammered.
*  Come here what are you doing?
*  Blow in there.
*  Do you know what happened in Chicago?
*  Do you have an idea what happened this weekend in Chicago?
*  No.
*  Oh about the...
*  The crazy...
*  Yeah yeah yeah.
*  There was a shooting and then there was some crazy looting.
*  They've broken the Tesla.
*  And Jamie was the first one to tell me that there was like an incorrect story.
*  The incorrect story was that a 14 year old girl was shot.
*  Is that what it was?
*  Or a 15 year old girl was shot?
*  I heard yeah a 15 year old was shot and killed by the police.
*  But it was misinformation that was...
*  I don't know how that got out or who put it out initially.
*  I didn't find out that part of it.
*  But it was actually a 20 year old that was not killed and was in the hospital.
*  So I don't know.
*  Yeah we're one of those away.
*  We're one of those away from this whole fucking thing exploding in different cities again.
*  Why do you feel this strongly about Los Angeles lately?
*  I've seen you make a telling very...
*  Ever since the Houston trip you've been a different person.
*  Well I've been thinking about it for quite a while.
*  I've been thinking about leaving LA for a while.
*  I think...
*  This is just my feeling.
*  I don't think this is a healthy way to live.
*  I don't think it's good for your brain.
*  I really don't.
*  Which part of it?
*  I think the people that live here...
*  I wonder if it's a coincidence that so many people that live in cities have like...
*  Cities are always democratic.
*  Almost always.
*  Cities are rarely Republican.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  I don't know.
*  Is Houston like that?
*  That's a pretty big city.
*  Dallas is a pretty big city.
*  But I think they might be blue.
*  I think the cities might be blue.
*  And then the states are all...
*  The surrounding area is red.
*  Me and Jamie grew up red.
*  I wonder...
*  But I always used to think that that was because they were smarter.
*  I think that they were more educated.
*  So they were more likely to be Democrats.
*  Because my family was Democrats growing up.
*  And I always felt like that was the people who were really interested in freedom of speech.
*  Really interested in education.
*  Really interested in welfare.
*  And making programs for poor people.
*  And prison reform.
*  They didn't want the death penalty.
*  They wanted you to have the right to choose.
*  That's what it was always to me.
*  So why the fuck are they all like lumped up in cities?
*  Like what is that?
*  Because that's where all the universities are.
*  But there's some universities that are in the middle of nowhere too.
*  It's weird.
*  It's weird how cities are like...
*  If you just...
*  Forget if you had a dog in the fight.
*  If you're just looking at people.
*  It's odd.
*  That these big giant clumps are almost always the lean Democrat.
*  It's weird.
*  And then when shit like what's going on now happens.
*  Where you have violent reactions on a regular basis.
*  Like on a regular basis there's riots.
*  On a regular basis.
*  There's crazy shit going on in Portland, Seattle.
*  They're trying to burn federal buildings.
*  This isn't rare.
*  This is like every day.
*  You're totally accustomed to it.
*  Have you noticed?
*  You see a fucking looting and a riot and a building on fire on TV.
*  You don't even flinch.
*  You don't even flinch.
*  That used to be a big deal.
*  Right?
*  Remember like the Waco days?
*  That was a big fucking deal.
*  There was a standoff with the feds and a compound.
*  And there was a guy who thought he was Jesus who was fucking everybody's wife.
*  And they had guns.
*  And you're like holy shit.
*  Waco was fucked up.
*  Why do you use Waco?
*  Well Hicks was alive because Hicks talked about it on stage.
*  So it had to be pre-1990s.
*  I think Hicks died in like 1993 in that area.
*  It was like Hicks and Kinnison died within a couple of years of each other.
*  It was Waco and then the Oklahoma City bombing which blew our fucking minds.
*  Waco, 1993.
*  Okay.
*  1993 and then 1994-95 was the Oklahoma City bombings which really fucked with me that
*  week.
*  I snorted a lot of coke.
*  The Oklahoma City bombings were very interesting.
*  Very interesting that week.
*  Very interesting.
*  There's a lot of weird stuff.
*  But it was 1995.
*  I was still living in Boulder.
*  Do you see that building?
*  Look at the building.
*  There's people to this day that don't believe that that was just a car filled with some
*  sort of explosive that did that.
*  Damn.
*  The most thing I remember that fucked with me.
*  They say it's too uniform.
*  It was a daycare on the basement.
*  That's what destroyed me that week.
*  And I remember I bought a big batch of coke and I cut it and I was trying to sell it.
*  And I did the whole bag in four fucking days.
*  Just watching the coverage on this.
*  There are some fucking insane people out there.
*  And there are people that are so insane they'll plant a bomb in front of a building and blow
*  the whole side of it up.
*  They don't give a fuck who's inside.
*  Timothy McVeigh.
*  Yeah.
*  And then they had the Unabomber around that time.
*  Look at how it blew.
*  That's crazy.
*  So there was all these reports.
*  The problem is like eyewitness reports after traumatic events like that, they're always
*  off.
*  People always like, you know, they don't know what they saw.
*  They're so fucked up.
*  And you can tell them what they saw and then they'll repeat what you said.
*  It does happen with people.
*  When there's a big crazy explosion like that, people, so you don't know who's telling the
*  truth and who's, but there was a lot of people that were saying they saw people carrying
*  off bombs that were unexploded.
*  They saw the FBI carrying off bombs.
*  That there was more than one bomb.
*  And then the way it looks, if you look at the way the building exploded, the way they
*  were explaining, I was watching something on it, that the way one of those bombs would
*  go off, if it was just a fertilizer bomb, like it wouldn't necessarily go off that way,
*  where it looks like the whole side of the building is going out, you know, that it would
*  be located, the blast would be, all the damage would be where the truck was located.
*  But being a moron and not knowing shit about explosives, I don't know if that's true,
*  but it does get interesting.
*  Who gave him this information?
*  Why is he blowing up that building?
*  What the fuck is going on?
*  You could do that with a truck and some manure?
*  Is that real?
*  That's a hell of a fucking bomb.
*  Can you do that?
*  Could any crazy fuck just fill a pickup truck up, fill with fertilizer, do what they have
*  to do to light it on fire and make it explode and blow up a building like that?
*  Was that a young guy was a suicider or he just left it there and detonated it?
*  I think he just left it there.
*  Left it and detonated it.
*  Then they caught him, the one guy that was a pair.
*  They were part of a paramilitary group in the hills of Michigan or some shit.
*  Something extra spooky about those white dudes who live in the woods who are plotting to
*  overthrow the government.
*  Right?
*  There's something extra spooky about those guys.
*  And that's what you think of when you think of Timothy McVeigh, think of those kind of
*  people.
*  Those people like, it's a real sad story.
*  You ever hear the Ruby Ridge story?
*  No.
*  That was a real sad one.
*  That was a guy who got in a standoff with the cops, with the federales, and they fucking
*  shot his wife while she was holding the baby.
*  I forget exactly what they were after him for.
*  I forget exactly what it was, but it was an egregious overuse of power.
*  They murdered these people.
*  And the snipers murdered these people.
*  And the people eventually shot back.
*  And then, I mean, it's just a bloodbath.
*  But it became a symbol of how if you give people that kind of power, you don't know
*  exactly how they're going to wield it.
*  You give people the power to pull guns out and storm some fucking cabin in the middle
*  of the woods.
*  Some people are more than willing to shoot people.
*  Did you ever see this story?
*  It's Tony Kuritsis.
*  What is it?
*  This was a live press conference that got put on every news channel.
*  A friend of mine sent this to me recently.
*  There's a whole YouTube series about it.
*  I think it's maybe even on Amazon Prime.
*  What's going on?
*  He's really mad at this dude.
*  I think he was his mortgage broker or something like that.
*  He got taken advantage of, and so he kidnapped him.
*  It's like a four-day ordeal.
*  Oh my God.
*  And he took over all the airwaves to get his story heard.
*  Oh my God.
*  I started looking into it the other day.
*  It was insane.
*  I'd never even heard of it.
*  It was in 1979 or something, 77.
*  Is he still alive?
*  What's his yelp look like?
*  I actually think he might still be alive.
*  When I looked him up, I think he was alive.
*  Holy shit.
*  This is the creepiest start to any podcast I've ever been on in my life.
*  Buildings blowing up.
*  We were cheers.
*  Some poor fucking governor with a gun to his fucking head.
*  What the fuck is going on here?
*  What the fuck is going on here?
*  I just did a COVID test.
*  I feel good.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  And all of a sudden I come into bombs and fucking explosions.
*  Where's the happiness?
*  It's your birthday, cocksucker.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thank you very much.
*  I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  I'm going to the bathroom.
*  I'm going to the bathroom.
*  I'm going to the bathroom.
*  I'm going to the bathroom.
*  Happy birthday to me.
*  We're getting the fuck out of here because all you need to do is hook a fucking left
*  on La Cienega and then hook another left on Melrose and drive and play a game.
*  Let's count the four lease signs.
*  You can't just shut things down.
*  Think about the last time you were at the Improv.
*  Close your eyes and think about the last time you were at the Melrose Improv.
*  When you go to Melrose now, think of the last time you were there and think of how long
*  it's going to take for Melrose to be like that again.
*  Melrose was destroyed already.
*  That is why I am leaving because of things like this.
*  I see an 18-month comeback and that's a guy with a GED.
*  I see it.
*  It's going to take, let's say we go April.
*  That's assuming everything goes well.
*  That's assuming everything goes well and everybody does the vaccine or some people say it's going
*  to disappear November on election day.
*  It's going to just disappear.
*  I don't fucking know either.
*  I don't fucking know either.
*  I'm looking at this as an 18-month recovery.
*  West Hollywood is going to be last because of the supermarket situation.
*  They had 29 infected employees and they spread it throughout the community in Hollywood.
*  West Hollywood is going to be last.
*  Did you know that?
*  That all those bars are going to be last.
*  So I'm sorry to give you the fucking bad news.
*  Joey, you just went off on Joe about starting this podcast off with bad news and now you
*  made me feel worse.
*  We're talking about why we're leaving here.
*  We're talking about why we're leaving.
*  Why we're leaving.
*  That's why.
*  And the other thing that bothered me was the no school.
*  Burbank ain't bad right now.
*  Burbank ain't bad.
*  You're homeless for 24 hours there and then you disappear.
*  Let me tell you something about Burbank.
*  Every time I go to Burbank, just to look around, I got friends that live in Burbank.
*  I go to two areas of Burbank.
*  I go down Magnolia to Victory by Albertos and I see that street is getting very eerie.
*  Like when you go on that street you feel two things are coming.
*  An earthquake.
*  Every time I'm on Magnolia I think of an earthquake.
*  This is good earthquake weather for some reason by the donut hut.
*  And then you see those people lining up for guns.
*  There's three stores in the world.
*  Oh there's three of them right around me.
*  Joe Rogan.
*  That's crazy.
*  I was driving the other day at 9.30 in the morning.
*  There was a big line in front of Petersons trying to buy guns.
*  It's crazy.
*  I follow all the gun shops around me and they all have Instagrams of course and they show
*  all the guns they got in for the day and I'm like oh you know I might get one of those
*  and then like an hour later it's sold out like shoes.
*  There's a line constantly on all three of those guns.
*  How fucking sad is that?
*  Well this is what's sad.
*  What's sad is I mean now we know.
*  We didn't have a plan if everything went sideways like this and you can't like governors and
*  mayors it's their fault right but it's not their fault because really that fucking job
*  is a ridiculous job in a pandemic.
*  Like all of a sudden there's a new problem that's presented with you.
*  You don't have the resources to fix it.
*  People are not going to listen.
*  They're going to want to party.
*  They're going to want to still go out.
*  They're going to do it.
*  And you're in this situation where you know a large percent it didn't turn out to be as
*  bad as we thought it was but they thought it was going to be a large percentage of our
*  population could possibly die and you don't have the resources.
*  And what do you do?
*  And governors even though they are in that position they're in that position because
*  they got elected.
*  They're not in that position because they passed a battery of tests and show that they
*  know exactly how to respond to any given circumstance.
*  They were charismatic.
*  They had the right money behind them.
*  They said the right things.
*  They backed the right bills and then you become a mayor and then you become a governor.
*  But it doesn't mean you know what to do if things go sideways and no one knows what to
*  do.
*  And the fact that they were always getting those checks they're always getting those
*  checks no matter what happened no matter what shut down they kept getting those government
*  checks and they told all these other people they couldn't work.
*  Like you can't.
*  That's not a plan.
*  That's not a sustainable plan.
*  You can't tell people you can't work but I'm going to keep getting paid and I'm going
*  to tell you when you can go back to work again because people are going to go fuck you.
*  You can't just keep everything shut down for five months.
*  That is California.
*  I don't know what the proper response would have been.
*  I don't know.
*  But this wasn't it.
*  This is wasn't the best case scenario.
*  And again not a fucking word about your health not a word about taking vitamin D not a word
*  about exercise not a word about drink water not a word about cut out sugar not a word
*  about use this as an opportunity to lose weight.
*  We have to up our metabolic health.
*  We have to be we have to take vitamins.
*  We have to be better about our health.
*  Not one word.
*  Everything's wear a mask and you can't do this and you can't do that.
*  Don't open this and don't open that.
*  And look they weren't prepared.
*  That's all it is.
*  They're not bad people.
*  Like people think that they wanted to sabotage the state or sabotage the city.
*  I'm sure Garcetti and Newsom are nice guys.
*  They probably are fine to hang out with.
*  The problem is nobody was ready.
*  Nobody knew what the fuck this was.
*  I can't hang out with Garcetti.
*  He says he says Los Angeles knows too much.
*  Leave it alone.
*  Angelino's.
*  Angelino's.
*  He drives me fucking crazy.
*  Newsom Newsom looks like you could smoke a joint with him.
*  Maybe.
*  And talk to him and he'll go you're right.
*  I fucked up.
*  But Garcetti's too.
*  What about the fucking DA's husband's getting charged with assault because.
*  What?
*  What happened?
*  Jackie Lacey's husband is getting charged with a misdemeanor assault because when they
*  went to his house to protest that brother pulled out a piece.
*  Did he really?
*  Said get the fuck away from my door.
*  They took a picture of him and they charged him with misdemeanor.
*  Whatever assault.
*  The DA's husband.
*  My God.
*  It's just been you know.
*  Mayor of or the head of police of Seattle just quit.
*  Yeah that motherfucker tapped.
*  He sent a letter out.
*  Lady.
*  Yeah.
*  She says cuts.
*  She sent a letter out.
*  Eight million dollars.
*  Well you know the cops they see the writing on the wall for whatever reason people decide
*  they hate cops now.
*  It's look.
*  There's bad people in every fucking job.
*  You know the problem with being a bad cop is it can ruin a person's entire life.
*  Ruin the life of a family.
*  When you see someone abuse someone like that like what we saw it's natural to get upset.
*  We all got upset.
*  But it's not every cop.
*  And I think that's a crazy way of looking things and they're figuring that out right
*  now in New York.
*  And New York has record crime man.
*  New York is off going off the fucking hook.
*  My friend John Joseph you know he lives in New York.
*  He's always sending me updates you know.
*  It's off the fucking chain.
*  It's crazy.
*  And John's never left.
*  He's been you know he's the lead singer of the Chrome acts hardcore dude does triathlons
*  and he's not going anywhere.
*  You're not kicking him out.
*  But he's you know he sends me his updates on crime.
*  Nobody gives a fuck.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's like these guys I mean the criminals they don't give a fuck.
*  They're stealing catalytic converters in my neighborhood.
*  Yeah.
*  Catalytic converters are going like fucking hotcakes now.
*  That's so crazy.
*  I thought of stealing crazy shit.
*  How much does that work?
*  When I was doing coke I was thinking about bringing it to the White House.
*  Shit like that.
*  But who would rob a fucking catalytic converter right off the street.
*  They melt them down to platinum.
*  They sell it.
*  And that's how they're making a living.
*  Studio City the last week they've been hitting neighborhoods.
*  So if you park it on the street they clip your catalytic converter.
*  How weird.
*  But it's great.
*  Everyone has Nest cams now and home security cameras.
*  So like next door has become my new fetish of just watching people's home security of
*  like people walking in the neighborhood doing nothing.
*  That's crazy.
*  This guy looks suspicious.
*  Let me tell you guys a fact.
*  Our friend from martial arts school got robbed the other night.
*  Yeah.
*  What'd they steal?
*  She caught it on camera.
*  She dialed 911.
*  They put her on hold for an hour.
*  What?
*  So you're dead.
*  You're dead buddy.
*  Always call the non-emergency line by the way.
*  And always press 2.
*  And always press 2.
*  You want them to Spanish.
*  They pick up quicker.
*  For you fucking unemployment dubbies that haven't gotten unemployment.
*  You just gave up the secret.
*  You got a pat.
*  I don't need unemployment no more.
*  You gotta press 2.
*  Speak your Spanish.
*  They get answered quicker.
*  You dumb fucks.
*  You learned something new with Uncle Joey.
*  Why are you pressing 1?
*  If you didn't say press 2 if you speak Spanish the lady's gonna answer.
*  And you're gonna talk to her like half way like Minosabe.
*  And she'll fucking give you your paperwork.
*  And next thing you know you got your unemployment.
*  But everybody presses 1 like a fucking nutmeg.
*  Think about that next time.
*  Think about press Spanish.
*  And see how quick they fucking pick up the phone.
*  Isn't it crazy how everybody went from everything's great.
*  The economy's great.
*  We hate Trump but other than that things are great.
*  But that was like that was how the country was.
*  And then all of a sudden everybody wants a gun.
*  Same people.
*  Same people.
*  It's because people are actually scared.
*  They're watching that video of live footage.
*  You know that scared a lot of people.
*  They also know people who have died.
*  So they're scared to go to work.
*  There's that too right?
*  That compounds it.
*  Everybody knows somebody who's gone because of COVID or knows somebody.
*  That tastes tremendous by the way.
*  I don't know who made that.
*  Buffalo Trace.
*  It's the shit.
*  It is great.
*  Fucking delicious.
*  Yeah it's very good.
*  If I didn't have to drive I'd have 9 more.
*  This shit is older than America.
*  This company started in 1773.
*  That is fucking delicious.
*  Where they at of?
*  Kentucky.
*  Buffalo Trace.
*  You do 2 more of those.
*  They used to make booze during the when it was illegal.
*  They did it for medicinal reasons.
*  I didn't know they had a weed scam.
*  Like they have a weed scam today.
*  They used to have a booze scam.
*  Same thing.
*  They used to steal whiskey for medicinal purposes.
*  Like a doctor could prescribe it.
*  Like Brian you need a drink.
*  Thanks doc.
*  You go to the doctor and cut your script for some whiskey I guess.
*  What the fuck did they use whiskey for for medicinal purposes?
*  I used to drink Jack and pull my teeth out.
*  When I didn't have insurance.
*  When I was a young comic.
*  If I had a toothache on the way home I'd stop and get a little pint of Jack.
*  Two shots gargle with it and work the tooth.
*  A couple of bumps to numb the head and you're fucking good to go.
*  It was terrible.
*  Something about losing your teeth that's extra creepy.
*  Listen to me dog.
*  From the cocaine drip.
*  From all those years.
*  Right at the end.
*  Nobody really caught it.
*  You gotta watch an episode of My Name is Earl.
*  When I go I sing a song at the end.
*  Tim Stacks what you gonna do.
*  Look at my tooth.
*  My tooth is black.
*  I had already quit coke two weeks and all of a sudden like a month later I see that
*  episode and I'm like oh shit.
*  Your tooth was dead?
*  I got a cocaine tooth.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  From the nerve.
*  Nobody caught it.
*  So I went to the doctor for something different.
*  It was like the 22nd of December.
*  And he was like a Beverly Hills dentist.
*  Like this idiot sent me to like the you know your friend's dentist.
*  Jamie from My Name is Earl.
*  He has the movie stars and shit.
*  They sent me there.
*  I'm no movie star.
*  You gotta pay 200 just to walk in there.
*  So I went in there for something different.
*  And the doctor said to me what are you gonna do about that little other cocaine tooth.
*  And he goes yeah I had one of those at one time.
*  That's the best when the doctor cops are doing drugs.
*  How many doctors copped are doing drugs?
*  I got two of them that have copped to me.
*  Wow.
*  Four.
*  Four.
*  One that I grew up and I would see him out of clubs.
*  And he'd come up to me.
*  I was 21.
*  He was like 50.
*  And he'd come up to me and he'd go what do you got for the head in Spanish.
*  In Cuban miss.
*  He used to say.
*  And I'd go aspirin.
*  And he'd go.
*  And he'd walk away from me.
*  My one family doctor whenever I went to see him.
*  I was the best 20 years of my doctor.
*  I couldn't give him nothing hand to hand.
*  But I walked into his office.
*  Put it on his desk.
*  And then I go to the examination room.
*  I never gave him a blow.
*  I just gave him like lollipops.
*  And brownies.
*  I remember one time I went in and he's like listen man.
*  I found one of your brownies one night and I ate it.
*  Holy shit.
*  Next thing you know I was making a steak sandwich at four in the morning.
*  What the fuck was in that thing.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And then my heart doctor now.
*  He's the best.
*  That's the best doctor I've ever had.
*  He's got three stents in his heart from doing blow.
*  He's so quail ludes in Chicago.
*  He's a fucking nut.
*  But I love him.
*  Love him to death.
*  Joey what do you think happens to the country?
*  Me?
*  Yeah.
*  How does this.
*  When you look at it.
*  How does this even out?
*  Listen first of all.
*  I'm going to be as honest I can with you.
*  I don't know what red means and what blue means.
*  I've never.
*  I grew up hanging out with guys that were Democrats.
*  I ripped signs down as a kid for people.
*  I did all that political dirty shit as a kid.
*  And guess what?
*  By the age of 13 I saw the theft at the municipal level.
*  I couldn't imagine the thievery at the presidential, the senatorial level and the governor level.
*  I couldn't imagine what the thievery was.
*  I saw it firsthand as a child.
*  I was involved with it.
*  I saw the payoffs.
*  I went to Long Island with this family.
*  I saw all this shit.
*  I saw how things got done.
*  So I lost my faith in it.
*  I don't really believe it.
*  I think it's all a bunch of bullshit.
*  Joe Rogan is running for president.
*  I got a drug that is going to hook people.
*  It's going to fuck people up.
*  I donate five million to Joe Rogan.
*  Joe Rogan makes a few calls and gets that drug passed.
*  And every year I donate five million to Joe Rogan.
*  It's a little more complicated than that.
*  But that's in the same fucking neighborhood.
*  Yeah, it's in the same neighborhood.
*  You're right.
*  It's in the same fucking neighborhood.
*  No, I'm agreeing with you.
*  You buy yourself into this.
*  You know what?
*  As far as politics, I never trusted.
*  So disclaim me as a politician.
*  I'm talking about as a human being.
*  I see a lot of despair.
*  I see a lot of fear.
*  I see, you know, yesterday somebody put a thing up and they said that they shut the
*  clubs down in San Diego.
*  And I go, thank fucking God.
*  And a lot of people said shit to me.
*  And I'm like, I'm not saying because of that.
*  I'm saying because of the social despair.
*  I think that if you're in a park and you're not doing comedy and a guy just went home
*  and his wife broke up with him and all of a sudden he checks the mail, he's losing the
*  house and he gets in his car to go for a ride.
*  You know how many farmers markets do people get hit at with cars?
*  Especially lately.
*  People have been running through people lately.
*  I don't want to see some guy run through a parking lot in La Jolla and hit a bunch of
*  people watching a comic or a comic.
*  Right now is not a time to do comedy.
*  You know what?
*  People want to laugh, but their moral compass is off.
*  We're confused.
*  Do we wear a mask?
*  Do we not wear a mask?
*  Is there a disease?
*  Am I going to get unemployment?
*  Am I going to get evicted?
*  There's a lot of things going on in people's minds.
*  You know, people snap on daily basis is just getting caught on the 405.
*  About you know, expect a huge amount of people losing it.
*  You got to be well grounded.
*  Thank God I do copy you.
*  I get up in the morning, I do some shit, I do two bong and I got on a mountain bike.
*  I can't hike.
*  But I got on a mountain bike.
*  And I go all the way to cold water.
*  Beautiful.
*  And I come back and I get vitamin D and then I wash my pussy.
*  And then I do what I got to go do.
*  So I get all that shit out of the way.
*  I don't watch no TV.
*  I don't want to hear it no more.
*  You put COVID, anything, World News Tonight is number one watch show.
*  Why?
*  Because they're just selling you shit.
*  Disasters.
*  They're just selling you disaster.
*  I don't watch it.
*  The TV wasn't allowed in my house until 6, not until 7.
*  And then I don't watch Jeopardy or Game of Fortune.
*  Shit fucks me up because it makes me feel too old.
*  Remember when I'd call for you?
*  I'd call for you at 7.15.
*  Yeah.
*  Who is it?
*  It's Joey.
*  I'm here to call for Joe.
*  Hold on one second.
*  Come in.
*  How you doing Mrs. Rogan?
*  How you doing Joey?
*  Mrs. Rogan, shh, hold on.
*  And she's watching Jeopardy.
*  So when I was a kid, if you watched Jeopardy, you were an old person.
*  So every time Jeopardy comes on now, I get pissed off.
*  I'm like, what the fuck am I doing home?
*  Because when Jeopardy comes on, 7 o'clock, you and I are getting ready to go on stage.
*  That's a good show though.
*  That's a good show.
*  I know it's a good show.
*  I get like one answer per show.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  Yeah, I'm a dumb fuck.
*  But what I'm saying to you is for the last 30 years, you and I, at 7 o'clock, a certain
*  adrenaline goes into our body.
*  And Red Band included.
*  You mean get ready to perform.
*  Get ready to perform.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  At 7 o'clock, something would happen to me that it would change.
*  I'd go from being a dad, husband, all that shit.
*  To being a murderer.
*  I'm going down to the comedy store.
*  I gotta go sharpen the sword.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  7 o'clock, you start thinking about new things.
*  You know, the toilet paper, fucking, you know, all this shit.
*  You write it down.
*  You take a shower.
*  I'd have my process.
*  I'd do a four shot espresso.
*  I'd do two bong hits.
*  I'd take a shower, get all dooted up, get in the fucking car, go over Laurel Canyon.
*  I'd be behind him sometimes.
*  Or a shop, going down Laurel Canyon.
*  Fucking tremendous.
*  And all of a sudden, that got taken away.
*  You don't think we're suffering?
*  We're just, we're learning to deal with it.
*  Well, we got it taken away in the nicest time ever for comedy.
*  This is a thing, like, people that don't, that didn't go to the comedy store, that weren't
*  comedy store regulars, there's an image of the comedy store that I think is from the
*  darker days, where people thought of the comedy stores, that the comics are mean and shitty
*  to each other, and that it's like the industry never goes there.
*  It's like a dark place, like a dangerous place.
*  But when we got shut down in March, that, those last few years were probably the nicest,
*  friendliest years in the history of the store.
*  People were so nice to each other.
*  There were so many people that were supporting each other.
*  And because everybody had podcasts, like, everybody kind of fed off of each other doing
*  that.
*  And so it was beneficial to everybody to pump you up, like to let you, like, you let
*  me know about Jeremiah, you let me know about Tony Hinchcliffe, we let each other know about
*  these guys.
*  And everybody sort of circulates and everybody does well together.
*  It was a real good environment, man.
*  It felt good every time we'd go there.
*  It was all hugs and everybody was laughing.
*  Everybody was like, I love that new tag or this or that.
*  It's fun.
*  It was a good time.
*  It was one of the most positive places I've ever been to in terms of, like, a community
*  for comedians.
*  It was super supportive.
*  And it was like that for years, man.
*  For the first year I was back, I was like, I can't believe I'm back.
*  First show I did back was yours.
*  Yeah, that was fun.
*  And I think Doug Stanhope opened it up.
*  Remember, he was just like, guys, crazy show here.
*  I feel my whole time at the Comedy Store, which is 23 years, was pretty fucking good.
*  You know, I didn't come out here to do anything.
*  I came out here.
*  I was a criminal in Comedy One.
*  I used to be a criminal in a comic and Comedy One beat it.
*  Yeah, but I always knew, Joey, your thing was always that you would come from a very
*  unsteady base.
*  And you could tell.
*  You were like a loving guy, but you had to get to know you.
*  You had to get through you.
*  And then you were a really loving guy.
*  But there was just like the bridge you had to cross.
*  But I knew a lot of people like you.
*  I knew people like you.
*  But I knew people that were brilliant but crazy in the same sort of a way.
*  And it was always the same thing.
*  There's always like their childhood was all fucked up.
*  Or there was a missing there.
*  There's some shit that goes wrong there.
*  And when you develop like that, when you grow like that in such a chaotic experience like
*  yours, it's hard.
*  It's harder.
*  But when you get through, you get through with gifts.
*  That's what's interesting about it.
*  It's harder for you than a person that had like your normal Norman Rockwell mom and pop
*  sort of a life.
*  It's harder for someone like you.
*  It's much more emotionally difficult.
*  You go through much more want for love.
*  You don't feel support.
*  You don't feel stable.
*  And you grow up like that.
*  And it's very hard to right yourself as an adult.
*  Because all of us come out of our childhood, which we don't really have any control over,
*  who our parents are.
*  And we have very little control over our experiences when we're kids.
*  But we come out of that shit shaking.
*  Like when we get onto the road finally, like not everybody comes onto that road with the
*  same amount of stability.
*  Like some people come on that road and like, my mom is awesome.
*  My dad, my mom love each other.
*  Yay.
*  And they're just going down the road.
*  And other people like, who am I?
*  My uncle fucked me.
*  And I'm Don Koch.
*  And I'm only 15.
*  And that there's a lot of those people out there too.
*  It's like a matter of like writing it, a matter of like getting it stable, a matter of like
*  getting your life in a position where you feel like you can make good decisions and
*  you're in control of it.
*  And it's not the same for everybody.
*  And I knew when I met you, you were a good guy.
*  I knew you were a good man.
*  No, I knew that too.
*  I knew right away.
*  I didn't question that.
*  But I knew you just-
*  I just questioned how long I was going to last here.
*  You were distracting yourself with other shit.
*  I didn't know how long I would last here.
*  I thought this was just going to be a fluke and I would end up in New York selling coke.
*  And the story is that I became a regular.
*  I broke the record.
*  I became a regular within a month.
*  Did you really?
*  Yeah, I landed here January 29th.
*  That's amazing.
*  I became a regular February 19th on my 30-something birthday.
*  Well, if Mitzi caught you at the right time-
*  She caught me at the right time.
*  And everybody kept saying to me, has Mitzi seen you?
*  That's amazing.
*  Has Mitzi seen you?
*  So I didn't really go through the whole thing.
*  So now let's go back to that area.
*  That area, that era was hard at the store.
*  I had to follow Mooney every night and Dave Tyree and a bunch of crazy people after 11.
*  It got crazy in there.
*  And then Holtzman would go on and clean the house.
*  And it was just a different- I saw the three different phases of the store.
*  Then we saw the other phase with that fucking mutt, Larrange and his little crew.
*  And I didn't go there for seven years.
*  And then came the Adam fucking era, which was pretty fucking goddamn special.
*  Pretty special.
*  It got overly special.
*  Like, Tuesday nights were fucking just- like you had to go down there prepared for war.
*  Like, Tuesday nights, when you ever see like Rambo before he's going to go somewhere or
*  the Expendables, they always see him sharpening knives and setting all their equipment up
*  and shit like before they go to war, Bradley Cooper and the Sniper.
*  That's how we were on Tuesday nights.
*  Like, we had to sharpen our fucking knives.
*  You had to take your alpha brain.
*  You didn't get high all day.
*  Like, you know, Tuesdays you had to go down there and bring it, bitch.
*  Yeah, you had to jump rope.
*  It was pretty fucking interesting.
*  And it became- but then on the other side of that, it started becoming monotonous for me.
*  It was like, I was on the road or I was at the comedy store.
*  I was on the road or I was at the comedy store.
*  I was at home.
*  I didn't do anything else for like three or four fucking years.
*  Am I mad at that?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I wish I would have gone to more parties maybe.
*  Maybe more concerts.
*  I wish I would have done some more stuff.
*  When I went to New York last year to shoot the Sopranos, I saw my friends and I saw how
*  they live now and who they were now.
*  And we met every night.
*  We went to a different- a great restaurant for dinner.
*  And at a quarter to nine, they'd be yawning.
*  And I'd be happy as fuck that they were yawning because I'm just as fucking tired.
*  We're not kids no more.
*  And we would go our separate ways and I'd go back to my hotel and I'd go, that was
*  tremendous.
*  And that's what you do now.
*  But I went out every night with a different one to a different restaurant.
*  And everybody has families.
*  You know, it just became something different for me.
*  I wanted to go somewhere else.
*  I would go to Texas with you and I'd be, you know me, dog, I'd love you to death.
*  But I want to go home.
*  I want to eat this.
*  I want to go to somebody's house and have the feast of the seven fishes.
*  Okay?
*  I'm sick and tired of eating this shit for the last- I've been gone for 30 years, kid.
*  I've been gone since 83.
*  I went back for 18 months of homelessness and then nine months in 93 to become a comic,
*  to do open mics with Mike Bichetti at the New York Comedy Club across the street from
*  where Costellano got shot.
*  I played the game, dog.
*  Then I went back to Colorado and gotten to fucking, you know, with the X and the ba-ba-bop
*  and the fucking smack and the guy and then getting thrown out.
*  I ended up in Seattle and then two years there and then Stan Hope lured me down here.
*  Then I got a developmental deal.
*  How'd Stan Hope lure you down here?
*  I did New Year's with him.
*  Where at?
*  In Seattle, 96 to 97.
*  He's like, you're wasting your time up here.
*  He goes, you're ready.
*  But I had worked with him like the time before that.
*  So he's like, I got bunk beds, you're wasting your time.
*  And I go, you know what?
*  I gotta go down there and shoot a pilot anyway.
*  CBS is paying me like 20 grand.
*  How'd they find you?
*  Thanksgiving, the night before Thanksgiving in Seattle.
*  What were you doing?
*  I was on stage at the underground.
*  And someone from CBS wanted you to do something?
*  He was from Seattle and he went home for the holidays.
*  And I got off stage and the guy's like, listen, I've been looking for a guy like you for three weeks.
*  Can you read?
*  Yeah.
*  Meet me tomorrow.
*  I'm gonna put you on tape.
*  I got a pilot because we want you to be.
*  It was really fucked up.
*  They wanted my character to be Spanish, but they didn't want him to look Spanish.
*  It was CBS's answer to NYPD Blue.
*  It was a show called Bronx something, something.
*  And I came down and I was the worst actor in the world.
*  I started out with like 19 pages.
*  All the cops and DAs would come into the bar and I would chit chat, give them information.
*  Sell shit.
*  And every day that I went and rehearsed, every day they took a page out.
*  Every day they took a page out.
*  I went down there.
*  By the time they shot the pilot, I had no lines.
*  I just nodded.
*  I was terrible.
*  I was snorting coke.
*  I'd never been to an acting class before.
*  I was staying up till six in the morning, going there at eight.
*  What's his name was the director.
*  Who's What's his name?
*  The guy who played the doctor.
*  You got to think about this one because he's big time.
*  He played a doctor in the movie with Tom Cruise with the naked women.
*  When the she got the chick has a heart attack.
*  He's fucking a young chick.
*  And Tom Cruise has to help him with the chick because the chick is dead.
*  He's a big time motherfucker.
*  And then he played the movies.
*  What's that fucking movie?
*  God damn it.
*  Vanilla Sky.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  What's the movie?
*  I never saw Vanilla Sky.
*  What's the movie with Tom Cruise where he sneaks into the party and there are a bunch of freaks?
*  He's married to the fucking Australian chick at the time.
*  Nicole Kidman.
*  Nicole Kidman and him and Nicole Kidman have a fight.
*  Eyes wide shut.
*  Eyes wide shut.
*  Who played the doctor?
*  That's a Kubrick one.
*  That's a brilliant movie.
*  But whoever played the doctor that he has the girl all coked up.
*  All right.
*  He also played the doctor.
*  You ready?
*  To Johnny Sack in The Sopranos.
*  Really?
*  He was the one that kept saying I shot my wife, the mailman, and I was already going
*  down so I shot the maid too.
*  He was the doctor and he turns his shades and he goes, he tells him Dr. Friedman.
*  That guy.
*  That guy.
*  He directed me in this.
*  And he loved me in the beginning and at the end he wouldn't even look at me.
*  He would just shake his head.
*  I didn't know how to fucking act.
*  It's hard.
*  How can you put me on CBS?
*  I just came.
*  I've been in the new comedy six years.
*  Some people can just fucking do it.
*  Then I got it.
*  No, then I got it doing it more.
*  But that was the first time that they say action and I go what?
*  It's crazy when like an athlete does it.
*  When you're an athlete and then they're really good.
*  You're like Jesus Christ.
*  Like how hard is it to act?
*  This guy just came off the fucking bench.
*  Like there's a lot of athletes have done like, who else has done like amazing jobs?
*  The athlete thing is weird, right?
*  Because at least comedians.
*  Cream adult Jabbar.
*  Fucking rappers really stole the game.
*  Queen Latifah, Ice Cube, Ice Cube, Rope fucking Friday.
*  Right.
*  They're the best example.
*  Are you fucking crazy?
*  Actors are the best example.
*  Or excuse me, rappers.
*  Rappers are the best example.
*  No acting classes, no nothing.
*  They just took it by the horns.
*  They know how to act.
*  No one's better than them.
*  Tupac.
*  Stop and think about it.
*  Like think about how many rappers, high level rappers became high level actors.
*  Bro, Tupac made some weird movies, Joe.
*  He made them, huh?
*  Juice.
*  Which one's juice?
*  Wasn't he in Juice?
*  I think so, yeah.
*  Juice?
*  What about the one where he played the junkie with the guy and the hot black chick?
*  How crazy is that that Tupac was a huge movie star as well as a huge rap star at the same
*  time?
*  I loved him.
*  Poetic Justice.
*  Oh, he was tremendous in Poetic Justice.
*  Dude, he did a lot of movies.
*  He coerced you, Janet Jackson.
*  Did you ever see Bullet with Mickey Rourke?
*  Yes.
*  That was one of the most ridiculous movies of all time.
*  Terrible, terrible, terrible.
*  It was interesting to see the two of them together.
*  Mickey Rourke was jacked.
*  Did you ever see how big Mickey Rourke was in that movie?
*  Go to that movie.
*  There's videos of it.
*  Like Mickey Rourke in a tank top.
*  He was fucking jacked.
*  And the guy next to him with the white shirt, that guy was married to Tracy Lourdes.
*  You know him.
*  That's your buddy, Joe.
*  That's your buddy, Joe.
*  You knew that picture.
*  Yes, you were with him when Manchester star.
*  He was married to Tracy Lourdes.
*  I might have said hi to him.
*  You were playing the drums and jumping up and down with him.
*  Talking about vitamin supplements.
*  What's his fucking name?
*  I don't know the guy.
*  Joe, don't lie to me.
*  He was talking to you about Buck.
*  No, I'm not lying to you.
*  Look right there.
*  Where?
*  That guy was one of the best looking men that ever fucking was in that movie with Mickey
*  Rourke.
*  It says Sam.
*  He's fucking, he's his brother.
*  He's a photographer.
*  Oh.
*  And he's fucking two chicks in a disco.
*  He's, I saw that guy.
*  Who is he?
*  That guy walking the dog.
*  Find out what his name is.
*  Jamie, please sir.
*  What?
*  That's Mickey Rourke.
*  No, that's not Mickey Rourke.
*  The other guy he's holding hands with.
*  Go down with.
*  The guy he's holding hands with.
*  Go down with.
*  Down with.
*  You should show it with I go here.
*  That's no Armando Sante.
*  That guy.
*  That's Sante.
*  It's not showing his name.
*  I don't know.
*  I'll find it.
*  Okay.
*  He came to the store.
*  That's a bold move.
*  Look at the half crop shirt.
*  He played Mickey Rourke's brother in this movie.
*  And the other thing was that he was married to Tracy Lourdes.
*  John Enos.
*  That good looking motherfucker.
*  Well he ain't that good looking no more.
*  But in this movie you would suck his dick.
*  Back in 96.
*  Yeah, he was fucking smoking.
*  He was very, very good looking.
*  This is a strange movie.
*  Dangerous.
*  Very strange movie.
*  Is that that guy Ben the guy who's driving the car?
*  He won an Academy Award years later.
*  It's Adrian Brody?
*  Oh that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Everything was going good.
*  They gave me a 7-Up commercial.
*  And they told me to get the fuck out of here.
*  How do you win an Academy Award and do like a Shasta commercial?
*  Is that what happened?
*  Something weird happened.
*  They shut him down after he did a Shasta commercial?
*  They did something.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just joking.
*  I don't know man.
*  You got another blunt for your uncle?
*  Yes of course I do.
*  Thank you brother.
*  You can have some of mine.
*  No I'm all right.
*  That Corona test was tremendous.
*  I got one right here Jimmy.
*  Just that swab in your nose.
*  I know she took things out of my nose that would need to go.
*  We have to find out what's keeping you going.
*  Make sure everything's okay.
*  I did the antibodies test but then a dentist told me, she goes Joey the antibodies is no
*  good.
*  The FDA approved one is good.
*  It shows you whether or not you've had it.
*  It's a respiratory illness.
*  It shouldn't be in your blood.
*  So that's why she said that's why I did the swab to be honest with you.
*  I didn't want to faint.
*  I fainted the weirdest moments.
*  But that's not real.
*  Whatever she just said that's not true.
*  It's in your blood for sure.
*  Everybody's fouchy now.
*  Who gives a fuck?
*  The best way to find out right in front of you.
*  The best way to find out apparently is you draw blood and then they do an analysis of
*  the blood but the pinprick is FDA approved and the swab lets you know if you have like
*  recent infections.
*  And I got to tell you right here because you know I'm a man's man.
*  I know you're a man's man.
*  I tell you the truth all the time.
*  I've made jokes about Dana White's Fire Island.
*  I want to apologize to him because look he did it right.
*  The bubble worked.
*  Yeah.
*  Now he looks like a hero.
*  The bubble worked.
*  And unless everybody adheres to the bubble then it's not going to work for him.
*  Film crews are figuring it out now too.
*  You haven't heard from Tyler Perry any complaints.
*  But you don't check your fucking junk email.
*  I do lately because I get all the sag emails.
*  And I got to tell you something.
*  You got to read this sag shit.
*  Like what they have to do?
*  Yeah.
*  That's why a lot of them and they're trying to do it fucking you know men's are more and
*  people are showing up going this ain't going to work.
*  Yeah.
*  This ain't going to work.
*  Tyler Perry already put you in a bubble.
*  He picks you up at Van Nuys.
*  You get hired.
*  You go do a test.
*  Sixteen days from when they pick you up in Van Nuys.
*  Then you go to Van Nuys airport.
*  They give you another test.
*  You get on a personal plane.
*  You fly to Atlanta when you get off the plane.
*  They do it again.
*  Quarantine for 24 hours.
*  And then you put into three groups.
*  Group A, Group C, Group B. You can't mingle with B or C. And you got access to a mall,
*  a hotel, a work out, a little area outside.
*  Everybody's social distancing.
*  Not one fucking complaint.
*  But everybody's doing it.
*  When I found this out I got pissed off.
*  This is my life.
*  I've been paying dues.
*  Just like you.
*  I don't want to do movies.
*  And I don't want to do TV.
*  But I got to finish this movie.
*  I thought that I read something in the LA Times that said that by adding COVID to movies
*  it's going to add a million dollars to the budget.
*  Like it's going to cost a million dollars to do it properly.
*  Jesus.
*  Which is.
*  Can't cough on Brian.
*  I didn't cough on Brian.
*  I coughed on my fucking hand.
*  I have a courtesy hat.
*  So for you to shoot a real movie like that you have to have two nurses doing COVID tests.
*  Yeah.
*  They're going to get better.
*  They got to be at the White House.
*  It takes 20 minutes.
*  You know what they're doing?
*  What?
*  They're hiring fucking out of work actors to get certified online.
*  Then they put them on the set to do a COVID test and fucking separate it.
*  Can't do that.
*  I pay dues.
*  I want to fucking nurse that bitch.
*  You know?
*  Well it's the problem is if you catch it and you are not healthy.
*  You don't have a good immune system.
*  You're older.
*  You're compromised.
*  Maybe you got some sort of a condition already.
*  It's not good.
*  So asking people to work where there's a one out of 10 chance or one out of 20 chance or
*  whatever the number is that you might catch it.
*  That's a new ask.
*  That never was the question.
*  The question was, hey, do you want to work at UPS?
*  I'm like, how much does it pay?
*  What are the hours?
*  Okay, I'll do it.
*  It wasn't like you might die.
*  You might catch this disease that you die from.
*  It's not likely, but everyone knows someone who at least knows someone who died from it.
*  So it's like, fuck, how bad do I want this job?
*  Or you could stay home and take 600 bucks from the government or whatever it is.
*  Most people are going to take that money.
*  You're going to downsize your life and just figure out a way to save money.
*  If you worked at a supermarket, it used to be you just worked at a supermarket.
*  It didn't used to be you come in contact with someone that might have something that can
*  kill you and it's killing people.
*  Not a lot.
*  Not a lot, but that does not give you any comfort when you're lying there with tubes
*  in your nose.
*  If you're one of those people that gets it and gets it real bad, like Michael Yeo, and
*  and you think you might be going.
*  Michael Yeo, Jeffrey Guerrero, Frankie Big Balls, and Chris were sitting in the green
*  room together that Friday night.
*  They all got it.
*  Except Chris.
*  He didn't get it?
*  No.
*  Really?
*  Jeffrey got it, hospitalized, Big Ball, Pete, Lisa Linnelli's ex, great guy, he got it.
*  I think he was hospitalized.
*  And as his last blog I read from him, he was on oxygen treatment.
*  Jesus.
*  And Michael Yeo got it.
*  Michael Yeo was here months later and he said he was still struggling with fatigue.
*  So he looked great.
*  When I saw him, like if you saw him you would think, oh he's 100% recovered, like he looked
*  like he was ready to go do a triathlon.
*  But he said no.
*  He said he still gets tired easy.
*  He doesn't feel the same.
*  That's the fucked up shit.
*  Yeah.
*  This is weird.
*  So like, I get it man.
*  I get people not wanting to work.
*  I fucking get it.
*  I'm not saying people should go back to work.
*  I'm saying people should have the option.
*  And I know everybody man, everybody should have the option.
*  Everybody should have the option.
*  This is not a normal time.
*  This is not a normal scene.
*  So if you don't want to work, how much does the government have to give you a week?
*  It's a good question.
*  This should be an honest discussion.
*  We should figure out how much money is necessary.
*  Because your rent get paid.
*  Yeah, that's the rent thing.
*  That's the rent thing.
*  I want to know.
*  It's crazy.
*  You can't just have people broke like this for five months and not even let them work.
*  This is what we're seeing.
*  We're seeing people that are, everyone has a hair trigger.
*  Everybody's ready to go off.
*  That's not good for any of us.
*  No.
*  It's not a smart way to do it.
*  And you look at the restaurants and the restaurants are open.
*  You and I try to support restaurants fucking tacos 86.
*  Three, four times a day.
*  Oh yeah, tacos 90.
*  Four times a day.
*  Oh my god.
*  Brian's like, I've used my body just to support them.
*  No, tacos 1986.
*  Oh my god, Joe Rogan.
*  Just opened up in Burbank.
*  It's amazing.
*  That's our shit.
*  That's our shit.
*  Listen, I love restaurants.
*  I try to support the local restaurants, but I know they're making ugots.
*  They're not making much.
*  They're making dick.
*  They're keeping the employees open.
*  That's why I tip as much as I can.
*  Jamie just handed me, Biden announced Harris for VP.
*  Kamala Harris.
*  The fearless fighter for the little guy.
*  I'm the country's finest public servant as my running mate.
*  They might win.
*  She's a powerful lady.
*  Can you click on her name?
*  She's very good at talking.
*  Yeah, she was that lady that she got into it with Tulsi Gabbard at the primaries.
*  I don't know about these people, Joe Rogan.
*  I know that Biden is old.
*  One of them might be the vice president of the United States.
*  I think that fucking Trump won the election on Saturday when he gave people money because
*  money talks and bullshit walks.
*  If I get a check in the mail from Trump at the 600, he bought my vote right now.
*  The thing about it is, though, I think it relies on the state paying 25%.
*  And the state of California is bankrupt.
*  What did you talk about the other day, 50%?
*  You had me all scared to death.
*  Will you add up the state income tax with the federal income tax?
*  It's in the neighborhood of 54%.
*  That's where it's going to go up to?
*  Yes, the increase that California wants to do.
*  Look, they're trying to figure out a way to buy the way out of some of the problems that
*  we have.
*  I get it.
*  I don't know what the fuck they should do.
*  I'm a moron.
*  I shouldn't be the mayor or the governor.
*  I am not going to do it.
*  It's not in my wheelhouse.
*  I would not balance the budget.
*  I'm not a pay attentioner.
*  That's not me, man.
*  I've got things to do.
*  I'm worried about space.
*  I'm not worried about your budget.
*  But somebody has to do it and they have to do it right.
*  They need a fucking real plan.
*  No one is telling us how to get out of this economically.
*  No one is telling us how to get out of this health-wise.
*  Everybody is bitching.
*  But this is the first time we've been caught with our pants down.
*  I'm not mad at anybody.
*  I can't really be mad at anybody because everybody got caught with their pants down.
*  How we've handled it at times is kind of weird.
*  It's not just that.
*  It's not just that.
*  We look vulnerable as a nation.
*  Because we handled it stupid.
*  We had a big giant surge again.
*  It's like we were doing real well.
*  Everything was trending down.
*  Then we have a big giant surge again.
*  Now people are going out.
*  Now places that weren't getting it are getting it again.
*  We didn't do such a good job.
*  The problem is if the country is locked up, and we basically are a big percentage of everybody's
*  locked down and we're economically fucked and we're scared to do things.
*  We're probably not that healthy.
*  We're not as healthy as we normally are.
*  And there's not as much money and people aren't working well.
*  This is not a strong country then.
*  The country is only strong if everything is strong.
*  The economy is strong.
*  The military is strong.
*  The government is strong.
*  When the economy is fucked and the people are unhealthy, that's the backbone of the
*  whole country.
*  This is a vulnerable country.
*  That's where it gets weird.
*  We don't ever want to think that.
*  We're like, oh, we don't have to worry about that anymore.
*  But of course we do.
*  That's history.
*  History is countries taking over countries.
*  History is countries figuring out a way to dominate other countries.
*  Who knows what they're doing today to each other?
*  We hear about Russian interference.
*  Who knows what kind of fucking viruses we have on our computers?
*  Oh, that mail-in fucking thing is going to be a party in a half.
*  That is the biggest scam in the fucking world.
*  That is the biggest fucking scam in the world.
*  Already the post office is running fucking blind.
*  Never mind all those ballots.
*  That's a scam in a half.
*  That's a scam in a half and it's terrible.
*  I wonder what the best way to do it is though.
*  What if it turns out the post office is the best way to do it?
*  Maybe it takes more time but maybe they're better at it.
*  Oh, bro, you never stuff boxes for $20 and look the other way?
*  No, I never stuff boxes for $20.
*  I have stuffed boxes.
*  I grew up in North Bergen, New Jersey.
*  Stuff boxes.
*  What do you mean by stuffed boxes?
*  I grew up in North Bergen, New Jersey.
*  I was a Cuban kid that stumbled upon a fight one day and stuck up for an Italian kid and
*  they made me part of their family.
*  But the other part of their family was that they were political.
*  And he was the other side of the wing for politics.
*  Remember, there's a mayor and he shows up with a guy like you that's intelligent but
*  then he also has a guy like me.
*  And I do weird things for him.
*  I let people know what the mayor wants done.
*  And I got to be very, I was that guy's son.
*  I was his son.
*  I became his son.
*  And then his son died and I really became his son.
*  So I didn't know what I was doing.
*  He would just go, go light this on fire.
*  Put $50 in your pocket and that's all I went and did.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  He told me to go pick up this.
*  I went and picked this up.
*  He told me to go do this.
*  I still remember how I met most of my friends today were from that election.
*  The 76 election, column A and column B. And I mean, they were battling on the street.
*  I don't tell you about Jersey knuckleheads.
*  You know, we're throwing rocks at each other.
*  And then at night we were paid to go rip down your signs.
*  And then the next night your people rip down our signs.
*  And then whoever puts a sign of each one on, we all have a fucking memory of that.
*  So if I side with Joe Rogan in North Bergen and Joe Rogan loses, I'm always going to
*  pack my bags because they're going to demote me from a teacher to a janitor.
*  That's how they get you in Jersey, dog.
*  So they would all put signs on their lawn for the guy that they support.
*  Let everybody know.
*  This is the way you...
*  Listen.
*  You're my friend?
*  They tell you.
*  Spalding.
*  You vote for Harry Spalding.
*  He's a good man.
*  They come to your house, they knock on your door and they tell you who you're going to
*  vote for.
*  Listen, you're going to vote for these guys.
*  It's going to be fine.
*  We'll take care of you.
*  Your brother-in-law needs a job to retard, right?
*  Sounds like a nightmare place to live, by the way.
*  I would hate this.
*  You think?
*  What are you doing?
*  I'm going to move my board to get away from me.
*  Joey, you're moving back to this?
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  That's Hudson County politics.
*  That's how it used...
*  Listen, in Hudson County, Jamie, if you'd like to verify, no mayor in Hudson County
*  has ever just vacated.
*  They've all either been put in prison or died.
*  Every mayor.
*  The active mayor in North Bergen now is very good.
*  He has changed the town.
*  His name is Mayor Sacco.
*  He's very good.
*  Very good.
*  That town is clean, Bobby.
*  Camera's everywhere.
*  You do something.
*  There's a curfew at night.
*  Very clean.
*  In fact, they just had a write-up about the New York Times where most of the people are
*  moving to.
*  It's my hometown, North Bergen, and down the hill, Edgewater.
*  You know who lives in Edgewater?
*  Isn't that Frankie Edgar?
*  No.
*  He's in Tom's River, right?
*  He's in Tom's River.
*  You know who lives in Edgewater?
*  Who?
*  Name a rapper.
*  Jay-Z?
*  Name a rapper.
*  He lives there?
*  Ice-T.
*  Really?
*  Naughty by nature.
*  Ice-T does that.
*  All the Knicks.
*  All the Knicks.
*  All the baseball players live in Edgewater.
*  So, it's right above Edgewater.
*  All that Hudson County hoboken where G knows a cop and all that, that's Hudson County.
*  They play by their own rules, G.
*  They do it a different way.
*  You've got to pick a side.
*  You've got to pick a side.
*  If you don't pick a side and that side loses, boom.
*  You've got to live in that hometown to work in that hometown.
*  Oh, no.
*  They fuck with you.
*  It's a whole...
*  You went with the wrong side.
*  But it's tremendous.
*  It's a way to keep everybody in line.
*  Everybody knows where they stand.
*  Once you go, you go.
*  Those guys that put their hand on the back of your neck, those guys that tell you, this
*  is what we're going to do.
*  We're going to do this, okay?
*  They're holding the back of your neck.
*  You're like, what kind of conversation is this?
*  You're not squeezing my neck yet, but it seems like, what happens if I don't vote for this
*  guy?
*  There's interesting ones that you've never watched, but you should read about.
*  I think Jamie has watched.
*  It's season two of Narcos when they rigged the election in Mexico.
*  And they try to do it with the computer and they get busted.
*  And then they actually just sent Narcos to the fucking voting stations.
*  They put a gun to your head and go, put another zero next to that number.
*  Whoa.
*  In 1987, the elections in Mexico were so fucking crooked because the government that was coming
*  in was going to side with the United States and that could never happen.
*  They were going to lose millions of dollars.
*  So that government had a win.
*  And when you watch it play out in the series, you're like, but when you read about it, you're
*  like, what the fuck?
*  They caught him red handed.
*  It's like you catching me taking this and you going, Joey, that's mine.
*  Yeah.
*  And walking out here.
*  Like it was that cold blooded of an election.
*  The fucking guy had to resign years later, but it was that brutal because they figured
*  they weren't going to win the election in Mexico City.
*  So they went to all these farmer places and all those motherfuckers got beat up.
*  So forget about Mexico City.
*  We're going to lose Mexico City.
*  It was what's the name of the PRA?
*  The PRA is an organization, tremendous storyline on how they needed that government to win
*  so they could keep getting drugs into this country and how the CIA was even involved
*  in that election.
*  But it was the narcos who went out to the small villages and fucking put guns to your
*  head.
*  Put a zero on that number.
*  It is one of the craziest things about being an American is that we're connected to a
*  country that's feeding us drugs and is run by cartels.
*  And everybody's like, shh.
*  Well, they had a town in Mexico during this that the cartel said if they saw you on the
*  streets without a face mask, they'd shoot you.
*  They've done that in other countries.
*  It was such a small village that it would have destroyed the village.
*  So the narcos got involved and said, if you go out without a face mask, we'll put a bullet
*  in your head.
*  There's something about people who have power, whether it's you're the mayor or the governor
*  or you're the narcos or you're a cop, something about people having that kind of power over
*  your life right that with just a finger on a trigger.
*  It's too much for most people to handle.
*  It's too much.
*  Most people can't handle it.
*  That's what you're seeing.
*  Most people should not have the ability to just shoot you.
*  You can't shoot them, but they can shoot you.
*  You don't listen.
*  They could shoot you if you're running away.
*  They could shoot you.
*  You come with them with a taser.
*  They could shoot you.
*  They need to like make a freeze gun where you could just freeze them.
*  That's not a bad idea.
*  To a world that nobody could call a cop's life until you're a fucking cop.
*  It's too hard to understand what that job's like.
*  It's too hard to understand in tales.
*  You know why I started going to Jiu-Jitsu?
*  So I could watch the UFC's and not feel guilty.
*  Because I can't, nothing bothers me more when I see a blogger or an announcer that's never done the jumping jack.
*  And he's trying to cover the UFC.
*  Nothing bothers me more than that.
*  So I want you to understand.
*  I grew up with guys that were cops.
*  I talked to them.
*  I saw how they had to blow steam off because of the things they saw.
*  Yeah, they used their power.
*  They fucked around.
*  They were all bad lieutenants if you want to call it.
*  But the job itself, unless you're doing it, man, it's weird.
*  It's so weird.
*  It's a weird job.
*  You live in a different world than everybody else.
*  Do I appreciate police?
*  Listen, I've been arrested.
*  How many times have I been arrested?
*  A million.
*  I never had a fucking...
*  You've been arrested a million times.
*  A million point one.
*  I never had a problem with a cop.
*  I even had a cop pull over to a Chinese restaurant one time and let me get food handcuffed.
*  Because I had meat and all that.
*  But you got good cops and you're a good guy.
*  That's number three.
*  You charmed them.
*  I've never said the word pig on any podcast.
*  When I went to jail, I went to jail on my own accord.
*  It was my problem.
*  I've never given a cop a problem.
*  When they interrogated me, oh, I'll light you on fire.
*  If you want to get interrogated, you interrogate me.
*  I'll talk to you about the Cuban Missile Crisis.
*  I'll get you.
*  Baby pigs.
*  Those two white dudes in Boulder, I had them confused to death.
*  I had them confused to death.
*  I was taking them on psychological rides.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  The one cop I faced on Facebook and started torturing him.
*  I want to see some dumb dude try to interrogate you.
*  He lives in Telluride and he was involved in the John Benet-Ramsey case.
*  So when I mentioned his name on a podcast one time, people started sending me messages.
*  They go, you know, we go to school with this kid.
*  This kid's a fucking moron.
*  They feel like this kid became a criminal, but the dad has gotten him out of trouble all his life.
*  The kid's a fucking criminal.
*  So they told the same people from Facebook hit me when they go, your buddy, the cop, retired.
*  So I sent them an email.
*  Hey, on Facebook, hey, listen, congratulations on your retirement.
*  Check out Joey Diaz on YouTube, cuck sucker.
*  And I know you read it, but he didn't fucking reply.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  That's hilarious.
*  I put him, dog, listen to what I did to that dude.
*  Just, there was two of them.
*  All right.
*  There was a big white dude that, the white dude, this is the fucking crazy thing.
*  I was not wanted, but I was questioned on the credit card situation.
*  In August of 85, somebody had destroyed that mall with a credit card.
*  And somebody said I fit the description.
*  So these two cops with uniforms kept asking me questions.
*  I worked at Foot Locker and they keep showing up every day.
*  Can we talk to you?
*  Yeah, the jewelry store said, it's you.
*  Listen, pretty soon, you know, they didn't have cameras then, Joe.
*  So they kept saying, pretty soon we're going to start getting the receipt and you're going to have to go in for whatever.
*  And they were coming every day and shake me down.
*  And I would go, guys, if I was a fucking credit card thief, would I be working at Foot Locker?
*  So I was just buying time.
*  I knew they were going to catch me eventually.
*  That one cop even came to my house on a Sunday night, knocked on my door and said, we're getting the jean sizes tomorrow.
*  You might as well turn yourself in.
*  I'm like, dog, you got to go on and get the fuck off my doorstep.
*  That night, that morning, I went to San Francisco.
*  A year later, I get arrested for kidnapping.
*  He gets promoted to detective.
*  He doesn't remember me from the credit card thing.
*  The whole time I'm sitting there going, what is this fucking cop going to remember me from the credit card thing?
*  So you got to remember, I turned myself in.
*  When I turned myself in, dog, and I pressed that buzzer and they opened that door, all the cops drew their guns on me and said, get on the floor.
*  Because I was wanted for kidnapping and kidnapping too.
*  They didn't know what I was packing, what type of person I was.
*  So they handcuffed me, put me in a room that was white, made me wait for a half hour.
*  Then they came in and played their technique, which I've been doing to people all my fucking life.
*  You know, I'm the one that would break into Joe Rogan's house and steal one shoe.
*  You would give it to somebody.
*  You take an ounce of coke and you steal one shoe.
*  Oh, that's horrible.
*  And then you steal that one favorite pair of shoes.
*  You take one shoe and you throw it away.
*  That destroys people psychologically.
*  For years, they'll keep looking for that one shoe.
*  What happened?
*  And then every time you see them, you find that shoe.
*  No, I fucking searched everywhere.
*  You're the greatest fuck.
*  Oh yeah, I'm the fucking dirtiest bastard.
*  I know how to fucking flip flop you.
*  So these guys get you in an interrogation room.
*  They get me into the interview room and they ask me what's going on.
*  And I'm talking to them like, I don't know what happened.
*  The guy showed up, the guy pulled the gun.
*  Next thing you know, I was home.
*  And they're like, so what happened to the guy with the machine gun?
*  I don't know.
*  Did you know him?
*  Did you know him?
*  I don't know.
*  You know, so how did you get there?
*  I had a bike.
*  But you just said you drove.
*  Yeah, I drove to get the bike.
*  I was just fucking with them because I wanted to get out.
*  Don Johnson was marrying Sheila Easton on Miami Vice that night.
*  I had to be home by nine.
*  That's all I cared about was his wedding.
*  So I'm fucking with the cops.
*  I'm like, I'm just going to go in there and talk to them, tell them the truth.
*  That yeah, I went over there.
*  They were selling drugs and I left.
*  I had nothing to do.
*  What kidnapping?
*  What are you talking about?
*  So we went back and forth for like six hours.
*  And I still remember them sitting there like with their hands down and me talking about like, you know, my uncle came from Cuba in 1952 and he worked for fucking this guy.
*  And they're like, what's this got to do with what we're talking about?
*  Doug, I tormented them.
*  And then I agreed to give the guy information.
*  And I would just give him like red bands drivers.
*  Hey, that's what I swear to God.
*  I would give him Jamie's license plate.
*  Jamie's not a drug dealer, but I would tell him that Jamie was running kilos internationally from Europe.
*  They would fucking they would go through Jamie's life.
*  Imagine if Jamie was doing that.
*  And then they wouldn't find nothing.
*  So they would figure out the fucking Jamie.
*  I was playing them.
*  I was just giving them fake license plates.
*  How long did you do this for?
*  Six months.
*  They thought they would leave the real business.
*  I'm telling you, he runs a big coke from Colombia.
*  He knows the Ochoa Brothers.
*  No. Yeah.
*  So you were just making up this crazy narrative of yokels.
*  I was tormenting these two cops, but the one cop wasn't going for it.
*  He didn't like me personally.
*  And I let him know that I didn't like him personally.
*  It's a movie.
*  It was a far.
*  I let him know I hated him more than what he hated fucking me.
*  That's what I did.
*  I let him know that I hated more.
*  And every time we went to court, he would sit there across from me.
*  But I had a good attorney and it was burning him up because he wanted me for kidnapping.
*  But I'm like, not dog.
*  You didn't find no fingerprints on nothing.
*  Sorry, Charlie.
*  Not this time.
*  So if he was chomping at the thing, he went to all the hearings and said that, you know, they're like, we don't see nothing else on the record.
*  So if there's nothing else on the record, this is you against him.
*  No, doesn't work that way.
*  He kept saying I was violent.
*  I was going to kill the community.
*  You know, he was one of those white evangelist type guys.
*  He even was so mad at me that he joined forces with my ex wife in court afterward for like child hearings and shit like that.
*  That's how crazy it got.
*  Oh, my God.
*  He was there when I went off one day, Cuban style.
*  And that's the last time I saw him.
*  Cuban style.
*  Ricardo.
*  The last time I went to court, remember the last time I went to court, my wife, it was the same judge that sentenced me.
*  Oh, no.
*  Only he was in civil court now.
*  But here's the beauty.
*  I kept writing them letters every month because that's the type of motherfucker I am.
*  You write them letters?
*  From the minute I got sentenced to jail.
*  What do the letters say?
*  How you doing, Judge Belaponte?
*  My name is Joey Diaz.
*  Thank you for your sentence.
*  I'm starting to learn what it's all about to be a man.
*  For the last 28 years, I've been running amok every month, every month on the 1st.
*  He got a letter from me.
*  When I got out of jail, I doubled up.
*  I got a job as a car salesman.
*  I really enjoy it.
*  Thank you for giving me the opportunity.
*  Did he ever write you back?
*  Never.
*  Wow.
*  Never.
*  But I wrote him letters, wrote him letters, wrote him letters, wrote him letters.
*  I got out of jail February of 89.
*  I wrote him letters.
*  I went in front of him in May of 95.
*  He was a civil judge and I was still writing him letters.
*  I told him I was trying comedy.
*  I was getting divorced.
*  My wife was breaking my balls.
*  We end up in court in front of him.
*  The fucking boyfriend's got a stake over his eye because I smacked him because he called me a spick.
*  So I smacked him in the face a safe way.
*  So they're trying to get me for assault.
*  Oh yeah, tremendous afternoon.
*  What did the judge say?
*  And the judge goes, number one, you got to throw your case out because it's a city limits a boulder.
*  You can't use a racial slur.
*  If you use a racial slur, the city limits a boulder.
*  Someone could just beat your ass?
*  It's called the J.J. Flanagan law.
*  And number two, then he attacked my wife.
*  He was like, listen, you fucking come back in here again with this shit.
*  It's contempt of court.
*  So all those years of writing paid off.
*  All those years.
*  So my wife got mad.
*  The ex got mad.
*  And I'm going to walk out of that was when I did something that to this day I regret.
*  It was that bad.
*  Like how bad I went off.
*  But it was four years of getting tortured.
*  Think of you tortured me for four years.
*  I'm financially done.
*  I'm financially ruined.
*  I'm trying to feature.
*  I'm getting heat because I'm dirty.
*  Oh, I remember those days.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like everything.
*  That's the hard road.
*  So I was featuring in dirty bars, but they would make me emcee at the clubs and they made me work clean and read the announcements and shit.
*  Some comics didn't want you on the show.
*  A lot of comics didn't want me on the show.
*  I wasn't that.
*  No, no, I wasn't throwing heat then.
*  No, I just was doing well.
*  I was holding my own.
*  Even when I met you in the beginning, you were dirty.
*  Yes, yes.
*  But for some people that's like a deal breaker.
*  I went clean for the first three years and it wasn't me.
*  I was trying to be Lenny Clark with a suit.
*  I mimicked Lenny Clark first, but I liked Bill Hicks and I love Richard Pryor.
*  Shout out to my friend Lenny.
*  Lenny had a bit of a medical situation come up.
*  Send him my love.
*  I knew he was on the show.
*  Now, yeah, he's gone through some medical problems.
*  He's a good man.
*  He's a very good man.
*  I met him at the store and I told him exactly how I felt and why I wore a suit the first
*  three years of my career, but it didn't work.
*  Because of him?
*  Because of him.
*  I opened up for him the second time I ever got paid.
*  First time I got paid, Warren MacDonald took me on the road, did a shitty gig in the middle
*  of nowhere.
*  Second time I got paid, I did Jays in Pittsfield opening up for Lenny Clark and I couldn't
*  believe it.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  Lenny Clark, who I saw on TV, and I'm hanging out with him and his brother, and his brother
*  wound up giving me gigs.
*  Mike Clark, still a good friend to this day.
*  That was 31 years ago.
*  Love that guy.
*  How crazy has his journey been?
*  It's crazy.
*  I worked for Mike Clark once in a restaurant where you'd be in the middle of your set and
*  the fucking PA system would take over your microphone.
*  Johnson, party to your tables ready.
*  They would cut you in the middle of your set.
*  I didn't know it until I got on stage.
*  I'm on stage talking to the crowd.
*  It just became the funniest part of the act.
*  It was just making fun of how pathetic my life is.
*  I'm at a fucking fish restaurant down the Cape and in the middle of talking, my bits
*  get cut off by people getting announced at their tables ready.
*  It's like those car shows.
*  People just start honking their horns.
*  Can somebody kick off this?
*  Burt said they don't do that.
*  He said they do that at the end when they're laughing at stuff.
*  There's a lot of amateur open mic versions of them and stuff like that.
*  You've got people just blasting their horn.
*  Mark Norman said it best.
*  Mark Norman's a very smart man.
*  He said it best.
*  He said this is a methadone comedy.
*  He goes, I want my fix, man.
*  He goes, I want the real deal.
*  I don't want this fucking park comedy.
*  He said he bombed in a park and he actually heard crickets.
*  Real crickets.
*  Oh, God.
*  That's hilarious.
*  You know what, Dong?
*  You know what?
*  I worked real fucking hard.
*  My joke gig was I worked on Wednesday nights in an Italian restaurant where the guy was the cook,
*  but he was also an Elvis impersonator.
*  And he had been an Elvis impersonator for 20 years in Vegas.
*  He met Elvis.
*  He was the worst Elvis impersonator.
*  He was Italian.
*  He was 150 pounds overweight.
*  So he would bring you the food and then he would turn into Elvis.
*  I would go up on stage and do ten and then he would go up there and just put Elvis music on and sing over it.
*  That was my 50 year in comedy.
*  I'm like, what am I going to do with my life?
*  Every Wednesday night, that was my ten o'clock gig.
*  It was like 12 people in the restaurant.
*  And he would go up there and sing his own, it's now or never.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And he was fucking terrible.
*  And then I would have to sit throughout the whole show.
*  He would give me spaghetti and meatballs to take home, which I don't have to tell you.
*  At that level, it's like a steak.
*  It's breakfast and lunch the next day.
*  So I had to sit through his whole set.
*  God forbid he did an encore.
*  Every time he did an encore, I would get a heartburn for an hour.
*  Please finish the song.
*  So I went through that shit.
*  You know, that was, I love all those stories.
*  Those stories.
*  Those terrible gigs, they make you better.
*  They make you better.
*  But you can't live on a steady diet of them.
*  It's like, here's the deal.
*  You can't do deadlifts with 500 pounds every day.
*  You'll break your fucking back.
*  You'll tear your knees apart.
*  You'll rip your shoulders apart.
*  But you can do it every now and then.
*  You've got to give your body enough time to recover and actually improve.
*  If you do those fucking terrible hell gigs every single night, it changes your act.
*  You get armored.
*  You lose your ability to take pauses.
*  You lose your ability to set up a point and then really hit it home hard.
*  Like change tempos.
*  You have to keep on them.
*  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
*  Drunk bars, you've got to keep on them.
*  Bang, bang, bang.
*  Which is fine.
*  But you shouldn't do it all the time.
*  No, but I used Uncle Joey Cocodilla's method.
*  Which was, I had an 11.45 at the store, which meant I was really going up at 12 pounds.
*  I was really going up at 12.15.
*  I was a coke junkie.
*  There was no way I was going to hold off till 12.15.
*  Are you doing math?
*  No, I've got to write the plan out so people see that there's a method of my fucking madness.
*  So in those days, Felipe Esparza had a room, Willie Barsena had a room.
*  All those guys had bar rooms.
*  And I knew in those days that I had to prepare two different sets.
*  I had to have my bar set, which was pretty basically dirty.
*  And then you had to go acapella because sometimes you've got to go up during the Laker game.
*  You're not going to turn off a Laker game in Orange County.
*  They loved Joe Rogan, but you ain't going to turn off a Laker game.
*  It's just not going to happen.
*  Or the Bruins back in Boston.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  So you've got to wait for the Laker game to go on.
*  You know how many of those, George Perez, Fly, I still shout those guys out.
*  Rudy Moreno.
*  All those guys had early gigs for us that fed us, gave you 50, 60 bucks.
*  And then you kill time.
*  You stopped at King Taco and then you got to the store at 11.
*  Joe would be at News Radio till 10.30 rehearsing.
*  You would show up late and that's when I first met you, you were still rehearsing.
*  Friday nights, you would shoot on Friday nights.
*  And then you would do this spot on Friday night.
*  And I would go on after you.
*  And you were on at 11.30.
*  That was not 10.45 days yet.
*  You were still getting a quarter to 12.
*  I was very lucky I didn't have a social life.
*  So I could just, you know, I didn't have friends out here.
*  So I would just do the show and then go to the store and then hang out with those guys.
*  I didn't really know anybody yet.
*  So it was good.
*  I got a lot of work done.
*  But the thing about stand-up is what we had at the store that was really unusual was also the people that were there.
*  What was really unusual was also what you were talking about with Tuesday Nights.
*  It was a murderer's row in a way that I've never seen before.
*  Like every night you would go there.
*  It would be Jessalneck, Eliza, DeLeah, you, Nick Swartz.
*  And it was just murderer after murderer after murderer.
*  It really got heavy.
*  Ron Wayne.
*  Oh my God, Ron Wayne would come in and destroy.
*  Ali Wong.
*  Ali Wong.
*  As Nancy Dressler, whatever her fucking stage name was.
*  Ian Edwards, Owen Smith, Tom Segura, Bert Crusher, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
*  Those lineups were fucking death, man.
*  You want to come out guns blazing.
*  And a lot of people got upset at those lineups.
*  They're like, I can't get a spot.
*  I can't get a spot.
*  This is fucked up and they get mad.
*  You know, I feel like these people don't respect me.
*  And there's like this talk, we need more women.
*  There was all this talk.
*  We need more this.
*  We need more that.
*  The bottom line is that was a murderer's row.
*  And it was so hard to find a spot because what are you going to do?
*  You got Santino.
*  You got Ian Edwards.
*  You got all these people back to back to back to back that are just fucking killers, killer
*  after killer.
*  Where's the Spotify lighters?
*  Where's the go away?
*  That's not even a Bic.
*  What is that?
*  This is from Gino.
*  I want a Spotify lighter.
*  This is a Speedweed lighter.
*  I want a Spotify lighter.
*  You probably turned this volume down.
*  Here, hold on.
*  That's dead.
*  What kind of whiskey is that by the way?
*  I mean, that's the closest to tasting a saddle I've ever tasted.
*  This is John.
*  No, those two different whiskeys.
*  This is Buffalo Trace.
*  The first stuff we had that you enjoyed.
*  And there's another stuff which I love is Warbringer, the War Master edition.
*  This is Josh Barnett's personal whiskey.
*  It's for men.
*  That tastes like a man cowboy.
*  How do we have no lighters here?
*  How is that?
*  I'm going to go pee real quick.
*  How is it even possible we don't have lighters in this fucking place?
*  That's crazy.
*  You don't want to use a Zippo either.
*  You don't?
*  No, because you get the fumes from the Zippo juice.
*  I had a lighter.
*  How do we not have lighters?
*  We had some and I gave them to you to hide I think.
*  He's a good hider.
*  Look inside that skull eye.
*  I probably hit him so well I stole them from myself.
*  No, look in the skull eye.
*  Maybe that's the worst.
*  If worse comes to worst I have one in my car somewhere.
*  Maybe go to your car.
*  This is not happening.
*  How crazy is it we got to send Red Band out to his fucking car in order to get a lighter?
*  I think that's the first time you've ever handed me breaking news in the middle of a show.
*  It is very important.
*  Breaking news.
*  I saw it literally within 45 seconds of him tweeting it out.
*  I was like, what do I do here?
*  Maybe you should be a great president.
*  Let's see.
*  Let's just switch positions.
*  People keep telling me, dude, there's nothing wrong with him.
*  He just has a stutter.
*  People keep saying that.
*  Like everybody at 78 is fucked.
*  Everybody.
*  Who's not fucked at 78?
*  Find me a guy.
*  Find me a guy.
*  When I'm 78, don't take any of my advice.
*  I probably won't know what I'm talking about.
*  I'll probably be high as a kite.
*  Oh shit, Brian's got a lighter.
*  When I'm 78, I'll be like Tommy Chong.
*  High as a kite.
*  Talking shit.
*  I love Tommy Chong.
*  I love him too.
*  I've been doing comedy in virtual reality, and now it's the closest to feeling like you're in front of people, I thought.
*  That makes sense.
*  Are you doing it like in Oculus or is it?
*  Valve Index.
*  So it's like the best one.
*  Good refresh rate.
*  Can people record you?
*  Yeah, but I live stream it anyway.
*  But it's cool to test out new jokes because there's like 20 people there and they laugh and they react.
*  They're all like, oh, you know, like Spongebob's excited.
*  Comedy is different with a small amount of people.
*  There's like a there's a good kind of comedy that you can get out of a small amount of people.
*  It's like you get an honest comedy because you can't put on like a stupid show for three people.
*  You have to like be you have to really talk to them.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  It's weird.
*  But you also don't get those big bits.
*  You're not going to develop big bits.
*  Oh, no, it's all tags.
*  It's all tags.
*  It's all like new ideas and stuff like that.
*  Sometimes you have good bits.
*  Sometimes bits come from that, though.
*  It depends really entirely on how fun the people are, the audience member.
*  Anybody says that it doesn't the audience doesn't matter.
*  It's like it's not the audience.
*  It's the comedian.
*  You're fucking crazy.
*  You're crazy.
*  Of course, it's the audience, too.
*  It's a bunch of people together.
*  It's everybody.
*  Like every single interaction between two people, unless somebody comes up from behind you and hits you in the head, involves you and them interacting.
*  There's a bunch of, you know, a lot of pieces in place.
*  If there's a fucking group of people and then you're telling jokes, of course it matters who the audience is.
*  Whoever the fuck said that's an idiot.
*  That doesn't matter.
*  It's not.
*  It's there's no such thing as a bad crowd.
*  Only a bad comedian.
*  Fuck you.
*  You don't know what you're talking about.
*  It's funny.
*  There's that peacock thing.
*  It's an app from NBC.
*  So they have it's free and you get like all these old episodes.
*  And so I've been watching old Johnny Carson episodes and it's weird.
*  The monologue is so interesting.
*  It's like it's like history like, oh, we're going through the gas crisis of 1979 or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  But it's also interesting just to hear them talking about all that stuff like the old days and and like seeing Richard Pryor on with Betty Davis.
*  They're smoking cigarettes while they're playing.
*  It's such an interesting time capsule that is.
*  Yeah, those days, man, the bell bottoms days, bell bottoms and long collars.
*  People are living different then.
*  I remember fucking watching Letterman in 82.
*  That was my thing.
*  When I first got turned on to Letterman, a friend of mine turned me on to Letterman and I thought it was the greatest thing ever.
*  Who's the first comic you saw?
*  Live?
*  Yeah.
*  The first comic I listened to, I can't even fucking say the album cover because I'll get in trouble.
*  I went to my friend's house to listen to the Beatles and his brother was a junkie and he came out of the room.
*  I was about eight, maybe nine, and he came out of the room and he goes, what the fuck kind of music is that shit?
*  The fuck you listening to?
*  Take that shit off.
*  I'm like, it's the Beatles.
*  He's like, fuck the Beatles.
*  And he put on Richard Pryor, the crazy.
*  And my fucking head went off a swivel, Joe Rogan.
*  Like it just completely went off a swivel.
*  I ran home to the bar and I worked my mom for five bucks.
*  And I went to the album store.
*  Albums were $4.99, you know, and I just had to get that album.
*  I went home and played it.
*  I would hide it from my mother because you could put the album down and then put another album on top.
*  That was going to drop.
*  So if your mom came in, you automatically dropped.
*  So she couldn't hear.
*  And then I bought Bicentennial and that put me over the top.
*  Now, there was no dream of me being a comic at this time.
*  I just thought the things he was saying were so fucking me.
*  Like I wanted to be able to talk like that.
*  I'm Cuban.
*  I figured if I talked like that, I could influence motherfuckers and win people over because I had that little insecurity about being an immigrant.
*  But if I spoke like that and I could be that funny, I could.
*  So I just started mimicking them.
*  And I would bring that album to people's houses and the kids would be ten and the mothers would catch us.
*  And still today, there's a kid, Ray Canela, his mother's still mad at me for bringing over Richard Pryor.
*  There were like three mothers that got mad at me.
*  Lucio Fernandez, that's a committee man in Union City.
*  He told me and my wife that we were eating one day.
*  And he goes, let me tell you something about your husband.
*  He fucking turned me on to Richard Pryor when we were ten.
*  I remember getting in trouble because I brought the album over.
*  I was that young already into and then I got into Red Fox and then Lenny Bruce got into it.
*  Then I saw Carlin on HBO and that was tremendous.
*  And then I saw Freddie Prinze and then I was partial to Freddie Prinze.
*  I related to Freddie Prinze because he was Spanish.
*  So that gave me like hope, like kind of, you know, maybe, you know what I'm saying, like Spanish people could do stand up.
*  Then he shot himself.
*  And I remember that night the way, like, I still remember the night that kid killed himself.
*  Like we didn't get the news like you get it now.
*  Like I got the news when we were out that night.
*  He had shot himself the night before or the early morning or whatever.
*  But I still remember him getting shot.
*  What year is this?
*  I was, had to be 74, 75.
*  I was staying with my grandfather in Newark during the Chico and the Man days.
*  Chico and the Man followed Sanford and Son.
*  Exactly.
*  On Friday night at 8 o'clock.
*  My grandfather loved Sanford and Son.
*  During Lent with a white pizza?
*  Are you fucking, you're talking to the fucking, with a white pizza?
*  Sanford and Son?
*  Pull up a picture of Chico and the Man.
*  It was a good fucking show.
*  It was Freddie Prinze.
*  And the old man.
*  He was on top of the world too, man.
*  That was the weird thing.
*  Oh my God.
*  They were posting the Tonight Show.
*  They were grooming him to take over the Tonight Show.
*  When you hear about a guy like that taking his own life, you're like there's no way.
*  And then you and I were driving from Dallas to Houston.
*  We pulled over at a record store and we bought a thing of him live from Chicago.
*  And it was terrible.
*  Yeah, it wasn't good.
*  It was really bad.
*  It was really bad.
*  Well, you know the problem was, Joey, it was baited.
*  1973 comedy.
*  Yeah, it was 1973 comedy.
*  And it's 73 comedy, not Richard Pryor.
*  I mean, there was guys like Richard Pryor that were, to this day, like if you go back and listen to some of Richard Pryor's stuff, it still holds up.
*  It still holds up.
*  And Jose Feliciano sang the tank.
*  Yes!
*  Oh my God.
*  Chico, Donald P. and the Man, whatever the fuck it is.
*  I don't remember how it goes, but I remember it.
*  Oh man.
*  I liked that show.
*  It just made me real sad.
*  I remember thinking, like, how does someone who's that, he's killing it.
*  He's got his own TV show.
*  He's hilarious.
*  Handsome.
*  Is the Man the guy from Charlie and the Charlie Factory?
*  Yeah, I just saw it.
*  What the fuck?
*  Oh, that's not as cool anymore.
*  The Man's the old guy laying in bed with other guys.
*  Dog, these motherfuckers were shooting guns at the Comedy Store.
*  Him and fucking Pryor were shooting guns.
*  Well, is that cocaine, man?
*  That cocaine, those guns.
*  Don't know, don't know.
*  That cocaine, those guns.
*  Think about it.
*  He was hanging out at the Comedy Store, that kid.
*  And he was at the, him, Kaplan, they were all at the Comedy Store at that time.
*  And you gotta think, he's also super famous, rich as fuck, 21 and doing coke.
*  This kid.
*  Yeah.
*  How old was he when he died?
*  Real young.
*  How old was Freddie Prinze when he died?
*  I don't even think he was.
*  I don't think he was 30.
*  I don't think he was 30.
*  Yes, that's his son.
*  Yeah, that's his son.
*  How old is he?
*  Twenty.
*  Twenty-two?
*  He was 22 and a half?
*  Jesus Christ!
*  Twenty-two.
*  Holy shit, man.
*  You know why I still remember that night?
*  Holy shit.
*  You want me to tell you why I remember that night?
*  Who?
*  You want me to tell you why I remember that night specifically?
*  Why?
*  Because I had to, on the way home, it was so fucking cold that I had to cut through the
*  cemetery.
*  And when I was walking through the cemetery, I had to take a shit.
*  Oh, no.
*  And I went in front of a fucking casket.
*  The guy had been buried in like 1920.
*  So I go, fuck it.
*  He's got no family left, right?
*  It was freezing, Joe Rogan, freezing.
*  I pull my pants down to my knees.
*  I squat.
*  I take a shit and I start pissing.
*  And all of a sudden I go to get up and I pissed in my own pants.
*  My pants were frozen.
*  I had to walk home like the Tin Man because the piss went right into the fucking pants.
*  So my pants, and I walked in and my mother was there.
*  Oh my God.
*  And she's like, there was, my mother would do surprise attacks on Friday nights on me,
*  like fucked up.
*  Like she gave me the clearance, but like once a month I get a surprise attack.
*  And that was one of the surprise attacks.
*  But I walked in with pee on me and she's like, what are we doing here?
*  What do I gotta do?
*  What do I gotta do?
*  I gotta kill another chicken?
*  Are you retarded?
*  Are you fucking retarded?
*  What are we doing here?
*  Yeah.
*  I can't take this no more.
*  Your son walks in with frozen piss all over his pants.
*  What are we doing here?
*  It's the funniest shit you could say.
*  And every time my mother, every time I came home with an idea, my mother turned to Santeria.
*  Like that's it.
*  I gotta call you godmother.
*  I can't handle this no more.
*  When I started dressing up like Bruce Lee and I had incense in my room and a bowl of
*  rice, she was going nuts.
*  Did you have to come for clothes?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Did you have to come for the buttons?
*  Oh I had the outfit, the white shirt that you folded.
*  I bowed.
*  There's quite a few dudes who adopt that look.
*  I only ate rice.
*  I fucking learned how to use chomp sticks and my mother would go, that's it.
*  You gotta go to your godmother's office.
*  You got a problem.
*  You're retarded.
*  Something's wrong with you.
*  You're not Chinese, stupid.
*  You're not Chinese.
*  And that would make up reasons why I was Chinese and stupid.
*  It used to be that you could dress like you did kung fu.
*  Nobody would even say anything.
*  They'd be like, they're guys really into the arts.
*  You could walk around with them little skinny, tiny black cloth shoes with a tiny tan heel.
*  Remember those, Joey?
*  They're basically slippers.
*  They were slippers.
*  They were like kung fu slippers.
*  And dudes wore white socks and they would have the full kung fu outfit on.
*  And they'd just walk around the street like that.
*  And you'd be like, all right, what are you going to do?
*  And then right before...
*  Then they had us the kung fu shoes.
*  Oh I had those.
*  I had those.
*  Dude, you just walk around with those, man.
*  They would walk around with those shoes.
*  And it's just, it's a nice shortcut to like instantly you seem like a guy who thinks of things in a different way.
*  You seem spiritual.
*  You're in touch with your chi and your energy.
*  You can talk about Chinese medicine.
*  You can say a lot of stupid shit if you're wearing those slippers and some dumb kung fu clothes.
*  I used to walk around with that shit.
*  My girlfriends make me do this right now.
*  Like have outdoor slippers, indoor slippers and like slippers I can leave the house with.
*  That's a good move just for your health.
*  Yeah, but have three different slippers.
*  The problem is if you leave your shoes on when you come in the house, you're tracking all kinds of garbage from outside.
*  That is actually a good move.
*  Sure, I'm going to tell you something.
*  But the kung fu outfit? Not so much.
*  No, no.
*  About three weeks before my mother died, she would never be home on Friday nights because she was a degenerate gambler.
*  So she would hit the tracks on Friday nights.
*  But every once in a while she'd surprise attack me.
*  I'd have to use the vizine.
*  I would drink Boone's Farm.
*  Yeah, strawberry field.
*  Strawberry Boone's Farm.
*  That's how I started.
*  Strawberry Hill.
*  And then I wouldn't really drink as much.
*  My thing was the marijuana.
*  That was my thing.
*  I didn't want her to catch me so I vizined it and I tried to act normal.
*  And fucking, I got high with this girl and I didn't know.
*  We were swapping spit and I ate her monkey and she was bleeding.
*  I didn't know.
*  I didn't even know what period existed.
*  I didn't know what the fuck it was.
*  And I walk in my house and I had a little bit of blood on my lip.
*  And my mother's like, what are you, the wolf man?
*  I'll never forget.
*  She asked me, ¿qué te pasó compadre?
*  Did she know?
*  No.
*  Did she know what it was?
*  No.
*  I didn't tell her that I was embarrassed.
*  I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.
*  I was 15 years old.
*  Didn't you think she just assumed?
*  That it was blood from a period?
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  Wouldn't she ask you if you got in a fight then?
*  She asked me what happened and I was like, I cut my lip.
*  And she's like, ¿cómo?
*  ¿Cómo te cortaste tu lip?
*  And I'm like, I don't know.
*  And I made up some fucking fake story.
*  But don't you think she knew you were lying?
*  Moms know.
*  You lying to a mom.
*  I did that once and went to Starbucks but I was like 35.
*  She caught me with a girl once.
*  And the girl was hiding in the closet.
*  And I'll never forget.
*  My mom came into my room, looked around, looked at me and she just slid the closet.
*  It was those sliding closets.
*  And the girl was just standing there topless.
*  And she goes, ¿Get out?
*  ¿Puta?
*  And then she would call the boards and shit.
*  No.
*  No. Oh my God.
*  I used to date the girl that lived in my backyard.
*  The poor girl.
*  I used to date a girl that our backyards connected.
*  We were in love in the sixth grade.
*  It's the reason why I got left back.
*  In the sixth grade I fell in love.
*  No sex.
*  I fell in love.
*  No sex at all.
*  I just fell in love with her.
*  She made me a promise that in June when school ended we were going to start dating officially.
*  We could make out and shit.
*  Before that we would just hug and kiss each other in the cheek.
*  And we would play hooky and do stupid shit and go to Union City.
*  And I'd spend money on her at this little amusement park and shit.
*  And one day they fucking called home and my mother answered the phone.
*  And my mom started yelling.
*  And the girl's parents were home.
*  And my mom started yelling.
*  ¡Oh, Santonio!
*  ¿Dónde estás?
*  ¿Estás con esa jodera de por encima?
*  So me and her walk into her house.
*  And her mother pulls me aside and she goes,
*  The things your mother is saying,
*  I should go over there and smack her in the face.
*  And I almost told her,
*  Listen, if you go over there, my mom will break you in fucking half.
*  You got the wrong lady.
*  She just stabbed the motherfucker three weeks ago.
*  You're not going to go over there and say nothing to my mother.
*  And I remember walking in and my mother being pissed.
*  I wasn't allowed to hang out with that girl no more.
*  You know, I was in the sixth grade, seventh grade.
*  My mom didn't want me to be a freak.
*  She didn't want me to fucking have a girlfriend.
*  She was like totally against it.
*  Like not to you in the eighth grade.
*  My mom would yell at me in the ninth grade if I was in the bedroom
*  and I had the door shut.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, the door open.
*  No, I guess it was tenth grade.
*  Fifteen is when I really started getting some action.
*  Fourteen was a rough year.
*  I had this friend.
*  I had this tight friend called Eddie.
*  Let's just leave it at Eddie, all right?
*  We were tight.
*  I loved Eddie.
*  Eddie and me were tight.
*  He was the one that turned me on how to roll a joint.
*  Eddie was a couple years older than me and he had a girlfriend
*  that was a couple years older than me.
*  Eddie's family picked up one day and went to Miami.
*  Just like that.
*  Left him behind?
*  Left a chick behind.
*  Left this beautiful German girl behind.
*  So she lived on Charles Court.
*  In fact, she lived next to where the Iceman,
*  the guy that was the Iceman.
*  The murderer?
*  Yeah, the guy that was his buddy, the ice cream truck, Mr. Softy.
*  That's where he lived, Prong Guy.
*  So Elona was her name.
*  She was a hot German girl.
*  And on Friday nights after Eddie left, we were just friends.
*  She was way older than me.
*  We were just fucking friends.
*  We would watch Chico and the Man and Samford and Son.
*  One night she asked me, do you want to go to the ice cream truck?
*  One night she asked me, do you want to make out?
*  I didn't even know how to make out with a girl.
*  We made out together and that was it.
*  Every Friday she'd come over, we'd eat pizza,
*  and we'd make out for a little while.
*  No sex.
*  Nothing like that.
*  That took years.
*  Years?
*  Who was I fucking talking to?
*  I was just telling somebody, I grew up with Catholic girls.
*  You had to talk a lot of shit around Catholic girls.
*  You had to go for it.
*  It took a long time to take a Catholic girl's bra off.
*  And as they popped the cork off that champagne,
*  those gals was good to go.
*  The Catholic girls?
*  Yes, they're the biggest freaks.
*  But the first night is not good.
*  They cry, you've got to walk them home and rub their back
*  and tell them they're not going to go to hell.
*  Because that's the big thing, they start about going to hell.
*  I think with the internet, they're less likely to worry about going to hell.
*  No, no, I'm talking about 1970 Catholic girls.
*  I had one girlfriend that that happened,
*  and it was the longest night of my fucking life.
*  She called me when she got home.
*  This is 78.
*  That beats that.
*  And she went to an all-girls academy.
*  You understand me?
*  So I played at St. Michael CYO.
*  The home of Tommy Motherfucking Heintzen, if anybody knows anything.
*  Hey!
*  And she went to the school that she lead for us.
*  So I dated and eventually something happened and it was brutal.
*  It was brutal.
*  The crying.
*  The crying, the guilt for two days.
*  What a terrible thing, worrying that you're going to go to hell because you did what your body wants.
*  I had the same guilt, bro.
*  I could not believe it.
*  After that I went straight.
*  I was like, this isn't going to happen again until I marry a woman.
*  That's how fucking Catholic I was, guys.
*  The crazy thing is they didn't tell us anything about birth control.
*  They didn't tell us shit.
*  Everybody was already fucking before anybody got to talk to.
*  Everybody was already fucking by the time they were 16.
*  And when you're 17, your dad or your mom or school, someone's going to pull you aside and say,
*  well, if you're going to have sex, like, gonna.
*  Everybody around you is fucking.
*  You leave these 16, 17-year-olds together.
*  They go to birthday parties together.
*  They're drinking.
*  Everybody's fucking.
*  Everybody's fucking.
*  They're fucking when they're 16 all the time.
*  That's so normal.
*  I don't know what age people fucked at when they were like in the 1950s when our parents were growing up.
*  I don't know what the number is.
*  Desi and Lucy didn't fuck.
*  They slept in separate beds.
*  They slept in separate beds.
*  All those TV shows, they slept in separate beds.
*  But do you think people did less fucking or do you think they did less talking about it?
*  Oh, fuck you.
*  They fucked and sucked.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  They fucked the shit out of Marilyn Monroe, didn't they?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They did.
*  They fucked that poor woman to death.
*  Almost to death.
*  Bro, I know this dude that you know that Marilyn Monroe fucked him when he was 16 and she was 22.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  We know that dude.
*  You know who I'm talking about?
*  He played the, he was the guy in that song.
*  Should we give him up?
*  Huh?
*  Tom Hanks.
*  No.
*  It wasn't Tom Hanks.
*  It's your boy.
*  Yeah, it was.
*  No, it's Gianni.
*  That's why he's trying to get out of here.
*  It's Gianni whatever.
*  The guy that Sonny beats up and the Godfather.
*  Yeah.
*  You didn't know that?
*  I think I did.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the guy that Sonny beats up and the Godfather.
*  My memory is full.
*  It's really full.
*  Like, over this last, I mean I know I'm 53 so I'm like officially old now.
*  I've been officially old for at least eight years.
*  But like now like officially officially old, like my memory is full.
*  It's like I can still pull stuff up that I know but like the new stuff, it's hard to get in there.
*  And there's a lot of old stuff I'm just deleting left and right.
*  I forget what I have for lunch.
*  But if you read the article I told you to read a long time ago.
*  Which one?
*  The one about...
*  Gianni Russo said he lost his virginity in Marilyn Monroe at 15.
*  Woo!
*  That's what's up!
*  See, this is the difference.
*  If that's some horrible man who did that to a 15-year-old girl, it's a crime.
*  But we're all excited for him.
*  Imagine you're a 15-year-old.
*  And Marilyn Monroe throws you a piece of ass.
*  Even the cops would smack you.
*  Marilyn Monroe, 15.
*  Can you imagine today one of these mothers from Studio City,
*  I want to speak to an officer, Marilyn Monroe, fuck my son.
*  The cop would even smack her in the face.
*  Shut the fuck up, UW.
*  Can you imagine a kid so lucky?
*  He fucked Marilyn Monroe when he was 15.
*  He's so lucky.
*  She probably sat on his face and shit, tremendous.
*  It's sort of like that.
*  There's some guys that have this weird relationship.
*  Jason Priestley was in it, I think.
*  Oh, no shit.
*  In the 90s.
*  I don't remember that one.
*  It's probably not about that movie, but it's a dramatized version of a young dude
*  in a relationship with Marilyn Monroe.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Listen, man, I think it's amazing that she was willing to do that.
*  I think it's amazing.
*  She'd find some 15-year-old kid and go,
*  I'm going to freak this fucking kid out.
*  I'm Marilyn Monroe.
*  I'm going to fuck a gardener.
*  I'm going to fuck some 15-year-old kid pushing a lawnmower.
*  Let's do it, baby.
*  You imagine you're on the couch, 15-year-old kid,
*  and Marilyn Monroe just grabs your dick and sticks it inside of her.
*  You're like, what?
*  How is this happening?
*  You remember that iconic video of her standing on the subway grate in Manhattan.
*  It's blown her skirt up.
*  And here is Marilyn Monroe riding you.
*  And you imagine him telling his friends, and they're like,
*  get the fuck out of here.
*  Exactly.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  You didn't fuck no Marilyn Monroe.
*  Billy is so full of shit.
*  You won't believe his latest lie.
*  What if she was that gross, though?
*  She was so drugged up and drunk that people are like,
*  ew, get her away from me.
*  Put her over next to that 15-year-old kid.
*  No.
*  Brian, there's video of her before she died.
*  There's video of her the year that she was still alive before she died.
*  She was beautiful.
*  That movie was based off of this.
*  That old I Had a Secret show.
*  It's like the guy went on and said I had a date with Marilyn Monroe.
*  And she paid for it.
*  Oh my god.
*  So then the movie came out in 1983.
*  Dude, I have so much more respect for her now.
*  I just think if I was a female famous actor,
*  that'd be the most gangstrous thing to do.
*  Fuck high school seniors.
*  Just grab them.
*  Get in the limo, bitch.
*  No one would have a problem with it.
*  No one would have a problem with it.
*  Everybody would have a problem with everything.
*  We would all be laughing, though.
*  But if the biggest movie star in the world was scooping up high school seniors
*  and blowing them, nobody would get mad at them.
*  I would get mad at them.
*  That's crazy.
*  I think that's happening.
*  There was a gym teacher in my school that fucked.
*  No one's at school right now.
*  There was a female gym teacher in my school that fucked everybody.
*  Didn't fuck me.
*  She didn't like me.
*  She fucked everybody.
*  We used to drop people off in the house.
*  You ever drop, like Redman, where you going to tell?
*  You guys gotta drop me off at Ms. Whatever's house.
*  And she would just fuck the kids?
*  Yeah.
*  How old?
*  She had to be in her 30s.
*  No, how old were the kids?
*  16, 15.
*  17.
*  Whoever's ready to party.
*  Everybody gave her a fucking stab.
*  Now, did everybody talk about it?
*  How many people talked about it?
*  It was well known.
*  Did the teachers know about it?
*  Or did the kids keep their mouth shut?
*  I think the teachers...
*  That's the difference between today and then.
*  I think she was giving pussy to the teachers, too.
*  She ended up marrying one of the teachers.
*  Wow.
*  Did she?
*  I'm not sure.
*  She was a hot blonde.
*  She was a hot blonde.
*  And then there was a chick in our high school that just liked older guys.
*  And I remember we were in summer school.
*  And we were standing outside.
*  And this chick was fucking hammered.
*  She had to be 16, 15, my age, sophomore summer.
*  And right in front of everybody, she just went up to the vice principal hammered
*  and just started grabbing his dick and going, let's get out of here, baby.
*  And he's like, all right, everybody can go play now.
*  And fucking he just froze.
*  I know the girl.
*  I'm friends with her on Facebook today.
*  Really?
*  She's got kids.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  She got kids, the whole fucking deal.
*  And I talked to her from time to time.
*  Say hello.
*  That's hilarious.
*  She was a freak when I was a kid.
*  There was always a neighborhood freak.
*  There was a neighborhood freak in my neighborhood.
*  Fucked all the kids that played softball.
*  She was hot.
*  She was 21.
*  Always had torn jeans.
*  They always knew a lot about rock.
*  They always introduced you to some old Sabbath.
*  She'd play some old zeppelin.
*  Like, I didn't know.
*  I was musically illiterate at the point.
*  I learned a lot about music from this lady.
*  She's a nice lady.
*  Does she smell like cigarettes?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought it was hot.
*  My street girl smelled like cigarettes.
*  I thought it was hot.
*  I thought girls that smell like a woman that smelled like she smoked cigarettes, it was hot.
*  So this is like a dangerous lady.
*  Doesn't give a fuck about cancer.
*  That's my rationale when I was a kid.
*  I thought it was the dumbest thing for you to do for your health.
*  But I also thought it was hot if girls smoked cigarettes.
*  I'll tell you how hard it was in my neighborhood to score.
*  That on Facebook, most of the kids I'm friends with from my neighborhood, they married their high school sweethearts.
*  That's how anti-sex, not anti-sex, but that's my high school was very old school.
*  Old school.
*  Old fashioned.
*  It was very old fashioned.
*  Marry your high school sweetheart.
*  If you took a Spanish girl on a date, you had to go with a grandma the first three or four days.
*  Italian girls, sometimes you got to bring the grandma with you.
*  It was a different time.
*  I didn't learn about sugar daddies and all that shit.
*  When I moved to Seattle, I heard all that nonsense.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the shit that you hear once you move here.
*  I had never been raised around that shit.
*  I'm a criminal.
*  I don't know nothing about that fucking Islands and Tom Hanks and fucking what the fuck.
*  What the fuck?
*  And you hear this shit, the Epstein, I don't know what to believe.
*  I don't think Tom Hanks is a part of that.
*  The Tom Hanks thing is more or less an internet meme.
*  It's like a joke that they're pretending that Tom Hanks is a pedophile.
*  But the Epstein thing is real.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  It's like there's so much talk about all these other things when there's a whole log of people that went to this island where the guy was a pedophile who was known for having underage girls.
*  And he didn't really kill himself and everybody knows it.
*  So everybody knows somebody killed him.
*  Did you take the over?
*  What's the over?
*  I took the over that they're going to bomb that place where they have it.
*  Oh, the lane?
*  They can't choke her.
*  No.
*  They can't choke her and they can't suicide her.
*  So there's either going to be some type of disruption.
*  Corona.
*  Some type of disruption.
*  Corona.
*  A heavy dose of Corona.
*  Well, that was one of the things I talked to Oliver Stone about with Jack Ruby.
*  He said that Jack Ruby getting cancer and dying so quickly.
*  Like that didn't really make sense.
*  That they were working on things that you could do to people where you could inject them and they'd get cancer and die.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. Corona is either going to be...
*  Who knows?
*  It's going to be interesting to see what happens.
*  They're going to blow her out of there.
*  If she has to testify, the fucking Marines got to go.
*  Yeah.
*  The Marines got to go.
*  E-bike accident.
*  Like poor Simon.
*  Poor fucking Simon.
*  That poor bastard.
*  He broke his back.
*  What he was on though, I have two e-bikes.
*  I'm addicted to that lifestyle.
*  But what he was on is like a motorbike.
*  It's like a Tron motorcycle that has the torque of a Tesla.
*  Oh no.
*  It's like...
*  He was on one of those?
*  One of those.
*  What's he doing?
*  I don't know.
*  I think...
*  No helmet?
*  I think it's fun.
*  It's like having a Tesla as a bike.
*  But is it a motorcycle or is it a scooter?
*  Do you need a license?
*  It's classified.
*  Instead of a motorbike like X-Game style, it's just e-battery.
*  When we were in Austin, I was watching those drunk fucks roll by on those scooters.
*  I was like, do you need a license for that?
*  You should have a fucking license.
*  These guys are going kind of fast.
*  You're supposed to.
*  When you sign up for the thing, you're supposed to take a picture of your ID and shit.
*  If you fall going 15 miles an hour, you are fucked.
*  I don't know if you realize how fucked you are.
*  If you fall on concrete and you're going 15 miles an hour, you're fucked.
*  One of them goes 38.
*  38.
*  Yeah, and it's just like...
*  38.
*  Jamie's got a crazy one.
*  You got to know how to fall too.
*  Listen, bitch.
*  You're hitting the concrete and electric poles.
*  It hurts.
*  Oh my God, stop.
*  You don't understand.
*  If you hit something at 30 miles an hour...
*  That's way different than 15.
*  Okay, let's say 15.
*  You hit something at 15 miles an hour, you hit the concrete and a pole at 15 miles an hour.
*  You have no understanding of what you weigh.
*  200 pounds?
*  The ones you rent off the street, they're limited to only go 13 miles an hour or something like that.
*  If you hit a pole at 13 miles an hour...
*  Listen to me, Jamie.
*  You're going to get fucked up.
*  You're going to get fucked up.
*  Like really fucked up.
*  That's full sprint, I know.
*  I get it.
*  Woo!
*  But I'm saying that if you just walk in a pole...
*  I don't run into poles though.
*  Well, you don't, but other folks are intoxicated.
*  You're very well coordinated.
*  But I'm saying it's kind of crazy.
*  You can just pick one of these things up with no license, and you're going 15 miles an hour booking down the street.
*  These are the ones you rent on the street?
*  You're supposed to have a license.
*  You have to have a license.
*  Whether or not you do it without, you can give it to your kid.
*  But as you sign up for it, you're giving a liability.
*  You take a picture of your license.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So you have to have a driver's license.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's better.
*  Not buying.
*  That's better.
*  Yeah, not to buy it.
*  But it's definitely more complicated than driving a car, right?
*  You've got to balance on that thing.
*  Eh.
*  A bike?
*  You!
*  But if someone's a slob...
*  Right?
*  It's not hard to balance.
*  But if someone just has no coordination, they just get on one of those things.
*  It's just a bike.
*  Scooter?
*  Oh, scooter.
*  It's just scooters that are everywhere.
*  Yeah, I don't like the scooters.
*  You can go fast.
*  Yeah, you can go as fast.
*  There's scooters that go 45 miles an hour that you can buy.
*  Come on.
*  We can't do that.
*  You need a helmet.
*  Where's your fucking helmet?
*  Oh yeah, you definitely have to.
*  You're going 40 miles an hour, where's your helmet?
*  It's real common though.
*  But listen, at least if people fall down, they're not...
*  You could fucking wipe into somebody.
*  You could wipe into somebody and hurt them pretty bad.
*  Keep your eyes open.
*  They banned them in Hoboken.
*  They banned them.
*  They banned them because they were being dropped all over the place and people were hurting themselves.
*  That's just another fucking headache for people.
*  It's weird because you can just leave them on the sidewalk.
*  You leave them on the sidewalk.
*  But they're not really parked.
*  People are doing them at night.
*  Yeah.
*  You're taking the chance.
*  Every time you get on one of those fucking things, it's a fucking nightmare.
*  Whoever invented that...
*  I support people's right to do it.
*  No, I don't give a fuck.
*  Let them do it.
*  But don't come crying to me when you get hit in the fuck by a truck.
*  Don't come crying to me then.
*  I wouldn't advise any of my friends, especially if they're intoxicated.
*  They'll just take this home?
*  No.
*  If you're thinking, should I take this home?
*  You definitely shouldn't take that home.
*  Because a mistake, one fucking mistake...
*  Doug, listen, Joe Rogan.
*  I think I do on this too, I think.
*  What's that?
*  Operating while intoxicated.
*  Can you?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Absolutely.
*  That makes sense.
*  Of course you.
*  My brother, I took a bike riding during this quarantine.
*  I saw.
*  You know what time I leave my house?
*  I follow you on Patreon.
*  8.15.
*  8.15 a.m.
*  Do you know why I do that?
*  There's a reason.
*  Why?
*  Because there's nobody out.
*  Yeah.
*  I go against the grain.
*  I don't let cars behind me.
*  I go against cars.
*  You got something to say?
*  You shut your fucking mouth.
*  Yeah.
*  I wear a hooded sweatshirt with a 22 just in case.
*  Jesus, don't tell people that.
*  I don't wear headphones.
*  I put my mask on like a decent fucking American.
*  And I take that fucking bike from to Hunger to fucking to Luka Lake.
*  I don't sometimes I go on the sidewalk, whatever.
*  But trust me, I know that I'm in danger of getting hit.
*  Every time I get on those bikes, I say a prayer because there's a lot of motherfuckers texting.
*  I see it.
*  You when you're on a bike, you got to work hard now.
*  A scooter.
*  You're in danger.
*  You're in danger.
*  You're in danger.
*  You're best bet is to get a bike and go on the Chandler Trail.
*  That's what normal people would do.
*  You're pretty safe there.
*  You know, I've done that a lot too.
*  But the Chandler Trail is kind of weird.
*  There's people walking.
*  Right.
*  You know, and there's people with fucking dogs.
*  They're going to take their dogs everywhere.
*  Can people believe the fucking dogs are home in California?
*  You're going to know.
*  The other day I was hungry.
*  I went to eat and the lady sitting there with a fucking dog, social distancing.
*  The dog can't stay home.
*  Not one day.
*  Everybody in California got to fucking take a dog.
*  They have emotional support dogs.
*  And a long fucking leash.
*  Emotional dogs.
*  Take Xanax like everybody else.
*  Do a line of fucking coke.
*  Wait until coke is up to 1,800 an ounce.
*  Is it really?
*  1,800 an ounce.
*  What did it used to be?
*  Six.
*  They were giving it away three years ago.
*  What happened?
*  Uh, COVID.
*  Borders are closed.
*  COVID and they got an extra six.
*  Borders are closed?
*  Oh, it's hard to get in.
*  COVID and they got an extra 600 a week on unemployment.
*  What are you kidding me?
*  Do you see that new Mexican tunnel they just found?
*  Oh yeah.
*  The most complicated tunnel they've ever discovered.
*  That's an easy one.
*  Have you seen that Jamie?
*  They gave them that one.
*  Let me see that shit.
*  Remember they built 20 at a time.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And they want you to find one.
*  They sacrificed one so you have a big victory for Fox News.
*  Yeah, you're jumping up and down.
*  Mexican drug lords stopped at the border.
*  The most sophisticated tunnel in US history.
*  Discovered between Mexico and Arizona.
*  Although it's not exactly clear what the structure was intended for,
*  it had ventilation, a rail system, and extensive reinforcement.
*  Yeah, look at that shit dude.
*  That's how the vampires come in.
*  That's how they got El Chapo out.
*  You ever see that?
*  The El Chapo one's amazing.
*  El Chapo goes to take a shit and never returns.
*  He goes behind this little thing.
*  The only thing that keeps the camera from seeing him taking a shit
*  is a thing where you can't see him when he's sitting.
*  So it's like, think about this high.
*  So he turns around towards where the toilet is,
*  ducks down and disappears forever from sight.
*  Like he's taking a shit for like five hours.
*  They go in and check on the guy.
*  They find out there's a door behind the shitter
*  and he's got a tunnel built in there with a rail system.
*  Like a real rail system and lighting and electricity.
*  He goes a mile long.
*  So he gets under the tunnel.
*  He gets in there.
*  They take him off before the fucking people in the jail can realize he's gone.
*  He's a mile away.
*  He pops out of this building.
*  He gets out of this building and they swoop him up in a truck or whatever.
*  Or a helicopter.
*  They get him the fuck out of there.
*  But it's hilarious.
*  Watch.
*  He goes behind this thing to take a shit.
*  He's like, this is like his take a shit area.
*  And when he does it, he just disappears.
*  So here's his take a shit area.
*  He's like, I'm just going to take my pants off real quick.
*  Let me lean forward.
*  Ducks down.
*  Boom.
*  He's through the floor.
*  He's gone.
*  They had it all set up for him.
*  They popped him out on the other end.
*  His son got arrested recently.
*  And then they released him.
*  They're like, fuck it.
*  They got surrounded by cartel people.
*  They negotiated and they just released him.
*  It was crazy.
*  That's a complete different world.
*  It's a different world.
*  It's right there, bro.
*  You can walk there.
*  If you live in La Jolla, you can walk there, son.
*  How crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  Pretty crazy.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  There he is.
*  Guys, everything's cool.
*  Relax.
*  The fucking...
*  Let him go.
*  The fucking Pablo Escobar two seasons were very good.
*  That guy who plays Escobar is incredible.
*  The guy...
*  What's his name?
*  I don't know.
*  He's Panamanian, whatever.
*  Is he Panamanian?
*  Jamie's going to pull it up.
*  That guy needs his respect.
*  He's so good.
*  Then you have the season of the Cali Cartel.
*  Yeah, I didn't make it.
*  That one was...
*  Too many murders.
*  Yeah.
*  That one opens up with them burying a guy.
*  Wagner Moura.
*  I think he's from Brazil.
*  Yeah, Brazilian.
*  But sorry.
*  He got tormented because his Spanish was bad.
*  Fuck them people.
*  The guy could act his ass off.
*  Oh, he could act his ass off.
*  But then you had season, the Cali Cartel.
*  That was good.
*  The season opened up when they rip a guy apart with motorcycles.
*  They put a motorcycle on each leg and they just tear him apart.
*  That's the season opener.
*  So you know it.
*  And the guy is gay.
*  That runs the click.
*  So he goes to their party, gets a bottle, fucking takes over the dance floor, makes
*  out with his gay lover, takes the bottle, breaks it over the guy's head, then ties
*  him up with a motorcycle and rips him apart.
*  Fucking tremendous opening.
*  Oh my God.
*  Then we skip the Cali Cartel.
*  What season is this?
*  This is season three and four.
*  Or season three is the Cali Cartel.
*  Then it goes into season, Narcos, Mexico, and to me in my world.
*  And you know me, dog.
*  I come at you with Laurence Fishburne.
*  I'll tell you who's really doing their craft right.
*  Who are pimps of the game right now.
*  We've seen who are the major pimps of the fucking game.
*  Right now the major pimps of the game that you and I have seen in our lifetime have been
*  guys like Laurence Fishburne.
*  This kid who does John Wick is doing a great fucking job.
*  The English guy is the real deal.
*  Say what you want about my...
*  Nah.
*  He's amazing.
*  Say what you want about...
*  No, the other English dude.
*  The one that was in The Fighter.
*  The one...
*  You see Capone?
*  The one in The Fighting?
*  You want to shoot yourself in the head two times.
*  Leave me alone with Tom Hardy.
*  Tom Hardy was good with Gandolfini.
*  That's the best thing fucking Tom Hardy did that and the fucking Bronson.
*  Christian Bale.
*  What?
*  Christian Bale is fucking the real deal.
*  You got to rock with Christian Bale.
*  But the dude who fucking does Marcos Mexico, the little dude, that dude is on a different
*  level.
*  He's on a different level.
*  He takes that show to a different level.
*  You can't take your eyes off him.
*  And I didn't even know that this Latin theater existed.
*  When I was a kid I watched Telemundo and telenovelas.
*  That's the gay one.
*  He's tremendous.
*  That's the gay one.
*  That's the sick...
*  That's when they're in Cali Cartel.
*  This is all good stuff.
*  But the guy, Marcos Mexico, he's so fucking good.
*  It's scary how good he is.
*  He does two seasons.
*  He's the one that...
*  And I saw, he tells the story of what happened in New York.
*  We were buying brown weed.
*  And all of a sudden they were selling a weed called sensamilla.
*  And it was a weed that was grown with no seeds.
*  So it was easier to pack and easier to smuggle.
*  So they had to convince these people that this was the future.
*  But there's a problem with sensamilla.
*  It has to be grown in the desert.
*  It can't be grown anywhere else because a male plant will fuck up the whole thing.
*  So it's got to be grown in the desert.
*  Who grows weed in the desert?
*  These motherfuckers set up an irrigation thing.
*  Explain the male female plant thing.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know nothing about it.
*  But Jamie, when he gets a minute...
*  I know it.
*  I know it's a thing.
*  They can switch genders.
*  But the flowery ones are the females.
*  Like marijuana.
*  You want to make sure that they're female.
*  Make sure the males don't fuck them over and switch them.
*  I don't know how they can get too close and change each other.
*  Can you see the biggest crop seeds from narcos?
*  So marijuana grows in transphobic.
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  These motherfuckers...
*  Look at the size of this fucking...
*  This went on for days where they just grew this weed.
*  And they would do it right before...
*  Do you know how to grow weed?
*  No.
*  Every time I do it, I fail.
*  But this, they show you how...
*  Damn.
*  They show you how...
*  Look at that.
*  Look at the size of those...
*  How did Netflix pull this off?
*  What do they do?
*  It's brilliant.
*  Do you think it's all CGI?
*  A lot of CGI mixed with fake...
*  Some plants.
*  You can have real plants.
*  They're legal now.
*  Well, they're probably just plastic.
*  But this guy devised a system...
*  This guy devised a system that he knew that there was water in the desert.
*  And that's where they grew this weed.
*  And this kid here, he could eat motherfuckers alive for breakfast when he was acting.
*  That dude there, that little Mexican right there...
*  And I watched him a couple times and I go,
*  There's something special about this kid.
*  I'm not going to look him up or whatever.
*  And I finally looked him up.
*  His mother died when he was three.
*  And his father was a stagehand in Mexico.
*  So his father was a set designer.
*  Which means that he grew up around his father on the set.
*  His father on the set designing,
*  which made him a little bit more creative than the average fucking kid.
*  He was also in Star Wars.
*  This kid will eat motherfuckers up for lunch when they let him go.
*  He's going to eat motherfuckers up for lunch when they let him go.
*  They just...
*  Narcos was his shit.
*  He was that good Diego Luna.
*  That fucking good Joe Rogan.
*  Steals it.
*  There's even one episode where he tells his wife,
*  I don't need you anymore.
*  You can go.
*  Whoa.
*  Cold-blooded.
*  And how he does it, the whole...
*  From A to Z.
*  From A to Z.
*  How he started with weed first.
*  And then he went on a mission to do a favor.
*  And he saw cocaine in Nicaragua.
*  And he goes, all the cocaine is stuck in Nicaragua.
*  Why is it stuck in Nicaragua?
*  Because they had closed the routes from Miami.
*  So he went to fucking Cali Cartel.
*  They told him, you got two choices.
*  You got the Cali Cartel, they're legit businessmen.
*  They don't even look like drug dealers.
*  But then we got another guy that's very emotional.
*  So you have to pick who you want to go with.
*  He went with the businessmen.
*  Cut a deal.
*  On the way to the airport, they get kidnapped.
*  Kidnapped.
*  They take them right to Pablo's house.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  It is one of the greatest fucking scenes ever.
*  With how Pablo talks to him.
*  He says, what did you...
*  Are you doing here?
*  I went to Cali.
*  Pablo lights up a fucking joint.
*  Pablo's talking to him.
*  He went to Cali.
*  Okay.
*  And then he goes, what are you going to do with a hippopotamus?
*  Pablo had a hippopotamus.
*  And Pablo's telling him he loves hippopotamuses
*  because they're smooth and all this shit.
*  And the whole time he's just smoking a joint.
*  He goes, I'm going to cut you a deal.
*  For every load you take of theirs, you take one of mine in.
*  And that's how that whole thing began.
*  Oh, the guy agreed to it.
*  Sure, and the guy agreed to it.
*  Smart.
*  Yeah, agreed to it.
*  Don't be greedy, bitch.
*  He goes, because if you do that for me,
*  then you're going to put me out of business.
*  Do you think that Narcos is like the Rocky movies for drug dealers?
*  It's very sad.
*  You know what?
*  The first two seasons of three seasons of Narcos
*  is very sad for a guy like me.
*  Really?
*  Because it shows you the truth of what happened.
*  It shows you that the Colombians had something going on,
*  and once the Americans saw the amount of money,
*  they tapped right into it.
*  That whole thing with Barry Seale and Arkansas,
*  that's all real.
*  We can't rewrite that.
*  It's like the first time you realize the Kennedy hit was done by the CIA
*  or whoever did it.
*  You say to yourself,
*  wow, we have a government that ices their own people.
*  Now they're fucking help bring in these drugs.
*  The same war on drugs that they have on paper,
*  they're profiting off.
*  And then when you look at the fucking weed thing
*  from the Narcos perspective,
*  you don't know the amounts of weed they were bringing in.
*  They were supplying the whole country with green weed.
*  The whole country with Senza Mia.
*  And everybody was in on it.
*  But meanwhile, Reagan is on there with his wife.
*  Just saying no.
*  So you see the hypocrisy, and it kind of hurts you.
*  You go, what the fuck else won't they do?
*  Well, the just say no thing was coming from the same administration
*  that funded the conscious versus the Sandinistas
*  with CIA drug money run through south central LA.
*  And they show him go through.
*  For freeway Ricky Ross, who's been on the podcast twice.
*  Yes, they show him go into...
*  The real Rick Ross.
*  Yeah, they show him.
*  Narcos, the Mexican kid I just told you,
*  they show him go through, because the plane goes down.
*  How they discovered that whole thing was a plane goes down.
*  And all of a sudden Oliver Wood, whatever his name is,
*  Oliver North, Oliver South, whatever his fucking name was.
*  Oliver North.
*  Well, guess what happened?
*  Narcos went to the CIA after they had killed Kiki Camarena.
*  He's the most wanted man in the fucking world
*  for being one of the guys that murdered Kiki Camarena.
*  He shows up at CIA headquarters and goes, whoa, whoa.
*  I got the fucking answer to your problems.
*  What year was this, Jamie?
*  I will continue to bring you fucking weapons.
*  This has happened a couple of times.
*  2007.
*  2007.
*  I think this is a later one.
*  This is one that you and I have brought up before,
*  because it was like a CIA...
*  It was like 2008 also.
*  Of course it is.
*  They fucking crash all the time.
*  There was one that just happened.
*  Didn't one just happen somewhere in the world?
*  They glued them up with cocaine, these fucks.
*  They get greedy.
*  When you get coked up, you're like, it's going to make it.
*  Jesus wants us to land.
*  Just Mexico I looked up.
*  I erased that part.
*  But there was one that just happened, like real, real recently.
*  Afghanistan.
*  There's one that happened...
*  No, that was 2007.
*  There's one that happened like a week ago.
*  Anonymous plane.
*  I got half tons of coke.
*  No, it wasn't a CIA plane that landed recently,
*  but it was one that crashed right after taking off.
*  Overly, they put too much on it.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  It was in New Zealand, right?
*  Or Australia?
*  Melbourne, yeah, Australia.
*  Melbourne, there you go.
*  It's not as much.
*  It's half a ton.
*  They had one of them old fucking propeller planes loaded up with coke.
*  Those planes are the worst.
*  You have to be honest about what you weigh.
*  Like if you get on a plane with your wife and she's like 146 and you're like, pitch, I don't want to die.
*  I used to have to be...
*  You're 152.
*  My mom would make extra money on the side when she worked at Wendy's
*  and take those planes down to Atlanta and drop off stuff.
*  And I just remember being a kid in the backseat reading Garfield going, I'm going to die.
*  How many times did you have to fly on one of those?
*  I'd probably say at least 10 times that I remember.
*  Oh my god.
*  Oh my god.
*  I get sick of those little planes.
*  I get one of those motherfuckers.
*  What was Wendy's dropping off?
*  Like special sauce?
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah, what the fuck?
*  Yeah, man.
*  No, that was an interesting cast.
*  That Narcos is an interesting...
*  They did them right.
*  I think this year they're going to Miami.
*  They killed it with Pablo.
*  They killed it.
*  Killed it.
*  That guy's so good.
*  Killed it.
*  And the guy I liked that they hired was that dude that got like 2,000 years in jail.
*  The one who ran the island, like his story is hilarious.
*  Because he was a John Lennon fanatic.
*  Yeah.
*  And he was half German, so he was a Hitler.
*  But he was Spanish.
*  Okay?
*  And he was...
*  Sounds like a Saturday night live show.
*  So when the cops went, when the feds went all extradite on these guys, they became the
*  extraditables.
*  This guy took to the radio, and they show scenes of him on the radio fucking...
*  Like, okay, so you cannot take us back to the United States because you're the number
*  one export porter of our product.
*  And he snores.
*  All of a sudden he sees like an assistant walk by and he goes, hey, come here.
*  And all of a sudden he's like...
*  And all of a sudden she just kneels down.
*  She's blowing him on camera.
*  What?
*  And he's like, listen to me.
*  You have to...
*  He became nuts.
*  When was this?
*  Listen.
*  Listen to what they did, okay?
*  Hold on.
*  Is there a video of this you can get?
*  Oh my God.
*  Carlos Lader is a fucking lunatic.
*  Carlos Lader was the one who went to Pablo and said, I'm going to fly the coke back for
*  you, but we're going to make a stop on an island.
*  So they bought an island.
*  They fucking threw the doctor off.
*  There was a white doctor that went, nice to meet you.
*  And they were like, listen, there's a whole story about this, it's hysterical.
*  The guy called the feds.
*  There's something going on over there.
*  They're doing pornographic.
*  You know, they're running them planes of blow.
*  Wow.
*  And there's this one...
*  They bought everybody out, but there was this one white dude who was like, this is my island.
*  I'm an American.
*  I fought in World War II.
*  I'm not leaving.
*  And they're like, dog, we're going to fucking kill you.
*  Okay?
*  We're going to keep...
*  And all night they were bringing in planes, refueling them and sending them out.
*  Carlos Lader...
*  What does it say?
*  US drug lord and Escobar partner Lader released in Germany from prison.
*  When was this?
*  Oh my God.
*  He's now.
*  From Florida to Germany.
*  Oh, from Florida to Germany.
*  Because he's originally from Germany.
*  His father was German.
*  He's got 2,000 years.
*  So what they did was this.
*  What they did was this.
*  It doesn't take a fucking genius.
*  This kid got the island.
*  He made them a bunch of money.
*  But then he started doing a podcast from the island with cameras and naked women...
*  What?
*  ...of him snorting coke with a robot.
*  How old was he?
*  Who the fuck knows?
*  28, 30.
*  Just making 20 million a day.
*  Think if you're making 20 million a day and you're just addicted to coke, there's bags of blow behind you.
*  He's just ripping bags open, snorting them, just talking.
*  He was a John Lennon fan.
*  So he would talk about come-tick-days.
*  He would do these videos for hours, for days.
*  So he was like an original YouTube star.
*  Yeah, so what they did was...
*  But he wasn't posting on YouTube.
*  But if he did, he would be huge.
*  So what they did was...
*  He's my space boy.
*  He's the first one they gave up.
*  When the shit got deep and the Colombians were in trouble,
*  the five Colombians sat down.
*  They said, listen, this kid's on an island talking about Jim Morrison and the doors.
*  Let's let the feds know where he's at.
*  We'll give him you and we got no beef.
*  So they extradited, laid there.
*  They gave him 2,000 years.
*  Oh my God.
*  Look up the sentence.
*  I'm not trying to be funny.
*  They gave him 1,000 years.
*  So why was they extradited him to Germany?
*  Because he gave them information years later about...
*  He gave them like vital, he gave them really great information that if the country fucking knew, we would sink.
*  Like he gave them shit.
*  Like what?
*  He gave them information that he also not beside having his island, that that was also a distraction.
*  His main contributor, his main supplier was Fidel.
*  So he, Fidel was letting him go to Cuba, bring the coke to Cuba, stock it.
*  And for every ship that went out from Cuba to the United States with a Cuban flag, Fidel would get a kickback of $800,000.
*  Fidel was sending three, four ships a day.
*  So he testified against Fidel, which obviously nobody ever arrested Fidel.
*  And he told them everything he knew about the ins and outs of money moving.
*  You could find it online, all the shit he had done.
*  This guy in blow is based off of George Young's cellmate in prison.
*  Isn't it funny?
*  Like no one wants their son to do that, but everybody loves these movies.
*  Yeah, that's weird.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  Like Jamie, if you had a son, he'd be a fucking drug dealer.
*  In this movie, his father is Henry Hill.
*  No shit.
*  And he knows that he's doing it.
*  It's a very good movie.
*  Is that real in real life?
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  In the movie.
*  So it's a fictional kid.
*  Ray Liotta plays his father in this movie.
*  Oh, Henry Hill, you mean from?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And one day.
*  I thought you meant the actual Henry Hill.
*  No, fuck Henry Hill.
*  What are the odds?
*  It's a criminal family.
*  All the ideas are translated.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Jamie had a translation.
*  Jamie had a translation for you.
*  Jamie's a psychic.
*  Jamie's a 100% a psychic.
*  It's really crazy you said that because in the movie, he goes to his house one time,
*  the father, and he goes, so all this on the landscaper's, what are you doing son?
*  And he goes, what are you talking about?
*  She comes from wealth.
*  And then he gets busted and stuff.
*  Look at this right here.
*  Look at that old school Corvette.
*  Look at that fucking car.
*  Look at his house.
*  They're from fucking Boston.
*  He's in a palace.
*  Look at that car though.
*  Go wide.
*  Look at that fucking car.
*  That's a generation one Corvette.
*  That's sexy.
*  That's even before mine.
*  Mine is a 65.
*  That's like probably early 60s, maybe even 50s.
*  That thing's amazing.
*  Those cars back then, man.
*  You like that early first series of cars?
*  Yeah, I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  That's a nice first series Corvette.
*  Holy shit.
*  What a car that is.
*  Ron White's got one of those.
*  A sick one.
*  See if you can find it.
*  See if Ron White's Corvette is online.
*  Ron White has a sick Corvette.
*  I got it.
*  I'm going to go piss again.
*  You get out there, big boy.
*  I'm just kidding.
*  Generation one.
*  He has a generation one convertible that's just immaculate.
*  Ron White is got to be one of the coolest people on the planet.
*  Sweetheart.
*  He's got to be one of the coolest people.
*  Owns his own tequila company.
*  Funny as fuck.
*  Always cool to hang with.
*  Never has an attitude.
*  He's never had an attitude.
*  He's always Ron White.
*  What you see is what you get.
*  That's Ron motherfucking White.
*  He's always super sweet, hugs people.
*  Reminds me of what Texas is in a human form.
*  He's fucking awesome.
*  He's just a fucking awesome guy.
*  I love him to death.
*  There's his car.
*  And he's got the dopest choice in vehicles.
*  Look at that.
*  God damn, what a car.
*  Is he having somebody else drive it for him?
*  I think it's probably like when he first got it.
*  NASCAR driver Kurt Busch.
*  Oh wow.
*  He just...
*  Look at that thing, man.
*  God damn, that's pretty.
*  That's so pretty.
*  America knew how to do shit back then, Red Band.
*  I think it's getting more exciting now, honestly, with cars.
*  I love it.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  New stuff.
*  For sure with cars.
*  Cars are the most exciting now.
*  Are you going to get one of those, what's it called?
*  Cybertrucks?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  The Ford Bronco.
*  I have a real Bronco.
*  I have a 1972 Bronco.
*  Those are real.
*  Mine's a manual.
*  It doesn't even have good brakes.
*  There's a thing about Broncos, like those old Broncos, even mine, I have a Coyote engine
*  in it.
*  It's an icon.
*  So Jonathan Ward makes it.
*  They take an eight-cylinder Mustang engine, like if you bought a Mustang GT, and they
*  put that in an old Bronco and tweak everything.
*  But it's still not really fast.
*  It's not supposed to be fast.
*  It's just supposed to be interesting.
*  It's like you're driving this thing.
*  It's like all mechanical and shit.
*  But the new Bronco's not going to be like that.
*  New Bronco's going to be dope, no doubt about it.
*  But it's going to be a different kind of dope.
*  It's going to be like a modern dope.
*  What is that again?
*  Show me what you put.
*  It's interesting.
*  Larger Cybertruck will be North American ass-kicker.
*  Smaller Cybertruck, highly likely and to be sent to countries we hate.
*  You know why, right?
*  North American ass-kicker.
*  The size of the Cybertruck, like Elon wanted to make it smaller because it's bigger than
*  what an average-sized garage is, single-car garage.
*  So that's the problem.
*  That's why there's probably going to be a smaller one.
*  That is a fucking problem.
*  We are gross.
*  We do need things to be as big as humanly possible.
*  If there's a fucking XL Diet Coke, I always get it.
*  I'm like the regular large is not enough.
*  I am thirsty.
*  Americans are greedy.
*  We see a bigger truck.
*  Like Samsung has it nailed, right?
*  They sell you the regular Note and then you can get the Note Ultra.
*  You got a laptop in your pocket, boy.
*  Have you got one of those folds?
*  Did you fall for the fold?
*  The new fold looks pretty badass.
*  It does.
*  There's a new new one, right?
*  It's just coming out.
*  What do I get next, guys?
*  Just keep with your iPhone.
*  iPhone.
*  The thing about iPhones is, here's the thing.
*  When you have ...
*  Wait, the new one's about to be released.
*  When you try the two different platforms, the iPhone got way ahead of everybody with
*  two things.
*  One, AirDrop.
*  AirDrop's so important.
*  Killer.
*  If you make a funny video of something, you see something, I'm like, oh my God, send me
*  that.
*  I get it instantly.
*  Bluetooth.
*  It's fast.
*  It's fast as fuck.
*  Yeah, I'll send gigabyte files to my girlfriend to edit and stuff like that in like 15 seconds.
*  Also, when I send you pictures, if they come through iMessage, they're better quality.
*  They're better resolution.
*  There's a lot of things that you get used to.
*  You get used to iMessage.
*  You get used to the fact that you could answer a message from your laptop if you had a Mac
*  laptop.
*  That's key.
*  There's a lot of shit.
*  Also, buying things with one click.
*  Apple Pay.
*  Yeah, Apple Pay's the shit.
*  The shit.
*  When you go to a supermarket, you can pay with your phone.
*  I've been using that the whole time.
*  Look at yourself today.
*  Do it on your ...
*  Pay for your groceries.
*  It takes three seconds.
*  Watch can do it too.
*  I just do the watch.
*  You feel like you're in the future.
*  If I can pay for things with my phone, I feel like I'm in the future.
*  I love it.
*  You're not touching shit and getting corona and crap.
*  I remember Dana White told me about that in 2005.
*  Bro, in Japan, their phones, they pay for shit with their phones.
*  I was like, what?
*  What?
*  Yeah, they go through things, they pay for things with their phones.
*  They're so far ahead of us.
*  Now, here we are.
*  Joey Diaz, what the fuck happened to you?
*  I'm just thinking about it.
*  I don't like that much information out.
*  Throw me that lighter.
*  I don't like that much information.
*  I wouldn't want to keep ...
*  Yeah, but that's what you said when email first came out, or buying on Amazon.
*  I know my mom ...
*  Or voicemails.
*  Remember when he would get mad at you if you left a fucking voice?
*  Don't you fucking text message me, Joe Rogan.
*  Nobody fucking voicemails me no more.
*  But the text messages, you would get so mad.
*  Remember?
*  He still does, kind of.
*  I just erase.
*  If you still text message me, it depends what day, but that's ...
*  I like text messages.
*  That's just people I just erase.
*  I don't even look at the message.
*  Well, if I don't recognize the number, you just get erased.
*  Here's the problem, Joey.
*  The problem is you're awesome.
*  There's a lot of people that want to talk to you.
*  That's the problem.
*  And send you cool pictures.
*  No.
*  If you want to talk to me ... If you know me that well, you'll fucking call me.
*  I don't want to text with nobody.
*  I feel like the thing that everybody worries about is using their phone too much.
*  That's almost the number one thing everybody worries about.
*  Because if you didn't worry about using your phone too much, you'd say, oh, I just need
*  something I can text with and answer emails.
*  And occasionally look up something on Google.
*  That's it.
*  But you're addicted to your goddamn phone, so you're going to be Instagramming and Snapchatting
*  and TikToking.
*  I don't do any of that shit.
*  I don't do any of that shit.
*  You don't TikTok?
*  Fuck no.
*  It's against the law, bitch.
*  It's against the law, bitch.
*  It's against the law.
*  Joey, you should TikTok.
*  You're missing a whole corner of your market.
*  Do you TikTok?
*  Don't I?
*  Oh, man.
*  No, I've never TikToked.
*  But I'm saying you should TikTok.
*  Listen, I'm just a manager here.
*  My first TikTok video?
*  I'm not trying to play quarterback.
*  I'm trying to manage this team.
*  Joey, TikTok.
*  No, it's against the law.
*  You with fucking ... Let me tell you something.
*  There was a moment in the main room.
*  I don't know if you remember this, but this was like many years ago.
*  We're talking about like, fuck, I'm going to be TikToking.
*  We're talking about like 2001 maybe, maybe around then, maybe 2000.
*  There was no one in the main room.
*  You're on stage and you had Danny play Black Sabbath, Warpig.
*  I took my shirt off.
*  Do you remember that?
*  Yeah.
*  Do you remember?
*  You had Danny play Warpig and you took your shirt off.
*  That was 15 fucking years ago.
*  And you were singing into the microphone and we were like, yes!
*  Because it was so ... There was no audience.
*  No, there was 10 people.
*  Yeah.
*  There was 10 people, but there was also 10 comedians.
*  So there was 20 people in the audience in the main room.
*  10 of them were just audience members.
*  And then Joey's on stage.
*  He gets the spotlight on him and he's fucking singing at the ... Not lip syncing.
*  He's fucking singing at the top of his lungs to Warpigs.
*  And we're all like, yes!
*  It was what the comedy store is.
*  It was the madness.
*  It was sink or swim.
*  It was chaos.
*  It was there's 10 people in the audience.
*  What are you going to do, Jose Diaz?
*  What are you going to do?
*  Fucking hell.
*  You took your fucking shirt off and you started singing into the microphone full clip.
*  And we were cheering.
*  The audience was cheering because we recognized that you did something fun.
*  You did something special.
*  You took a moment.
*  A fucking 1245 spot in the main room on whatever night it was.
*  I don't remember.
*  It was only weekends back in those days.
*  The main room was only open on weekends.
*  So it had to be ...
*  Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.
*  Yeah.
*  It was most likely Friday or Saturday.
*  But it was late.
*  Everybody was gone.
*  And you just took control of this moment in this way that I'm never going to forget.
*  Because it was positive.
*  It was exciting.
*  And it made me realize what part of what live comedy is.
*  It's not just like set up punch line.
*  There's moments where you capture these moments.
*  You just knew how to grab a hold of that fucking wave and ride it.
*  You were just ...
*  It's a rogue in three years.
*  You were just riding it.
*  I've been obsessed.
*  Especially when I started watching YouTube.
*  Why YouTube?
*  I got into comedy and I followed comedy.
*  But then I looked at it differently.
*  When YouTube hit, I started studying singers.
*  I started studying singers to really learn how to really get my message across.
*  So I started with Robert Plant.
*  Nobody gets the message across like Robert Plant when he's singing Since I've Been Loving
*  You.
*  You have to study the great singers.
*  I studied the singer from Bad Company, his body movements.
*  Then I studied the singer from Leonard Skinner.
*  So I copied.
*  I stole Leonard Skinner's ... That dude, whatever his name was.
*  Can you see Joey Diaz on stage?
*  I'm just faking it.
*  I stole Leonard Skinner's singer's persona on stage.
*  The persona is that walk that he makes in Oakland in the 77.
*  The walk of James Brown onto Africa with the cape.
*  With ... They took the cape off.
*  Me and you laughed about it.
*  Once you take that side of music and you mix it with what we're trying to do and implement
*  it at the comedy store is when your life really explodes as a comedian.
*  Kenison touched into it.
*  This Oakland Coliseum?
*  You touched into it.
*  Yes.
*  Look at him.
*  That show's amazing.
*  He doesn't give a fuck.
*  You cannot give a fuck.
*  I studied what just a couple of singers have, this Joe Rogan, that you could tell what they're
*  singing about by looking at their body.
*  Robert Plant, since I've been loving you, live from the garden, his fucking body language
*  is superb.
*  Nobody's body language was better on stage than fucking Robert Plant.
*  Mick Jagger did his thing.
*  Selling you what three guys behind you are playing is a gift that I also wanted it to
*  happen to.
*  That's why I kind of liked Josh's idea.
*  If you didn't do it, you missed out as a comic.
*  Can you imagine what would have happened if ...
*  I said no to it for months and I did it.
*  It was the worst anxiety attack I ever got, but it was worth doing it one time, Joe Rogan.
*  What were you going to say?
*  I'm sorry to interrupt you.
*  Can you imagine if Leonard Skinner didn't crash on that plane?
*  We would have had a complete different world today.
*  The outlaws would have been huge.
*  Because Leonard Skinner was already blowing Ted Nugent out of the water on tour on that
*  tour.
*  It was well known.
*  Those songs were so good.
*  I Know a Little, I Know a Little About Love, Baby I Can Guess the Rest.
*  You have no idea.
*  You have no idea.
*  Dude, to this day, man, when I do my kickboxing workouts, nine out of 10 times, I put a Leonard
*  Skinner ...
*  It gets you angry.
*  Yeah, I put it on a playlist.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just, they weren't supposed to be that good.
*  They're from Florida.
*  For real.
*  They were.
*  That's the story of Leonard Skinner.
*  They're not supposed to be that good.
*  Ronnie Van Zandt, all those guys, they're from Florida.
*  They were powerful, though.
*  Bro, in a weird way.
*  They would rehearse their riffs, right?
*  Eddie Bravo was explaining to me the difference between some ... Some people have riffs where
*  they just go off.
*  Some guys just shred.
*  Some guys have riffs where the whole riff is this really calculated solo.
*  It's not as simple as a guy just fucking ... For the crowd.
*  This guy has got a whole ... When they did ... If they did Freebird, that one guitar
*  solo from Freebird ...
*  You've got to watch it.
*  You've got to watch it to just kill you.
*  Might be the greatest guitar solo of all time.
*  It was so polished because it's a crazy solo.
*  Because they did that solo over and over and over and over and over again.
*  Fuck it was good, man.
*  When he hits the leap, when he leaps in the air and slams down on the guitar ...
*  This kid here is a bad motherfucking ... Look at them.
*  You know who else had to play for the Arman brothers?
*  Fuck yeah they did.
*  With Dicky Betts and motherfucking Arman.
*  This here is beautiful.
*  I study this.
*  I study him.
*  Look at him.
*  He just spit.
*  He just fucking spit.
*  Joey, every time I used to have to do Kevin and Bean, I would do Kevin and Bean a lot.
*  There was only like LA radio station that I would do.
*  You'd have to get up really early in the morning if you wanted to get there by 7.
*  So I'd have to leave my house like 5 in the morning.
*  So it was like fucking dark out, right?
*  And I would smoke a joint in my driveway and I would play Midnight Rider.
*  I played the Arman brothers Midnight Rider.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah, I got to see the Arman brothers a few times.
*  Did you really?
*  Where?
*  Columbus, Ohio.
*  God damn.
*  What were they doing?
*  They used to do a tour with I believe like Blues Traveler or somebody like that.
*  There was a few of those jam band type bands.
*  I forget what the tour used to be called.
*  Dude, we had Rob Lowe here on the other day.
*  I saw that.
*  I didn't watch the whole podcast.
*  It was amazing.
*  It made me stop and think about some of the shit that I forgot that was awesome.
*  When you're hanging out with someone like Rob Lowe, you start thinking about other shit
*  that was awesome back when you first found out about him.
*  He's amazing.
*  It's a nice fucking guy.
*  Remember him in Austin Powers?
*  But he's like a really nice guy in real life.
*  Like you meet him.
*  He's everything you would hope he'd be.
*  He's really charming, really smart, really friendly.
*  He's good on Instagram too.
*  Like his live little videos and stuff he makes.
*  He's super legit.
*  He's a good guy.
*  Like a really nice guy.
*  I'm happy to know him.
*  It was fun talking to him.
*  But at a certain point in time when you're talking to someone that's that famous, it
*  does weird you out.
*  You're like, you're Rob Lowe.
*  This is so weird.
*  You just feel so strange.
*  So that's it, dog?
*  We're leaving?
*  Yeah, I think we have to.
*  This is the thing.
*  Is any bravo staying?
*  I don't know.
*  He'll come.
*  Well, I'll get out of here.
*  There's the tax thing.
*  There's the crime thing.
*  There's the looting thing.
*  There's no ability to work for too many people thing.
*  No school.
*  KSO.
*  The restriction.
*  KSO.
*  The restriction.
*  Barbecues.
*  Shout out to Hoggly Woggly's in Van Nuys though.
*  You ever eat at Hoggly Woggly's?
*  Fuck you.
*  You have money at times.
*  Yeah, they can hang you with anybody on the planet.
*  I don't give a fuck what anybody says.
*  I've eaten amazing barbecue in Austin, in Houston, in Dallas, in Nashville.
*  They have great barbecue.
*  Don't get me wrong, but Hoggly Woggly's in Van Nuys can hang with all them bitches.
*  People just don't know.
*  That's an old school joint.
*  That place has been around forever.
*  Next to that nasty strip club.
*  Bob Marley.
*  I had to shoot a movie there one night.
*  I was so fucking embarrassed.
*  There's a bunch of nasty strip clubs down there.
*  A sag low budget there.
*  One night.
*  What's up with you?
*  Why you giving me weird looks all night today?
*  You don't love me no more?
*  What?
*  No.
*  I was just thinking of barbecue and strip clubs.
*  Oh, okay.
*  I think that's where the fucking spikes coming from.
*  I'm talking about the massage parlors and everything's closed and strip clubs and stuff.
*  They're having Airbnb sex parties.
*  I guess that's the new thing.
*  Oh, great.
*  That's where the fucking spikes coming from.
*  I told about you two weeks ago when I went to CVS and I saw a white guy and a hot African
*  American chick having an argument outside of CVS at 920 in the morning.
*  He was a little chubby and they were having some type of loud discussion.
*  I went and I got my medication.
*  When I walked out, he's yelling at her, I want my wallet back, you fucking bitch.
*  Why do you think of me?
*  Because you're always talking about all those dirty bitches up in Van Nuys and shit.
*  So this is how bad it is where I live now.
*  So this is my CVS.
*  This is the main one I've been going to for 10 years.
*  And also when I walk out, I walk towards my car but I hear him go, I want my fucking wallet
*  back, you fucking bitch.
*  And she's like, I didn't take your wallet.
*  And what are you going to do?
*  Call the police and tell them what?
*  I sucked your dick.
*  Is that not a wedding ring around your hand?
*  And he goes, bitch, I don't give a fuck if it's a wedding ring.
*  Give him my fucking wallet.
*  And he hauls off and smacks the decks like fucking name or knockout in the UFC.
*  This is way better than anything you've ever seen.
*  The fucking pimp was down the block.
*  He took off on his fucking car.
*  The wallet fell out of her bra.
*  I didn't have a piece.
*  So I got in my car and took off because there's a lot of shooting in North Hollywood lately.
*  Two days fucking later, I'm at the office.
*  I go, let me go check on the office, get some shit out of there.
*  I go down the block.
*  I go down fucking whatever and I hook on Lancashire.
*  I'm stuck by the train station.
*  I'm the third car in the inside lane.
*  So I'm going south down Lancashire.
*  Okay?
*  I'm about to hit Magnolia, the federal, all that stuff.
*  But I'm sitting right there across from the train station.
*  And all of a sudden, out of the left of my eye, I see this commotion and I see this woman
*  looking up and all of a sudden I see an axe handle or something hit her.
*  And she goes down into the street and it's a white guy with a vest on just hitting people
*  with axe handles.
*  And they're going down one by one.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  I see a chubby guy running across the street and fucking he starts chasing the chubby guy.
*  Traffic is beeping.
*  Beep, beep, beep.
*  It's 3.30 in the afternoon.
*  And all of a sudden I go, this is my chance to be a fucking hero.
*  I hook a U-turn and I'm going to shoot down the street and catch him at the end and hit
*  him with my car.
*  It's been years since I hit a motherfucker with my car.
*  When I get to the corner, I hit the fucking left.
*  The guy sees me.
*  He dropped the axe handle already.
*  He sees me and he runs left instead of right.
*  If he would have ran right, I would have just hit him with the car and kept going.
*  It would have been an accident.
*  I didn't see him.
*  He committed a crime.
*  He dropped the axe handle and the guy was on the floor and his head was bleeding.
*  And then the guy ran back to the train station to get some more.
*  What is happening?
*  That's why I'm leaving, dog.
*  Fucking Lankershin, man.
*  Lankershin is fucking nuts.
*  My girl calls me.
*  My dog, she's married.
*  She's my buddy.
*  I had a rough day on the set.
*  Can I talk to you?
*  I go, I'll meet you behind the wire like I usually meet you.
*  Let's smoke a number.
*  We socially distance.
*  She sits in her car and I sit in my car and she tells me about her day on the set.
*  And it's 10 after 9 because I got to catch it before Mercy goes to sleep.
*  So I meet her like a quarter to 9.
*  We're talking and all of a sudden you hear, bah, bah, bah.
*  And then you hear, bah, bah, right behind that.
*  And we're like, did you fucking hear that?
*  That was right on the fucking corner.
*  I go home, my wife goes, thank God you're home.
*  She goes, it's all over the place.
*  There was a shooting at Magnolia Lankershin.
*  She goes to drive by and then the guy they shot, that shot twice.
*  That chicken place is there.
*  There's a chicken place.
*  Hot chicken.
*  Hot chicken.
*  Hot, Dave's hot chicken.
*  Yeah, dog.
*  It's not bueno by me, dog.
*  It's not bueno by a lot of people.
*  The axe handle just came out of nowhere and hit this lady in the head?
*  I was sitting there minding my own business.
*  This guy came out and started hitting people with an axe handle.
*  So it's not bueno.
*  You're seeing more.
*  I see, I go to Burbank a lot and I go down to Magnolia.
*  They've been saying that about New York too.
*  Random people get sucker punched.
*  New York and Chicago are both really bad right now.
*  Valley Village Park.
*  A guy was walking this dog at 2 in the morning.
*  Four identified men jumped out of a car and threw a beating on him.
*  For no reason.
*  I don't want what's in Seattle and Portland to come down here and catch.
*  My wife had to go downtown the other day to send money and she goes downtown.
*  It's just horrible.
*  It's already horrible to begin with but it's nightmare now.
*  You have stayed up here and up there.
*  Your final conclusion is to get in the car one day next week, I've told you, and just
*  go say your goodbyes to the economy.
*  You don't have to bring nobody.
*  Put your hand on the wall, make a left on Louisiana and then pick a street and make
*  a left so you can make another left to get on the 101 and make a mental projection of
*  when this will come back.
*  But you know what?
*  Everybody wanted the zombie apocalypse.
*  You got it bitch.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  You want everybody, I'm a zombie.
*  It's pretty class.
*  Everybody wanted society to burn.
*  So many people wanted society to burn.
*  I just don't think they expected it to burn this way.
*  They just didn't want the current system to be in place.
*  They wanted a more equitable system.
*  This is what happens when there's a breakdown.
*  When there's a breakdown we go back to who we were just a few thousand years ago.
*  This is why it's so important for civilization to be maintained.
*  because it helps rich people protect their money and helps people feel safe.
*  It helps everybody grow.
*  You're in a bad state if you've got violence everywhere because people can adapt to whatever
*  state they're in.
*  If they just become accustomed to having violence all the time everywhere, it's going to be
*  a much more dangerous place with the same people, same people living in it and two years
*  later it's a far more dangerous place.
*  For whatever reason, whatever causes people to lean one way or another like that, that's
*  not a good sign.
*  That's a sign of a very shaky civilization.
*  I think that we can lean one way or the other here.
*  We can either lean to where we fight more and there's more violence, more chaos, more
*  destruction, more people angry or if we can calm the fuck down and figure out a way to
*  work through shit together as human beings.
*  We're the same people that lived in this planet two years ago when everything was amazing.
*  We're the same people.
*  Yeah, there was always problems on this planet but when here you are two years later, it's
*  the same human beings.
*  We're just confronted with a problem we didn't expect and we didn't do a good job hitting
*  it and we fucked it up.
*  We have to figure out how to do it right but we have to also figure out how to maintain
*  the goddamn economy.
*  You have to have both.
*  You can't just have one thing.
*  You have to figure out a way where people can work in a safe way.
*  It's possible.
*  It's got to be possible.
*  What would you do different than Garth Sider or Gavin Newsom?
*  I am a moron.
*  What would you do different?
*  I'm not the guy that you would come to that's going to tell you how to run a city but I
*  would say you have to realize there's a ratio and there's a ratio of like if people hit
*  a certain amount of poverty and despair, they will the COVID.
*  If they hit a certain amount of despair and unemployment, there's a statistic.
*  You could actually find out like they've done studies.
*  You see it's a correlation between the amount of suicides, the amount of drug addicts, the
*  amount of people who commit crime.
*  They're all connected.
*  People have no choice.
*  They have no way out and that's what a lot of this is.
*  So we had they focused on one kind of life loss and that's the life loss loss of the
*  disease.
*  They didn't focus on the life loss loss to the economy collapsing or to people being
*  unable to pay for their bills and get depressed or suicidal or drug addicts.
*  They didn't factor that too.
*  You have to factor all that shit in.
*  They didn't do that.
*  They only factored the one thing which was you don't want people to die of the disease.
*  How do we make sure that the hospitals aren't overstaffed?
*  How do we make sure that people can work or overloaded rather?
*  How do we make sure that people can work safely?
*  And they didn't do a good job of that.
*  But nobody did.
*  Nobody in America did.
*  We never were prepared for something like this.
*  No, they weren't prepared.
*  They had no idea.
*  How could they?
*  We were not prepared and that's why you can't point a finger at anybody.
*  And I'm not apologizing for them either because there's probably somebody like Bill Gates
*  or someone like that who saw it coming a while ago and he would have done a much better
*  job of if you put him in charge of setting something like that up and protecting people
*  from pandemics and this is how much money you need to hit any sort of problem if it
*  happens.
*  If you don't, you're not going to be able to contain it.
*  If you don't contain it, it's going to spread.
*  You're like this is an investment that you have to make.
*  If you like laid it out to people in that way, who fucking knows man?
*  That shit might work.
*  It might have worked.
*  They might have been able to, if not prevent this, maybe slow it down.
*  But even New Zealand just has new cases.
*  New Zealand had no cases for a hundred days and now they have cases.
*  Really?
*  I just read they didn't.
*  I believe it's today.
*  I believe today they found some new cases.
*  Still.
*  You know this shit is crazy contagious.
*  It's crazy contagious.
*  It's weird.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Four new cases.
*  Shout out to Dana White for the bubble.
*  He came up with it.
*  Oh shit.
*  How'd he get there?
*  The MBA is working on it.
*  Now I don't think football is going to work.
*  It's crazy.
*  And that's going to devastate the college.
*  Who ever would have saw this coming seven months ago?
*  Nobody.
*  Nobody saw this coming.
*  Crazy.
*  Nobody saw this coming.
*  This is so tense.
*  Have you noticed?
*  Everyone's so tense.
*  It's a huge reset though.
*  I mean it's going to be interesting to see what's on the other side of this reset.
*  It might be more positive.
*  It might be not.
*  I feel like whenever things are really bad like you know with riots or with looting or
*  with craziness I feel like at the other end of it people usually take a deep breath and
*  they try to figure out okay what's the solution.
*  It's getting through the crazy part when people want to smash windows and burn things and
*  you get if we can get through that and get to the point where rational people from both
*  sides are talking.
*  The problem is a lot of other people have jumped in that aren't rational and they want
*  it all to burn down and you know their life's not so great anyway so they'd be happy to
*  set this federal building on fire.
*  Fuck you.
*  My dad hates me.
*  Fuck you.
*  You know there's a lot of that out there.
*  You got to be real careful with like who you give a license to light a building on fire.
*  Like who are they doing it on behalf?
*  Is that the wisest way to handle our resources?
*  Wouldn't it be better if we just like chanted, sang songs, maybe like stated our argument?
*  No.
*  So many people want to light things on fire.
*  Why?
*  Because they become a part of any like if you have a if you have a like a legitimate
*  cause that's a really good cause but a bunch of idiots jump in and they start fucking it
*  up like that's what happens with people.
*  If you just have a cause where anybody can join and it's one of the most pivotal things
*  it's on the news every day and everyone every day is fixated on it.
*  Of course you're going to get attention whores in there.
*  There's attention whores in every single walk of life.
*  You're going to get attention whores as activists.
*  There's going to be some activists that ruin it for all the other ones.
*  The other ones that were out there really just want things to change.
*  They're really tired of people getting shot by cops.
*  They're really tired of injustice.
*  They really are.
*  And then there's people that are crazy.
*  They want to hit people with bike locks like buildings on fire.
*  They're there too.
*  That's a problem.
*  The problem is we're all individuals.
*  Whenever we jump into groups like that based on some sort of ideology there's going to
*  be people on your team that you're not going to agree with.
*  You're stuck with their decisions.
*  You're stuck with what they do.
*  And then everybody thinks they're fucking heels in.
*  Everybody wants to be the left wing or right wing.
*  You're the winners or the against us.
*  You're red or blue.
*  Come on son.
*  It's like message board 101.
*  It's dumb.
*  There's always a couple people you're like alright.
*  It's dumb.
*  There should be no president.
*  There should be a bunch of people that are in charge of different jobs.
*  There should be like the president of finance, the president of war, the president of agriculture
*  the president of the environment.
*  Someone who only knows that one discipline.
*  Do you think Trump really has any idea what the fuck they're doing when they're fracking?
*  Do you think he's paying attention to what happens to people's water wells?
*  Their toilet bowls on fire.
*  No one knows why.
*  Come on man.
*  Can you imagine if you lived in one of those fracking places and you took a shit and it
*  was awful.
*  So you lit a match and you threw it into your bowl hoping you would kill some of the smell
*  of your horrible shit.
*  And then the match hits the bowl and lights on fire because your water's flammable because
*  they're fracking.
*  That's real.
*  That's totally possible.
*  Do you think Trump knows about that?
*  There's no way he knows about that.
*  He's got a hundred different hotels with his name on them.
*  They have giant gold letters like that's what I like.
*  That's what I'm looking for.
*  He's not paying attention to what's happening to people that are fracking.
*  He has no interest.
*  No one can.
*  You can only think of so many things man.
*  Is fracking what caused that earthquake in North Carolina?
*  It's causing earthquakes everywhere.
*  The number of earthquakes since fracking.
*  Before I talk shit, let's use bro science.
*  Let's find out what percentage of increase in earthquake activity.
*  Pretty much drilling for oil pretty much.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's basically they're drilling into it's a more complicated way of drilling.
*  But through this, they've liberated so much oil that we're not as dependent, if we are
*  dependent anymore, on international oil.
*  They've been able to suck a lot of it out of the ground.
*  But for people that live there, it's horrific.
*  There's a guy named, is it Josh Fox who has that book Gasland or a documentary Gasland?
*  I believe that's his name.
*  He's been on here before.
*  What's that?
*  This article about it, which this is from Inside Science from maybe a year.
*  What does that say there?
*  I didn't highlight it.
*  It's just weirdly highlighted already.
*  Even in Western Canada, only about one in 300 fracking operations causes earthquakes.
*  Oh, no big deal.
*  300.
*  Large enough for a person to feel.
*  In North America at the moment.
*  Imagine how funny that is.
*  Hey, man, seriously, we only cause one earthquake for every 300.
*  We're changing the earth.
*  Only one out of 300.
*  They don't tell you how many fracking operations they have.
*  What if they have like 300 a day across 3000 different holes in the ground?
*  Which seems like that makes actual sense.
*  It's probably something high like that.
*  Yeah, dude, you know, people have these ranches out in these places and then they have these
*  things set up on these ranches where they'll frack and dig into the ground.
*  Good luck if you have like a water source that's connected to that apparently.
*  And sometimes the gas gets out of the ground, it fucks up the air quality.
*  Bro, that gets dark.
*  They aren't just small quakes.
*  Although fracturing related earthquakes are chronic, they were thought to be minor, but
*  new research is showing they can be quite large and damaging.
*  The focus of the study of a 5.7 magnitude quake near Prague, Oklahoma damaged 14 homes
*  and other structures in the area.
*  Imagine you're in Prague, Oklahoma.
*  He's like, at least I can just sit on the porch and relax.
*  They're away from most folks.
*  And these fracking motherfuckers, they chewed up the ground under your house.
*  Like the government has to decide like how deep under your house is it still your house?
*  Like if you buy a plot of land and they drink your milkshake.
*  You remember that from that movie Let There Be Blood?
*  He's like, I drank your milkshake.
*  Remember that?
*  You remember what I'm talking about?
*  Dude, do you remember?
*  What am I going to see here again?
*  You're going to see me anytime you want.
*  Anytime.
*  Let's make scheduled times when we see each other.
*  You're going to do a comedy club down there and a podcast?
*  Most likely.
*  I'm definitely going to do a podcast.
*  Most likely I'm going to do a comedy club there too.
*  Why not?
*  It'll be fun for all of us.
*  What are you going to do?
*  You're going to have your first winner and you're going to be like, why the fuck am I
*  here?
*  Exactly.
*  So this is Daniel Day Lewis explaining to this guy how he drinks his milkshake.
*  He's explaining to this guy how he puts his pipes underneath this dude's land and he drinks
*  his milkshake and nothing you can do about it.
*  It's like it's weird.
*  I don't know how far under your house.
*  You got that Motion Plus shit still on your TVs guys.
*  That setting that makes it look like a soap opera.
*  Both of your TVs have that where it stabilizes the shake of a natural camera so now it looks
*  like a soap opera.
*  YouTube?
*  On YouTube?
*  No, your TV settings on both of these TVs have your Motion Plus turned on.
*  Do you notice that?
*  No, I've never widely watched videos.
*  It looks normal to me.
*  Really?
*  It looks like a soap opera to you?
*  Yeah, it's got that creepy look where it looks like there's no jiggle in the camera and everyone
*  is like there's just tripods everywhere.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I would have never noticed if you didn't point it out.
*  I know what you're talking about but I don't see it.
*  Oh, I see it.
*  Huh.
*  Interesting.
*  I hate it so much.
*  That is the nerdiest video talk ever.
*  It's one of the worst things ever, man.
*  It drives me crazy.
*  I hate it so much.
*  I can't even notice it.
*  It's like you know how most TV shows have like a little, like you're holding a camera,
*  like a realistic kind of like breathing of somebody filming it.
*  When the Motion Plus fixes all that it makes it so it looks like it's just on a tripod
*  and somebody hit record and they're recording somebody sitting there.
*  It's got this soap opera effect.
*  So it just looks like a cheap camera.
*  Most TVs have it turned on to begin with because TV companies think that looks better and people
*  want that but when I see it I get panicky.
*  No shit, that's so weird.
*  I've never even heard of that.
*  I have heard of it but I never thought of it.
*  Auto Motion Plus is a motion smoothing feature that eliminates ghosting and blurring that
*  occurs from fast moving images.
*  It looks great on live TV like sporting events or parades which are filmed at 30 frames per
*  second.
*  That's from Samsung saying that bullshit.
*  Maybe it's just better for sports though.
*  Maybe it actually is better for sports.
*  I mean because most sports are not handheld.
*  It's like overhead stuff.
*  But does it affect how it looks when things are moving fast?
*  Like if people are sprinting or something?
*  Probably because there's no jiggle to it.
*  But it already doesn't have jiggle to begin with so it's sure.
*  So would it be better to do it that way with movies but the way with the motion shit with
*  like fights and things like that?
*  Fights probably not but like football and baseball or something like that.
*  Something that's stationary cameras for the most part.
*  I didn't know that.
*  You know that?
*  Kids' god damn video dork.
*  Let me ask you something.
*  Ask me.
*  You calling the fights this week?
*  Yes I am.
*  Alright.
*  I'm very excited.
*  Vegas?
*  The bubble?
*  Yeah.
*  This is a crazy fight man.
*  The trilogy.
*  Daniel Cormier and Stipe Miočić.
*  So you get tested Friday and then?
*  Boy I got tested today.
*  Is that Curtis?
*  And I'm going to get tested again.
*  Probably like I'll test myself on Thursday too.
*  Taking a shit load of vitamins.
*  I don't want to miss this.
*  Vitamin D?
*  Yeah.
*  Hitting that sauna.
*  Keeping away from people.
*  Wearing a mask.
*  That's a big fight man.
*  It's a real big fight.
*  Hey when you get those hot sauna things do you have somebody babysitting in the outside?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Is somebody sitting in the outside.
*  You just be like hey check on me every 10 minutes.
*  I might.
*  Are you scared of passing out or something like that?
*  Is that a thing?
*  Who are you talking to?
*  No?
*  Who are you talking to?
*  How dare you?
*  That's what I worry about.
*  My will is too strong.
*  You'll be hallucinating next thing you're going to wake up.
*  You're going to be baking.
*  No.
*  It's not that bad dude.
*  180 degrees.
*  Legitimately it sounds hot.
*  But once you get accustomed to it because I've been doing it for months and months.
*  Like I started out I would do like 150 or 160, 170 and then I went too high.
*  I got way over like 220. I was in like the 220s. It was too hot. I get I was cooking
*  I come out my throat would hurt. I'm like that's stupid Laird Hamilton's a freaking nature
*  I don't know what's what the fuck's flowing through that guy's veins. He's got some fucking mercury flowing through his veins
*  But then I got to about 180 180 is like tolerable
*  But if it's it's a struggle like if you do 180 for a half an hour
*  Whoo, those last five minutes are rough. You want to get the fuck out of there?
*  It's a little dance with your mind, you know, you're telling you're telling your body who the fuck is in charge here
*  Sit down and just deal with it. Just breathe in you have five minutes
*  How you gonna get through this you gonna get through through breathing you want to listen to a book?
*  To sit the fuck down and deal with it. It's good. I like it that guy
*  He's out. He's a freak Laird Hamilton wears oven mitts and he chank
*  He cranks that shit up to 250 degrees and rides an air dyne bike
*  I
*  Smell
*  Bro, he smells awesome. It smells like success. It smells like a fucking man
*  Yeah, he's a
*  He's a freak
*  Crazy surfer man like some of the surfing shit you watch him and he's just dedicated to like continuing that lifestyle
*  Keeping his body fit like deep into his 50s. I think he's like 55
*  dudes the savage
*  Going hard out there in this 250 degree sauna with a fucking air dyne bike inside of it
*  Very unusual dude, man. You mean you got to be someone really special to us
*  That your number one thing that you love to do is ride hundred foot waves
*  Number one thing you want to do is balance on the fucking tip of the
*  Ferocious nature of the ocean you're balancing on the waves themselves. You're inside
*  The mouth of the most ferocious aspect of the ocean the biggest waves before they break on the shore
*  And guys like him like look at this man
*  That you have to be a crazy person to want to do that look at that that's amazing
*  Put that those headphones on
*  And then of course that me for another four months that's like showing up with a line of coke and leaving me alone
*  Yeah, fuck you. I'm ready to start from scratch
*  I'm excited to do some Bob Gonzo shows and just fucking just do some creepy shit again
*  In the endurance, yeah, it'll take a little while. I'm not gonna lie to you. We're all gonna be a little fucking rusty
*  Do you have any recordings?
*  old ones
*  You should record your shows on your phone from now on
*  It's not hard. Yeah, that's great. That way you can always go back and you always know your material
*  Yeah, it helps some port what I was thinking five months ago
*  And what I'm thinking now is completely different. Oh, yeah for sure
*  But what I'm saying is you'll have bits you'll have your bits you have whatever
*  I don't ever want to say those bits again
*  Whatever I was saying in February, you didn't record it. You gotta record gives a fuck I do it's what I feel
*  You got to save it. We gotta talk about what's going on now
*  What happened the last five months the breakdowns what happened something had happened to your last five months?
*  You're gonna come back with some old bit. I'm gonna come back with gay Bob is my neighbor
*  What kind of comic would I be that's what the problem with comedy is I can't wait to watch a guy like you
*  You know who's gonna light that stage on fire first?
*  Oh bill burr. I'll merge at home with a new kid four months
*  You're never gonna see anything like that the first time. Oh, I can't wait
*  Gonna fucking you
*  Nobody's I got I'm gonna build bill burr out right now. Yeah, he's at home with two kids first time
*  You know hasn't done dick
*  Whatever great guy playing the drums in his basement. He's gonna come at this with a complete different outlook
*  He's gonna attack somebody you know somebody's gonna go down hard. Yeah, you know, there's guys that you know
*  Yeah, we're gonna go out there like fucking gangbusters, but I just gonna happen April
*  That's what I would say
*  April so they come up with some kind of a vaccine
*  Right now they're saying January, but they're saying
*  January and they're winking at you. Yeah, it's by the time everyone gets around getting it and everything
*  I'd say April also. Do you guys think they should let people work?
*  Depends what type of job they're doing. Yeah, if they social distance, you know what I love I'm a fat fuck. I don't go there
*  but
*  The burger joint
*  In and out social distancing that I just ate there the other day
*  Distance in those four feet. Do they make people wear masks inside their mask and gloves and they really try their best
*  But there's jobs that you just can I want to get my haircut done
*  For that that week that it was open. It was the I thought the safest I've ever been
*  You know, they're fucking the hair people right now. Isn't it true that California is the only state like is that true?
*  California is the only state that doesn't let hairdressers open
*  Yeah, is that true though? I retweeted that map. I didn't even check and they said that's killing they do it outside
*  You can't have a sink outside. You can't cut hair and windy outside shit
*  And then what happens when it gets dark gotta stop
*  Otherwise, you can stay open till 8 9 at night
*  House they can't do you know can't do a shield
*  So you have to have your hand through a shield?
*  Dip them in the water and then they spread them and then you have to have the thing, you know
*  Hey, listen, you're stopping the Vietnamese and fucking Orange County
*  Yeah, the ones that built those tunnels for the Mexicans. They don't fucking stop those Vietnamese some Orange County
*  They're opening shop. They don't give a fuck. There's been what about the dudes in Jersey?
*  They threw in jail. We're opening up the gym
*  They're hitting them with some crazy fines like fifteen thousand dollars a day they're gonna lose their license
*  Says you can get a haircut outside as of July 20th 29th
*  Yeah, but no one's doing that right but what?
*  In my friend's of the do hair out here
*  They said that they can't even like have you come to their house because if they find out the hair association they'll pull their license
*  The question though was is California the only state that bands
*  Doesn't hmm
*  Seems doesn't
*  But then again, right if you're if you're someone who's fucking you can make 600 bucks from the government or
*  You can take a risk of getting some disease. It might kill you to clean someone's nails
*  Yeah
*  But the problem is that from what I'm hearing is a lot of people are not getting any checks like though
*  They got one big one and then they haven't heard anything for months you can't call anybody you can't get anything
*  So it's like I have to pay rent. So what am I gonna do exactly? I do that. I feel you 100%
*  I don't have like when I look at this, there's almost a clear way out of this
*  Because I feel like if everybody just went back to work more masks
*  How much quicker with the disease spread?
*  People are working like they used to be working side by side with people just wearing masks. How much would it stop that? I
*  Don't know
*  What does that look like?
*  I mean is the only reason why there's not a fucking heat more dead bodies because we killed the economy
*  I don't know man. I'm too stupid. I like to think that's the way reason, you know, like it seems like that makes sense
*  My worry is that they like telling people what to do. That's my worry people like telling people what to do
*  They love it stay inside
*  Do this do that wear a red flag, you know wear a blue t-shirt
*  They'll say that people love getting people to comply with everything and if all of a sudden they have this power to keep you
*  So you comply with anything? Well, I didn't have to okay. I got lucky near today
*  But a lot of you did I go to parties? No, no, I go to the park
*  No to one do I need to go to a bar? Not really. Do I need to go to a restaurant?
*  I don't even like fucking sitting next to people before COVID
*  Okay, so you won't see me in a restaurant till fucking Sun Sun to narrow
*  You understand me there's things that are you know, if you're gonna stand out here with 40 people for a piece of chicken
*  You should be shot and hung and then shot again. There's just certain things, you know
*  I was very very very very very and you know this upset
*  about the stand up and
*  I pleaded with you not to go to Houston. I
*  Called Brendan as a man. I understand the need
*  To need money, but I don't understand the need there's only one Dave Chappelle
*  So everybody should stay home and mind their fucking business
*  Nobody needs to go on the fucking road because by a hit of us like you going on the road
*  We have a little power now. We all stay home. There's Colbert. It's time for you to close
*  People are fucking dying. Where were the rates the highest?
*  Arizona Texas, Florida what three comedy clubs are open
*  Arizona
*  Florida listen, I ain't point
*  Giving you a fucking fact. Okay, you never showed with me to not go to Houston. There was no please
*  No, I told you that Thursday. I said mind your fucking business and stay the fuck
*  Why you going to Texas? Why you going?
*  No comedy where you wear a mask you come in
*  I
*  Cancel the rest of my tour. This is terrible. I just got a blood test. I got my knees checked
*  Once Brendan and fucking the other guy got it that set you off a little bit
*  Oh, and you have children and you have a wife and you have responsibilities. Well, here's the big thing and you have yourself
*  Guests if I got you sick or you sick. Yes, Jamie sick or anybody working here that that would be
*  Please I thought you could do it
*  I'm like if the health department says you can do it and you know
*  They social distance and you wear a mask and you could do it
*  but then I got there Mike you probably can you probably can like four to five times or eight out of ten times or
*  12 out of 15 times
*  But you're gonna it's gonna get you it's gonna get you if you're in these large groups of people and everybody's laughing
*  Like what is better at spraying?
*  Part of this game
*  Is taking a picture with people? Yeah and answering a question, you know, it took away that alienation of it
*  So I'm done that I'm done there. I don't want six people in the green room
*  I don't need the way to come in. Yeah, I don't need the guy coming in
*  How much time do you want to do the music guy? I don't need any of their finding out now
*  We're doing all this stuff. We're doing all this stuff by the book. I won't do it. I'll do it at certain places
*  By the book needs to be examined like what but what by the book is my the book is I'm gonna sit in my fucking car
*  Three feet from the fucking door when I'm three minutes to go up. You're not on the fucking door
*  I go in I do the comedy and I go back in my fucking car in between shows and I take a ride
*  Then I come back at 1040
*  When everybody's seated and you do it again
*  You can't go in the fucking green room and more than because anything after three or four people we got it
*  It's like going to a fucking orgy. You got it. So now you're gonna go out there
*  I don't know about you
*  But when I fucking you know when I was a kid people tell me Joey give me the news not the weather
*  I spit when I talk so I don't want nobody ten feet
*  It's really 30 feet if you really think about the distance of 30.3
*  30 feet something fucking crazy
*  Look at my fucking lungs look at my stomach when I get excited and I'm fucking yelling I'm doing a fucking bit
*  Dentist drove my teeth, you know what I smelt what do you know what I smelt in my teeth to air
*  pubic fucking hairs
*  Fucking the stink in my teeth when they drill
*  When they drill your mouth and you smell your teeth burning and whatever's stuck in between there, you know
*  I mean, it's a fucking nightmare. So
*  I'm talking about that that that's my concern about stand-up comedy
*  We're all gonna get COVID eventually you're gonna get it. We're all gonna be strong enough. We're gonna survive. That's okay
*  My thing is the social uncertainty
*  the one show where somebody gets up and says fuck you and
*  Somebody throws a bottle and we have a problem. You know what we have too much of that going on right now. So for that I
*  Will not go on stage until everybody's settled
*  Everybody is happy. The vibe is better
*  Go on you go on your salvation right now in isolation
*  Is the internet and you go on the internet and you get off feeling even worse than what you felt like
*  When you went on it it's true you avoid the TV if you have it in any intelligence level right now
*  You have to avoid the TV and if you throw down lemon on or the other fucking cocksucker
*  It's even fucking worse
*  Don Lemon outside kick him in the lung if I see that
*  And Chris Cuomo crying what the fuck is wrong with you cocksucker
*  I used to like him then he started crying and shit like they got him and I had to stop watching all that nonsense
*  ABC News is not the most watched news. It's a fucking business. It's a business and they're there to petrify you
*  Yeah, so I turned all that shit off everything. I'm canceling Facebook pretty much
*  This is what you said is very important. Well, you just said it's very important. You know, the news is a business. It's a business
*  It's all over, you know, I'm done
*  I'm done if it was up to me Joe Rogan, I would have moved to Montana, you know
*  Why didn't you move to Montana?
*  Get out of California detox a little bit and let's talk
*  Let's talk. Let's talk. Okay, let's get a ranch. I say open up a club in Billings. I'm in that's a theater
*  slash
*  Tremendous comedy
*  Okay, let's call it
*  Hmm just for
*  Serb he knows who we're coming from a
*  Mini cult a mini comedy mini comedy mini call 60 man comedy guys who believe in comedy
*  That can be done bring your wives bring your Montana
*  Montana because two regular schools, right? Oh, we all abide certain certain comedy rules
*  No thieves, right? No King. No people fucking
*  I want to play me
*  When the movie came up he was too old for the movie
*  Good fucking movie that was great just to get in there is
*  Playing with your fingers
*  That's the end this podcast
*  Well, I hope you're wrong about April but whenever it is
*  Will will be more appreciative. I think can an alligator survive without eating. Yeah for a long time
*  I heard it can never die from starvation. Is that real? I don't know
*  I know they know that for sure crocodiles have gone without eating for a whole year
*  What's with the croc about question I somebody told me that I can't stop thinking about it solid question
*  Because what if they don't starve death they just shrink right and I also heard lobsters, but I heard that was fake
*  That lobsters don't have to eat. Oh
*  dude
*  Yeah, that makes sense if you until you like shrink if you don't have enough food you get down to like nothing right and then you're
*  Down to one cell. Wow, that's interesting, bro. It just shrink with cells
*  Only can be killed by starvation or accidents it says
*  Crocodiles have no recognized finite lifespan and said they just get bigger and bigger until they inevitably
*  They're inevitably killed out by starvation
*  Accidents or disease. This is the reason we don't see crocodiles the size of Boeing 747s in the wild
*  So if there was an unlimited amount of food there forever and no disease
*  We vaccinated crocodiles and gave an unlimited amount of food then there'd be dinosaurs
*  They're basically dinosaurs what didn't we figure that out the other day that crocodiles are as old as some dinosaurs
*  dinosaurs were like 65 million years
*  Crocodiles go back to like a hundred million years. Wasn't that what it was? So they're pre they're dinosaurs
*  Yeah, they're just still around just hungry dinosaurs. Have you seen an alligator in real life? Yeah, it's so confusing
*  It's like why is it right there and why is everybody not freaking out?
*  80 million years. So yeah, so that's 15 million years older than when the asteroid hit and killed everything
*  So they're fucking dinosaurs
*  Do I remember seeing one for the first time is it Lake Alice, it's in Gainesville, Florida
*  My dad was going to school in Gainesville. We were down there and
*  What's this lake you throw marshmallows in the water and alligators come and get it
*  I was like, this is the strangest shit in the world
*  There's a ten-foot lizard just ate a marshmallow in front of me and I'm not even worried about it
*  Like when in the world is a fucking giant dinosaur like feet in front of you and you're not freaking out
*  The croc crocodiles were too mean they became too dangerous and no one wanted him around but alligators look like crocodiles
*  But they're just chill enough that people don't freak out too much if they're around that was their trick
*  That's how they stayed alive. They just move slower move slower and didn't attack as much
*  But they're fucking everywhere man
*  If you live in Florida you get alligators in your yard all the time like people want to live in Florida like okay
*  Yeah, there's alligators out there
*  for the video of the day a baby alligator and a bobcat duking it out
*  I'm going viral secure. Oh my god. Look at that thing. Look at that cat. It gets it
*  It gets it oh for sure it gets it the big cats and like
*  Caimans down in oh my god bites them right in the head
*  but big cats like caimans that live down in the Everglades or not the Everglades to the
*  Amazon they
*  Those leopards eat or jaguars they crocodiles down there all the time. There's a whole bunch of videos of them
*  They jump in the water behind crocodiles and bite them in the head
*  Cats are the scariest
*  But a crocodile and are alligators that's a real live dinosaur just chilling at your golf course
*  Congratulations
*  Thank Godzilla
*  Versus more to our so we don't do for your birthday dog. Today's my birthday. So you know this is my celebration
*  This is it. We don't the wife you go now you jump up and down
*  We'll do something. Yeah, probably like that
*  I hope
*  I
*  Hope burger. Yeah, no, they're frozen Jesus Christ bad. I hop fucking pancakes
*  I went to that pancake place in Burbank. What a mistake. What which one petty shitty one
*  My god that is fucking that place is bad. That's not a good pancake was a place in Boulder
*  It's real pancakes the ones that are not uniform I don't like I'm not a big
*  I love pancakes for the five minutes. I'm eating and then afterwards I feel like shit for days
*  Yeah, I think McGriddle is enough. I don't that's enough
*  I love McGriddle. Yeah. Oh my god turn me
*  Remember they first came out you and Tate Fletcher. So
*  It's so delicious can't help yourself you don't care what's
*  You still eat the fish sandwiches you nasty fuck
*  I still do
*  Every time I go to McDonald's with my daughter
*  I'm like that cocksucker eats filet of fish sandwiches
*  I eat two or three of those filet of fish
*  You know your asshole smells like afterwards not fucking good
*  Well, don't look at it
*  But but you can't tell me that McGriddle doesn't taste delicious
*  Terrible
*  It's the worst thing I've ever tasted
*  Have you had one?
*  When they first came out
*  With the mystery meat and the cheese
*  Oh Jesus
*  And that fake syrupy
*  Spongy bread bun
*  It's good
*  I could do a fucking Egg McMuffin if I have to
*  I like Egg McMuffin
*  I like Egg McMuffin
*  But if I'm really tired I'm like fuck it
*  I get a McGriddle
*  I don't care
*  McGriddle? Yeah you can get sausage or bacon right?
*  You get a bacon McGriddle
*  McGriddle
*  They had that one sandwich that was the rib
*  McRib
*  They spray paint the bone in
*  Is that real?
*  They don't spray paint it
*  Whatever the fuck they do something
*  That's what I understand about the McRib
*  Why do they ever take it off the menu if people like it so much?
*  Because they limit it time only
*  They buy it cheap
*  It's like it's seasoned
*  It comes via Wu Han
*  We'll fucking bat on it
*  Okay I was hoping it was like
*  They can only buy a large amount of meat
*  They can't buy it all that frequently
*  It's permanent on the menu in Germany
*  And Luxembourg
*  So head over there
*  They don't like manipulation over there
*  Ficing down the menu all year?
*  What are you doing? You are manipulating people's desires?
*  I don't think so
*  They don't even allow Scientology in Germany
*  Good
*  They won't allow them
*  They are like excuse me? What are you saying?
*  You are saying that the guy who writes the science fiction books
*  Comes up with the best religion
*  And you don't want to pay taxes
*  That might be the worst German accent of all time
*  There's conspiracies about why it's not on the menu all the time
*  It's a deep debated topic
*  Probably because it fucking kills you
*  It probably kills you
*  They probably know that if they give it to people 40 days
*  They will just start dropping dead
*  They will just start dropping dead
*  So they will be like listen
*  Just give them 20 days of McRib
*  Problem solved
*  If they buy
*  If they buy 20 days of McRibs
*  Then they die 36 days
*  There's no way they can connect us
*  Once a month I get zapped into going to get a Happy Meal
*  Happy Meal?
*  Because of the toilets
*  My daughter, the fuck is wrong with you?
*  What is wrong with you?
*  I got to go in there
*  Now we drive
*  And they always give her the wrong toy anyway
*  What's the right toy?
*  The one that they advertise, you fuck
*  Not the one, whatever
*  I go there trying to get the fucking one
*  And they give me the other one
*  And then I got an A and an A B
*  So two weeks ago I had to go in there
*  With the mask on
*  And go, can I talk to somebody?
*  Listen, I got a daughter
*  The last two times you come in here
*  You advertise emoji
*  Why is this on TikTok?
*  What the fuck?
*  And the manager said let me help you out
*  And she gave me the toy I wanted
*  And my daughter was happy
*  But the last two times, I even tell them
*  She's a girl
*  Sometimes they ask you, is she a boy or is she a girl?
*  She came here for a certain fucking thing
*  And you gave her something else
*  That's misrepresentation
*  Misrepresentation
*  So I had to go in there and get fired up
*  And they finally
*  They're gonna do it all at once
*  Yeah, they tell you
*  Listen, don't ask me
*  Didn't they try to outlaw those some places?
*  They try to outlaw giving toys into happy meals
*  Because they're like, no, no, no
*  Kids like them too much
*  It's forcing kids to eat bad
*  Because they want that toy
*  I give her the apple slices
*  Listen, I grew up in a house
*  Where I wasn't allowed to eat fast food
*  Only in Miami
*  My cousins ate it
*  Chicken Delight.
*  I used to order that.
*  She would say, you're not gonna eat my rice and beans?
*  Not really.
*  And all of a sudden they'd be,
*  she go, I wonder who the fuck that is.
*  It's for me.
*  Don't cook tonight, call Chicken Delight.
*  Five dollars, three pieces of chicken,
*  some ruffle fries, a little piece of jelly.
*  In those days I was really wanting to be American,
*  so I dip my french fries in the jelly.
*  That's one of my gross days,
*  when I first came from Cuba.
*  Don't cook tonight, call Chicken Delight.
*  Joey, what is that Cuban place that you took me to,
*  the one that used to be near my house in Encino?
*  The one that's on Ventura?
*  Yeah, they're still there.
*  What's that place called?
*  I forget, there are three of them.
*  God damn it.
*  I don't go there, I go to Cochinito.
*  We ate there once and I had that garlic chicken
*  with the raw onions.
*  Tremendous.
*  Ooh. Tremendous.
*  That's our staple.
*  What is the name of that?
*  Versailles? Versailles.
*  Yes, I knew it.
*  Da da da.
*  I was just, just as you were pulling it up,
*  I feel like I saw it first.
*  We're gonna go after this or what?
*  I remember.
*  I'll go there, I'd love that place.
*  If they, does it show an image of that chicken
*  with the onions, with raw onions?
*  It's a garlic chicken with raw onions.
*  That's the pork.
*  And he was there with John Jock yesterday.
*  God damn, it's good.
*  That's it right there, that's it right there
*  with the plantains.
*  Woo!
*  There's something about Latin food, right?
*  Like there's almost like a, there's a pop to it.
*  That like other, like there's the spices and shit
*  for Cuban food.
*  Cuban food, like really like spicy Spanish food.
*  There's something about the pop of those ingredients,
*  you know?
*  With that fucking garlic chicken with the raw onions
*  and that sauce, that's like a lemon sauce
*  that they had, Joey?
*  Yeah.
*  Wasn't it?
*  Like a lemony garlic sauce?
*  Like garlic, yeah, yeah.
*  Garlic lemon.
*  God damn, that was good.
*  Kick in the door, wave in the four four.
*  All you heard was, Papa, don't hit me no more.
*  What's up, dawg?
*  Hey, you're touching my hand a little bit.
*  Cause I love you, I miss you.
*  I haven't seen you in three fucking months.
*  Listen, if we all move to a different place,
*  maybe we'll love each other more
*  and we'll get together in a specific spot.
*  I'm moving to Texas too, man.
*  I'm getting the fuck out of Los Angeles.
*  How long till you move?
*  When is your due date?
*  I might wait a while, you know,
*  and get their feet on.
*  People are really worried about taxes, Joey.
*  I know they are.
*  Cause they're talking about raising them up significantly.
*  Lowering the police and defunding the police
*  from the schools and trust me,
*  I hear this from my wife every night.
*  I get the fucking.
*  Yeah, cutting the education budget.
*  Cutting the education budget, no school all year.
*  It's crazy.
*  Parents don't wanna mix and match.
*  It's tough.
*  I just want a garage and a basement.
*  That's all I need.
*  It's just, I feel like.
*  23 years, Joe Rogan.
*  I did more than I thought I'd ever do.
*  You know what?
*  I was at the store at a different time
*  than Kennison and Dice.
*  And it was just as magical.
*  But sometimes I'd rather not be Willie Mays
*  and go play for the Mets.
*  If Willie Mays was smarty with it,
*  gone out with the San Francisco Giants.
*  That's exactly what I'm doing.
*  I'm not gonna do Tom Brady.
*  He just won six championships.
*  Now you wanna go to Tampa Bay and do what?
*  There's a time to say goodbye.
*  She used to say it best.
*  What's that lady we grew up on?
*  It's so nice we had this time together
*  just to have a laugh or sing a song.
*  I have no idea who this is the worst impression.
*  Kyle Burnett.
*  Oh.
*  And before you know it,
*  it's the time we have to say so long.
*  Yo, can I ask you this?
*  Have you adapted well?
*  Are you adapted?
*  Have you like? To what?
*  To do what? This is normal.
*  This is your new life now.
*  This is life.
*  This is what it is.
*  Don't stand up.
*  You're doing podcasts. I misstand up.
*  I'm pulling the podcast.
*  I'm ending the church the same way.
*  I wanna walk out like a man with my feet
*  instead of walk out on my knees.
*  I got some ideas.
*  But my plan right now is to leave,
*  quarantine for 10 days,
*  move into the house,
*  put my daughter in school,
*  shoot a couple days in the Sopranos,
*  and then you and I'll talk business.
*  Okay.
*  You and I will call
*  and we'll decide what we're gonna do.
*  If we go to Montana, Red Band,
*  it's gonna be colder than fuck.
*  It's cold as fuck.
*  But we're gonna print money
*  opening up a comedy club.
*  Brian, you need to learn how to chop wood.
*  I know how to.
*  I don't wanna, I ran away from all that life.
*  We go to Billings.
*  Mini cult.
*  We go, there's two or three places in Montana
*  that would welcome us,
*  welcome us with a tax break,
*  with the whole thing,
*  if we just opened up a comedy club in Montana.
*  People would love to see Brendan Shaw in Montana.
*  People would love to see Kilthong.
*  Hawaii's too easy and we gotta fight the alligators.
*  Probably Hawaii is, you couldn't even fly there.
*  Yeah.
*  Right now, if you fly there,
*  you have to wait for two weeks.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that shit goes to September 1st, doesn't it?
*  Something along those lines.
*  And I want Montana,
*  cause it's hard to get there.
*  It's a connecting flight.
*  Yeah, I got Utah.
*  That means.
*  Yeah, Montana's a pain in the ass to get to.
*  Utah too.
*  Keith's got a great club down there.
*  Montana's gonna weed out the week
*  and it's gonna make you stronger.
*  You're gonna be a stronger person, Brian.
*  What's Montana's weed laws?
*  Yeah, August 11th.
*  Reinstated beginning August 11th.
*  Mandatory 14 day quarantine has been,
*  partial inter-island quarantine reinstated.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, they're not fucking around in Florida,
*  or excuse me, in Hawaii.
*  They don't want people to get it.
*  Get on the island.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it makes sense.
*  Yep.
*  They've got, they can't get away from it.
*  You know?
*  It's not like, if they catch it on one of those islands
*  and it spreads through the whole fucking island.
*  Should they close borders of every state?
*  It's a good question, man.
*  If this, listen, per capita right now,
*  Arizona's the worst.
*  Is it?
*  I called the guy I kidnapped the other night
*  to check in with him.
*  Just to make sure, you know me, I'm a Christian.
*  He's so sweet.
*  I heard he was having a rough time,
*  so I called him to see if he needed anything.
*  And he told me he doesn't leave the house
*  because he's got his mom.
*  It's PTSD.
*  He takes care of his mom, so he's in Tucson.
*  Yeah, Arizona's a-
*  He said that per capita,
*  it's the worst spot in the world.
*  They got hit.
*  He's very, very scared.
*  So did you just find-
*  Anywhere there's migrant workers, they get hit.
*  Anywhere there's people that don't believe in mass,
*  they get hit.
*  A lot of churches, people that wanna go to church,
*  they don't give a fuck.
*  They start singing in church, they get hit.
*  It's like those are the people that get hit.
*  Churches, unfortunately, people when they say,
*  you can't ban houses of worship,
*  like, boy, that's a tough one.
*  Because everybody's yelling.
*  I listen, I wanna go to church.
*  But church is where your heart is anyway.
*  So enough with the-
*  Church is where your heart is.
*  But they need to make a solution.
*  So I understand you have to go and see and sing and dance.
*  But you know what, for right now,
*  what's going on right now,
*  I don't know what's in the Constitution.
*  I don't know what's in the Federation.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just saying that for right now,
*  if you wanna have the congregate,
*  anything over eight people, you're playing with fire.
*  Anything over six people, you're playing with fire.
*  But even then, unless you know who those-
*  They're living with you fine.
*  But if you don't know-
*  Italy got hit.
*  They should figure out a way to do it outside.
*  My friend who's a pastor in Ohio
*  does it outside every Sunday.
*  Totally can be done.
*  In a park.
*  They can do it.
*  You can do it outside until it gets really cold out.
*  Yeah, and then you're fucking cold, priest.
*  Then you gotta get a bonfire going.
*  Yeah, and then it's the forest.
*  Seven Jesus bonfire every Sunday.
*  Yeah, that sucks, right?
*  Say now they're wearing mittens on,
*  you're eight, like, fuck this, dad.
*  Come on.
*  Wait till the vaccine, dad.
*  I don't wanna go to church by the bonfire.
*  Montana, this is getting the fuck out of here.
*  I love you guys.
*  I love you too.
*  I love you, Red Band.
*  I love you, baby.
*  I love you with all my heart.
*  You guys came for my wedding.
*  I love you, baby.
*  We're family here.
*  This doesn't mean nothing.
*  For real, think about, I mean,
*  I hate to keep us going for a second here,
*  but think about how weird this has been,
*  like, doing these podcasts over these years.
*  That's changed all of our lives.
*  How weird it is, you just talk into a microphone,
*  just talk shit, and do it over and over
*  and over and over again, and people just enjoy it.
*  900 episodes.
*  What's your new thing gonna be after you do the church?
*  What are you gonna call it?
*  I do not know yet.
