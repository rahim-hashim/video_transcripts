# Joe Rogan Experience #2229 - Jeff Dye
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN7Xnj9uR1M)
*  I used to have a dog that had terrible, I mean, I don't have it.
*  I'm always traveling and also like I'm not real good with discipline of like someone
*  else, you know?
*  Like I don't know how to train a dog.
*  So I just let him do anything.
*  So I think it was hilarious.
*  He'd be like chewing on something.
*  I'm like, check that out.
*  They're like, he shouldn't do that.
*  I was like, eh, fuck it.
*  I liked the idea that he was wild.
*  It made me happy.
*  It's very bad though if your dog bites somebody.
*  Oh, he's always just humping stuff and like eating.
*  He was a Ridgeback.
*  Oh, Rhodesian Ridgeback?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh.
*  But in my mind, I'm like, well, why do I want to rain tyranny on this dog and be like, he
*  needs to sit.
*  He needs, I kind of liked that he was like this little psycho that would hump things
*  and that's fun, but you got to be able to control them.
*  I know I couldn't.
*  Yeah.
*  How old were you back then?
*  I was young, like 31 or something at the time.
*  Young.
*  It's not that young.
*  You're young to me, dude.
*  I didn't become an adult for a while.
*  For like six months ago.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  About four years, I think.
*  No, but that dog, I would open the door.
*  He would just dart and I was like, yeah, this dog is unhinged.
*  I let him wolf.
*  You liked it.
*  Yeah, I liked it.
*  It was crazy.
*  Yeah, I've had some crazy dogs, but it's like you got to train them.
*  They have to listen to you.
*  Well, I had a lot of pit bulls when I was younger.
*  Oh, nice.
*  They have to listen.
*  You look like a pit bull.
*  They have to have a sense that you're the boss.
*  You have to be kind and sweet and you love them, but you're the boss.
*  You have to train them.
*  I train my dog diligently.
*  I was like, treat, sit, stay, make them stay for five minutes and then give them a big
*  treat and hug them and kiss them.
*  You got to make sure they fucking listen.
*  Well, that was the problem is that I would literally, he would be doing something and
*  I'd be like, he doesn't respect me.
*  That's as simple as it was.
*  He saw me as a cool guy.
*  He was your friend.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So I would leave him with his dog trainer in Sherman Oaks and the dog trainer would
*  send me videos and he'd be like, look.
*  And I would think, look at me.
*  My money's gone to good.
*  Look at what my dog's doing.
*  He's doing a little turn.
*  But it's because he respected that guy.
*  And so then he would come back to my house.
*  He'd just piss on the couch while he's laying there.
*  And I'm going, wait, what was all that stuff he learned?
*  And he goes, my dog's looking at me going, not for you.
*  Yeah, you're my friend.
*  Yeah, you're the cool guy.
*  You're my fucking roommate, bro.
*  We were buds.
*  We're both dogs.
*  Which is a metaphor for my life, too.
*  I was the fun piss on the couch guy.
*  But at some point, you got to grow up and be disciplined.
*  You really do.
*  Yeah.
*  And you don't have as much fun.
*  But the fun that you have, you appreciate.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Yeah, because it's not out of control.
*  My dog that I have now is the first dog that I've ever had that was so easy to train.
*  It's like I didn't even train him.
*  And it's a golden?
*  Are they kind of dumb?
*  No, my dog's very smart.
*  What's the dumb breed?
*  They're just sweet.
*  They're sweet, so people think they're dumb.
*  But he understands words.
*  Like I'll say, not that door, dude.
*  Let's go in the side door.
*  And he turns around and goes towards the side door.
*  He gets it.
*  Like, he's a fucking smart dog.
*  But training him was like that.
*  Really?
*  Oh my god.
*  First of all, goldens have no resistance.
*  They don't want to fight.
*  They never growl at people.
*  If they bark, if they see something weird, they never bark at people.
*  They're just the sweetest dogs.
*  I love that.
*  They just want you to be their friend.
*  So I teach him to sit was like real easy.
*  It was like sit.
*  I push his butt down.
*  And then I give him a little treat.
*  And then I'd say sit.
*  And he just sit down.
*  Love it.
*  And I give him a treat.
*  And then next day, it was like sit.
*  He sat.
*  Pat him on the head.
*  Give him a kiss.
*  Now he just listens.
*  Which is also the metaphor for humans.
*  We like to have a little approval.
*  Like it's less of the treat and the pat on the head.
*  I made dad happy.
*  Yeah, they're the most like people.
*  Those dogs.
*  They're the most like people.
*  What's the dumb breed?
*  There's a lot of dumb breeds.
*  Sometimes I'll see like a Dalmatian and then I'll ask that one.
*  Poor little Carl.
*  Carl is about the brightest.
*  But his brain is the size of my thumb.
*  He doesn't have a big head.
*  They're cute though.
*  That's the thing.
*  I love the shit out of that dog.
*  He's so jacked too.
*  Look how jacked he is.
*  His little muscles.
*  He's in constant shape.
*  Well him and Marshall like go to war.
*  Like he just, when Marshall's here, like Carl gets so tired from playing with my dog.
*  My dog doesn't fight back so he just totally takes advantage of it.
*  Just throws himself at him like a torpedo.
*  But when it's over he like can't breathe.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  Because he was bred to not wrestle.
*  He's got no fucking nasal cavity.
*  It is a weird dog.
*  They used to be a wolf.
*  They look like aliens.
*  But it's so fucking weird that humans turned a wolf into that fucking thing.
*  I think it's our best invention.
*  It's a pretty cool job.
*  Not saying it's an ethical thing or a smart thing.
*  It's our best invention.
*  If you knew what you were doing to a wolf, it's kind of fucked up.
*  But it doesn't need to survive.
*  That thing's, yeah he's got Jamie, he's got us, he's in the safest place in America right
*  now.
*  Like when you see those ladies that carry him around in little purses, got a dog carrying
*  around with their purse.
*  That used to be a wolf.
*  That's wild.
*  They're trying to do that to us.
*  I know.
*  That's the problem.
*  Just keep your dogs.
*  Don't change me.
*  They want to do that to everybody.
*  If Kamala won we would have been one step closer to poodles.
*  Every day I was getting closer.
*  That's why I'm single too.
*  Just trying to hold on to any freedom I got.
*  You got to find someone that you jive with that gets you.
*  That's what's hard.
*  People want to change people.
*  Girls look at guys, they look at some guys like a project.
*  Like I know he doesn't want to settle down.
*  I know he doesn't want this.
*  But if I could just get him to start changing the way he dresses.
*  And then I'd get him to open the guard door for me like my hands don't work.
*  I know.
*  I'm still, I'm the Ridgeback.
*  We were just talking about.
*  Where I'm going, just let me be wild.
*  I'll spend like 24 hours with a woman and just enjoy every second of it.
*  I enjoy every, like all the affection, the door opening.
*  I enjoy these kind of things.
*  Taking care of someone, showing them how cool.
*  Do you open up the guard door?
*  Yeah I'll do that.
*  I like that.
*  I'll show them my life.
*  Hey these are my comedy buddies and watch me go kill on stage.
*  Oh I got this.
*  I'll pay for everything.
*  In about like 24 hours of my brain I'm like I gotta get out of this.
*  Like how do I reset.
*  Maybe you're overdosing.
*  Maybe it's like binge drinking.
*  Yeah maybe.
*  You know if you have a glass of wine with dinner you don't feel like, oh get that fucking
*  wine away from me.
*  That is true.
*  But if you drink like Burt Kreischer you drink fucking boxes of wine.
*  Burt would get on the treadmill and drink a box of wine on the treadmill.
*  Burt suffers from the same disease Patrice had.
*  He doesn't know how, like he's so this one of a kind person that everything he says and
*  all the advice he tries to give don't work for anyone else because he's one of a kind.
*  So he'll say here's what you gotta do and you go that doesn't apply to me.
*  Do you know what I'm saying?
*  We can't be on a treadmill drinking a box of wine and then go do a show for 200 grand.
*  We're different people.
*  He can keep going.
*  I've never seen anyone like him.
*  He's a freak athlete believe it or not.
*  I believe that.
*  Tom Segura played him in a game of tennis and Tom got a tennis coach.
*  They had this big tennis match.
*  They even did it on one of those Your Moms House live screens.
*  They made a big deal out of it.
*  Big tennis match.
*  Burt destroyed him.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Drunk, hungover, giant belly, serves like a pro.
*  He said he literally serves like a fucking division one college player.
*  I didn't know that about him.
*  That's pretty impressive.
*  He goes what the fuck.
*  He goes his serve is insane.
*  That makes total sense.
*  I'm like somewhat surprised by it.
*  He's like a John Daly type.
*  Just got it.

*  Yeah, he just knows how to do stuff.
*  He's also got this bizarre confidence that allows him to not have anxiety about trying
*  new things.
*  Great for this business.
*  Oh yeah, just dives in, takes his shirt off.
*  Look at me.
*  Well I was just thinking like, because early he went on something where he was gone.
*  If someone tells you to quit drinking, don't stop drinking.
*  Tell them to shut up.
*  Drinking is the best thing.
*  Oh Jesus Christ, you know how many alcoholics are hearing this right now, Bert?
*  Some people should quit, some people shouldn't.
*  I get what he was trying to do.
*  I get the point that he was trying to do.
*  Is this the tennis match?
*  See this.
*  Boom.
*  Oh that was beautiful.
*  What is he doing there?
*  He hit it over the fence.
*  Yeah but the form of that was beautiful.
*  What did he do there?
*  I think he aced him.
*  Oh he did ace him.
*  Oh Tom's flustered.
*  Yeah, he's really good.
*  Tom's just happy he didn't snap his leg here.
*  Boom.
*  Yeah look at that fucking serve.
*  Bro it's got a curve to it too.
*  That's great.
*  Also Bert looks fit here.
*  Well.
*  Is that the outfit?
*  That's for him.
*  For him he's fit.
*  He loses weight, he gets way down and then he binges up again.
*  He gets crazy again.
*  He lost like 60 pounds and got real fit, didn't drink for like three months.
*  And then he just goes crazy again.
*  Yeah has a good time.
*  I love him though but I was just saying like the advice thing.
*  Like did you ever work with Patrice or know him good?
*  One time I'm in New York.
*  This is the late great Patrice O'Neil.
*  I'm going through a thing with a girl at the time.
*  People ask you how you're doing and if you're sad.
*  I'm a pretty honest guy.
*  I'm just going, my girlfriend's driving me crazy.
*  She's back at the apartment when I was in New York.
*  She's back.
*  It's just stressing me out.
*  I'm like, I'm going to go to the stage, have a good time, have some drinks.
*  I need to like just whatever.
*  He goes, here's what you do man.
*  You're a good looking guy.
*  And I was like, yeah?
*  I don't think I'm going to get advice from Patrice.
*  You know this would be great.
*  He goes, you're a good looking guy man.
*  Bring another girl home.
*  Right!
*  Is that what he said?
*  He goes, I've seen the way these girls look at you around there.
*  You find one of these bitches.
*  You have a good time.
*  Don't worry about what's back at the apartment.
*  Then when the time comes, bring her back.
*  Bring her back to your apartment and say, yo this is me.
*  You got to deal with this shit.
*  And I was like, Patrice, you're my hero.
*  I love you.
*  Terrible advice.
*  Terrible advice.
*  You're going to get me murdered.
*  You're going to get murdered.
*  Also that's just not the type of women I hang out with.
*  They're not going to be fine with that.
*  Yeah, that's a very specific type of woman.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  Who are probably going to murder you.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Time's ticking on that.
*  Exactly.
*  I had a friend of mine that said that he was going to, I talked to my girlfriend and we
*  were doing a threesome.
*  I had the same exact feeling as someone saying to me, hey I started making my own bombs.
*  Right, you go, don't do that.
*  Jesus Christ, you're going to die.
*  But I think that that's what you should think when you hear your heroes or Burt tell you
*  anything.
*  Just know their lives are different than yours.
*  Yeah, there's some certain one of a kind people that you just got to say, not everybody can
*  do that.
*  Like Burt went and got a liver screen and cancer.
*  He's fine.
*  He's fine.
*  He can do it.
*  He's fine.
*  He is a machine.
*  He gets his health checked and his health is fine.
*  He's 50 years old.
*  He's still going hard.
*  How old is Burt now?
*  He's got to be deep into his 40s.
*  But Burt will be like, don't quit drinking.
*  Have a good time.
*  And then some guy's like, I'm hitting my wife again.
*  Dude, this booze.
*  He was probably drunk when he said that.
*  You probably got that.
*  He probably took some time off and then had a drink.
*  Started feeling good.
*  I want to tweet some advice.
*  Yeah, it was one of those things.
*  Because I love him.
*  And a lot of the comments were like, oh another comedian not understanding another comedian.
*  I was like, no, it's not that I love Burt.
*  If you knew our relationship, you'd get it.
*  Where we're good.
*  I just want people to know if you do have a problem, it's okay to quit.
*  Especially you as a person who quit.
*  I was just saying, this is a sensitive subject for some people.
*  It is.
*  Because look, I have certain friends that have recovered from alcoholism.
*  And this one buddy that I had that used to drink, he would drink and then his eyes would
*  glaze over like a shark's.
*  Like the pupils would be gone and he wasn't there anymore.
*  Like, oh, Bob's gone.
*  Now this is fucking drunk Bob.
*  Drunk Bob, totally different human being.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  He would black out all the time, not remember things.
*  Like you don't remember what you did.
*  Like he didn't remember anything.
*  I was that guy.
*  I would be fun, fun, fun until it wasn't fun.
*  Dude, I think it's a genetic thing.
*  I am guessing.
*  But I've never had that.
*  So I've got to assume that it's a genetic thing.
*  I've gotten fucked up before.
*  I've gotten really drunk.
*  I've never like, I need to get drunk.
*  I've never been like, I need to get drunk.
*  But I have friends that I have one gear, dude.
*  So there's a thing.
*  Yeah, one gear, one gear.
*  If we're going to smoke weed, I smoke all the weed.
*  And you know what I'm saying?
*  If we're doing coke, you're going to Tijuana.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I'm King Coke guy.
*  You know?
*  Why do one Viagra when I can do six Viagras?
*  You know, like I just don't have a and that's why also like it works to my benefit.
*  You know, the first time I said I'm going to do stand up, I never stopped.
*  Like I was up there.
*  I was obsessed.
*  Did you ever get hit in the head real hard?
*  Yeah, I played a lot of like sports growing up.
*  So yeah, I got hit.
*  I've had two really serious concussions where I went to the hospital.
*  Yeah.
*  You think that's it?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  I had two big ones where I lost a week.
*  I mean, I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but I do know that that is one of the side
*  effects of brain injury is that you lose impulse control.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, I've got no governor, which works good.
*  You know, it works good for some things.
*  Like, you know, like I said, when I'm hanging out with a girl, like I'm best boyfriend ever.
*  I'm King, you know.
*  But and then it's got to be extremely not right.
*  You know, there's kind of these extremes.
*  Yeah, you got to get to know someone.
*  If you're diving in with someone for 24 hours, 48 hours, you just met them like the chances
*  of you guys jiving perfectly are not that good.
*  It's like not even 50 50.
*  If you get lucky, you find the girl of your dreams.
*  And then, hey, we've been together.
*  We hung out together for two days in a row.
*  And then fuck, we were married six months later and we live happily ever after.
*  That's real.
*  That's true.
*  I've met people like that.
*  But generally, right.
*  First of all, when you meet someone, you barely meeting them.
*  You're meeting the thing that they put on when they want someone to like them.
*  It's performative a little for sure.
*  I always say to young guys, try to become the person you pretend to be when you're trying
*  to get laid.
*  Wait, say that again.
*  Try to be become the person that you're pretending to be when you're trying to get laid.
*  I like that.
*  It just be that person and you never have to pretend.
*  I love that.
*  I believe that outside of the idea of relationships.
*  I always say, and I probably heard this somewhere, read it somewhere, but the idea of you can
*  be like your heroes.
*  What do you like about the person you say you like?
*  They're kind.
*  Okay, so just be kind.
*  That's what people like.
*  Or, oh, I like that guy because he's down to earth.
*  So then you should try to be down to earth.
*  It's very, you should be like the people.
*  And you can also have anti-heroes.
*  Me and my parents have a very tumultuous relationship.
*  And so that's a positive for me because I'm going, I don't want to be like that.
*  Yes.
*  Or that quality that I don't want to be like.
*  And so.
*  For me, it was always lazy people.
*  I had a severe disdain for lazy people, like an aggressive disdain.
*  I'd be angry at people if they were lazy.
*  When I was a young man, it's because I was so scared of being lazy.
*  I was so scared of being a loser that if I saw any laziness in people, I'd get angry.
*  Which is weird because you love pot.
*  Yeah, but that is a different.
*  A lot of pot guys are just, they're happy with their laziness.
*  Yeah, that's not me, man.
*  I know.
*  You're the opposite.
*  You're like the most productive pothead I've ever known.
*  It's not a, to me, it doesn't slow me down.
*  It makes me think more.
*  And when I think more, I think about all the shit I need to get done.
*  And I think about like how I'll feel if I don't accomplish what I don't accomplish.
*  Like if I don't put in the work, I start freaking out.
*  What's your exact strand?
*  Because that's the one everyone needs.
*  Whatever the strand is you're doing.
*  I like sativas over indicas, but I don't like to get super duper high.
*  I just, I know, it's like drunk.
*  It's like I like two drinks.
*  Two drinks and I go on stage.
*  I'm the life of the party.
*  We're all friends.
*  Come on, what's up?
*  Four drinks and I'm like, what did I just talk about five minutes ago?
*  Make sure I don't repeat my jokes.
*  Make sure I don't bring up something that I'm not sure where it goes yet.
*  I didn't look at my notes before I went on stage.
*  I can't.
*  Four drinks is too much.
*  Or you go, I'll scrap these first four parts of the bit and just do this joke.
*  And you're like, why'd you scrap those?
*  I was like, I was drunk.
*  I just jumped right to that part.
*  Plot makes me really consider all the things I'm not doing.
*  It makes me call friends and check in on them.
*  It makes me like way more like kind and compassionate and friendly.
*  I want to hug people.
*  Mushrooms does that for me.
*  Same thing.
*  Yeah, that one was like a life changing thing for me.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm trying to explain something scientific that I don't know nothing about.
*  But if I had to describe how it felt, it felt like it connected things for me.
*  Where I was like, oh, I need to be a little bit more, I need to work on this or I need
*  to check in with so and so or I need to let go of that.
*  And that was all because of, I kind of came back a different guy after mushrooms.
*  Well, I think one of the primary things that it does is it dissolves your ego.
*  And the ego, I think, is a giant cage that we all live in.
*  You can kind of see the world from outside the cage, but the ego is there protecting
*  you from reality sometimes.
*  The ego is there protecting you from your understanding of your own mistakes, which
*  we all have.
*  And some people bullshit themselves, but they keep it in the back of their head.
*  The ego is what's doing all that for you.
*  And it's doing that as like this little shield, this little cage that you put in that allows
*  you to move through the world.
*  And mushrooms just takes that down.
*  And then you just get to see the world for what it really is and see you for where you
*  really are and then see like some of the behaviors that you always regret about yourself.
*  You go, why am I doing that?
*  What is that?
*  And then you can kind of see the roots of it all.
*  Or you see the cause and effect of interactions with people.
*  I remember one time I had a psychedelic experience and I was closing my eyes and I saw positive
*  thoughts as a different pattern.
*  Like I had a negative thought and the pattern turned like dark.
*  And then I had a positive thought like, oh no, don't think negative.
*  And it went like flowered open.
*  Love these beautiful patterns.
*  And then it was like the thing, like the mushroom was telling me that's the way to go.
*  That's the way to go.
*  That perception.
*  Yeah, you can lean into negativity if you want to.
*  You want to be a cunt.
*  There's plenty of cunts out there.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's people out there that are doing that.
*  They're filled with anxiety.
*  It's wrecking their life.
*  Dude.
*  Just nice.
*  People love being wronged.
*  Yeah, they do.
*  It's such a treat for them to hold on to their wrong.
*  The things they've been wronged.
*  And so that's such a great way to describe that.
*  Because really my failures and my flaws and the things I want to work on and all that
*  stuff are the connection.
*  When I was able to go, man, I think I really have a problem here and I need some help,
*  people were excited to help me.
*  Because it gave them a chance to help and serve and connect.
*  And so as opposed to me thinking I needed to pretend I didn't have a problem or they
*  wouldn't be my friends, it made them so much better friends knowing like, oh, we can help
*  them.
*  And that's just I keep using sobriety as an example.
*  But just in general, the connection is that.
*  The connection is everything.
*  Real connection with people is everything.
*  And you got to have good people around you.
*  This whole idea of being nice, mean, cool.
*  Some people can't be nice.
*  They're surrounded by assholes.
*  They're surrounded by people that are fucking with them and taking from them and ruining
*  their life and interjecting in their life.
*  And they're just like, ugh, they have to stand up for themselves.
*  But you've got to at least aspire to get into a better situation in life and surround yourself
*  somehow.
*  There's a way.
*  I've done it.
*  You've done it.
*  Surround yourself with nice people.
*  100 percent.
*  It can be done.
*  Yeah, 100 percent.
*  Find a group, find a friend, find a church, find a whatever.
*  And also be that person so that you attract those people.
*  Again, try to figure it out.
*  I was describing my buddy Chris the other day, like what I think the problem is with
*  kind of like modern times.
*  That's kind of vague.
*  I've always seen my life as like I got dealt a card of hands.
*  Some of those cards were real good and some of the cards not good.
*  But that's the hand that was dealt.
*  We've all been dealt some hand of cards.
*  A lot of people bad ones.
*  Some people really good ones.
*  We've just been dealt a hand.
*  And I thought to myself, how can I play these cards?
*  I didn't start bitching about the rules of poker.
*  I didn't start going, hey, dealer, maybe we should change the whole board.
*  All I can do is play my hand.
*  And I think that like that's kind of how I'm viewing modern times.
*  Where people would rather complain about the rules of poker instead of just playing their
*  hands the best way they could.
*  Well, it's outcasts for the first time get collectively as a group and then act like
*  bullies.
*  So they act like people have acted to them.
*  Like the most, you know, it's that old expression hurt people hurt people.
*  Right.
*  So the nastiest, meanest people online.
*  I find.
*  Other than like white radical white supremacist Nazis and shit.
*  What just you're talking about social issues, the meanest people with the left wing people
*  for whatever reason, especially now.
*  And this is not to say there's not some cunts out there that are right wing people.
*  There's a ton of them.
*  Yeah.
*  But I just it's commonplace for people who consider themselves good, kind people to say
*  things like punch a Nazi.
*  Right.
*  And then they get to define what a Nazi is and has nothing to do with this.
*  Right.
*  Nothing to do with hate and Jews.
*  You know, you just be voted Republican.
*  Oh, you're a fascist.
*  Right.
*  OK.
*  You tell me, first of all, what does that mean?
*  Yeah.
*  You tell me what that means.
*  Tell me what that word define that word.
*  You throw that word around so often.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's a word that there's a lot of there's a lot of definitions of that word, right wing,
*  you know, authoritarian government, all that stuff.
*  But also like forcing people to behave and think in a certain way.
*  They hate about religion.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's also they hate religion because religious people tell them what to think and
*  do.
*  And then they do a religious act of being like a liberal going, if you don't think like
*  me, you must be bad.
*  Racism is their devil.
*  And it's OK to hate the devil.
*  And so they try to hate it.
*  Do you know Mark Andreessen is he's a brilliant venture capitalist, like super genius guy.
*  And he'd been on my podcast a couple of times.
*  He broke the whole woke thing down as a religion and like it is explained how you can get ex
*  communicated and cast out.
*  And that's and people are fearful of that.
*  So they stay inside the lines.
*  Yeah, there's a doctrine they all follow.
*  They're using race because guess what?
*  Who would want to be friends with the racists?
*  It's also gender.
*  It's also like stupid shit.
*  Like you could be non-binary.
*  If you're a white man, you got nowhere to go.
*  Hey, I can't be I can't even be like right.
*  Fucked with like nothing.
*  No one's discriminating against me.
*  You can become non-binary.
*  Sure. Oh, great.
*  You still fuck girls.
*  You just have to say you're they them.
*  Well, for like in my ex, like in for what I've like in my observation, like the left used
*  to be really like the cool, the progressive side, the nice side, the good side.
*  Whereas to now, like I'm like, listen to yourselves.
*  You don't like rich people.
*  Right. You're mad at anyone wealthy.
*  You're mad at the super wealthy.
*  You hate Jim bros.
*  You hate frat guys.
*  You hate straight white guys.
*  You hate boomers.
*  You're mad at your grandparents.
*  You seem to not like a lot of people.
*  For being the most just generalizing, just completely generalizing.
*  Right. Also, where's our empathy?
*  I think if I ever met like a crazy right wing, which I never have met any of these
*  Nazis they're talking about.
*  But if I did meet one, I believe that I could have some empathy for them and some sympathy
*  and go, they're just dumb.
*  Yeah. They're not evil.
*  They're just dumb and they can be like convinced otherwise.
*  They're also they're also programmed.
*  Right. It's generally they're programmed by the people around them.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  But where's our empathy?
*  I watched this documentary on Netflix.
*  It was about like the KKK and the woman who made the documentary was like kind of a cute
*  Muslim girl and she like interviewed actual white nationalists and KKK members and she
*  brings them into this thing.
*  And what I learned from that documentary, what I got from it was that like, oh, they
*  don't even really believe this.
*  They just wanted a group.
*  They wanted a daddy.
*  They wanted someone to like so they thought to themselves, I can hate black people.
*  I mean, if if they're over there, I don't ever have to confront one and I don't ever
*  have to be when they will meet a black guy, they'll go, well, not you.
*  We're talking about the idea.
*  They're not even talking about that actual person.
*  And the girl in the documentary goes, well, you know that you let me in and you've been
*  very nice to me and I'm a Muslim woman.
*  And the guy's like, well, not you.
*  You're talking about. Yeah.
*  So it's because they just wanted a group like you.
*  Right. They just wanted a group like like black gang members or Hispanic MS 19, whatever
*  these groups are, whatever your little lesbian group is, whatever your baseball team is,
*  they've needed a group.
*  And their group was like, I can hate some people I've never seen before.
*  Yeah. And that's why it's so dangerous.
*  Like groups like where they can get entrapped because the the Governor Whitmer case, do
*  you know that case?
*  These guys conspired to kidnap the governor of Michigan, Michigan.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And there's 14 people involved.
*  Twelve of them were FBI informants.
*  Yeah. I mean, he got these two dudes who just wanted to be in a group.
*  Yeah, that's it. Two guys.
*  Hey, man, we're going to kidnap the government.
*  Fuck it.
*  That's hilarious. Yeah.
*  They just wanted some shit.
*  Yeah. Red Riders.
*  I'm in. I'm in. What time?
*  I can't probably add a name for their gang.
*  They were cool. They're calling.
*  They had a group chat. Probably felt real cool.
*  Yeah. We're doing it.
*  We're going to make some change.
*  We're getting a duct tape. Vigilantes.
*  Yeah. Meanwhile, these two guys thought they were cosplaying and then they got arrested.
*  Like, I didn't know. I didn't really plan on doing it.
*  I know. It wasn't even my idea.
*  It's tricky.
*  Another problem I've noticed, too, along these lines, is like, let's say we're in a group.
*  Let's say we have some group and then we find out one of the guys in our group did a bad thing.
*  But we got to pay our bills. We got a group.
*  And also we do have time to camaraderie.
*  So a bad thing groups like to do is cover up for that person.
*  Right.
*  So like, it's not like every Catholic priest.
*  I've heard all your terrible bits at the comedy clubs about the Catholic priests from every comic I know.
*  It's not like all the ones were fine with sexually molesting children.
*  It's just that there were a lot that did.
*  And the church thought, this is not going to look good for us.
*  Let's cover this up.
*  It happens in the military. Sometimes there's some bad guys in the military.
*  And instead of like, they don't want people to think if you send your daughters to the military, bad things are going to happen.
*  So they kind of internally deal with it.
*  You know, and that's a bad thing that groups do, is that even in our own government goes, all right, let's find a way to cover that up instead of dealing with this.
*  Because if we just deal with it, it's kind of reflect poorly on the group.
*  What are we going to do with this Epstein client list?
*  Is it really helping the world?
*  Does Mr. Gates need this kind of attention?
*  Exactly.
*  He's out there trying to cure polio. Leave him alone.
*  Exactly.
*  So you start to think, let's protect the group.
*  Right.
*  And we do it in all these ways.
*  I think that that's happened with the LGBTQ plus whatever.
*  I think a lot of gay people are waking up and going, why did we let the trans people in this group?
*  They're making us look terrible.
*  Well, lesbians are having a real problem with it because there's a lot of trans men who identify as lesbian.
*  Yes.
*  Are trans women.
*  They say they're a lesbian and they get on lesbian apps and these girls are like, I'm looking for a vagina.
*  100%.
*  Yeah.
*  What a dick.
*  And now they're waking up going, maybe the trans struggle was different than the gay struggle, but we've let them in the group and now.
*  Well, a lot of gay guys think that the movement is homophobic because you're telling a young gay guy, no, you're a woman.
*  You're actually a woman.
*  Well, it's one of those things that you got to say some people, it must be true because it's always been a thing.
*  Like to have real gender dysphoria, to be in your mind, feel like a woman has always been a thing.
*  Even if you're a guy, there's more feminine women that feel like women.
*  So it's like that's real.
*  But also when you encourage that and you reward people socially for that and then you have Pride Day at kindergarten.
*  And you're talking about like sexual orientation, people that are nowhere near puberty, which is really crazy.
*  And then you start like having people that become trans.
*  All of a sudden, they're amazing where they were just really mediocre before.
*  Like Bruce Jenner, like he was the goof of the Kardashian show.
*  First of all, it makes no sense.
*  No one's accomplished shit.
*  This motherfucker was on the cover of star.
*  He was a star.
*  He was a fucking gold medalist in the decathlon, the goddamn Olympics.
*  He was a stud.
*  He was a stud.
*  And meanwhile, he's on this show with these influencers and he's just getting nothing.
*  He's just mocked.
*  He's like, I could be a pretty gal.
*  Just openly mocked.
*  He becomes a woman.
*  He's woman of the year in six months.
*  In six months, he took over the fucking game.
*  He's a winner.
*  It's like a Chinese autistic kid coming into your math class and fucking up the curve.
*  How do they get here?
*  What's going on here?
*  This guy's a G. He's got a 287 IQ.
*  This is not fair.
*  He just came in and took over.
*  Superwoman?
*  Everyone loved him until he started saying he was voting for Trump.
*  Now they hate him.
*  Which was hilarious.
*  Like people were saying it's OK to misgender her.
*  This person, call him Caitlin, call her Caitlin, whatever, doesn't seem to care.
*  Right.
*  Is fine with you dead naming her.
*  This is who she is now.
*  She's comfortable in her own skin.
*  60 years old, out of the closet, the whole deal.
*  Yay.
*  But people are, I saw this thing online where someone was saying it's OK to misgender
*  Caitlyn Jenner because she voted for Trump.
*  So OK, so transphobia is OK if someone differs with you politically.
*  It's crazy.
*  Like what are you doing?
*  You're not being compassionate.
*  You're not being kind.
*  All these things that you said is only with total compliance are you willing to give people
*  this grace.
*  You must have total compliance to our ideology or you're cast out of the kingdom.
*  It's a leverage of power.
*  Even if you're a trans woman, which is like at the top of the oppression list, they're
*  above regular poor black people, poor Mexicans, poor immigrants.
*  Trans people's the top of the mountain.
*  They're attacking their own.
*  They're literally like cannibalists just going like, oh, there's one, but it didn't fall
*  in line.
*  Didn't fall in line.
*  Throw them out.
*  Yeah, that's the worst.
*  I also think it's like just a big overcorrection.
*  I think I think humans are like guilty of always over correcting.
*  So it's like we were racist.
*  Yes.
*  Historically, I could go on about that for hours.
*  But like let's say that's the idea that we're agreeing with that historically, America was
*  racist.
*  So now the overcorrection is anything that is racist must be.
*  Don't ever even accuse a person of color of something wrong because because we have to
*  so over correct and we have to say how many black friends we have and say how cool black
*  things are and don't say that their hair is different because that would be a racist thing.
*  Right.
*  Or oh, we used to be homophobic.
*  So now if a guy sucks a dick, let's give him a parade.
*  Let's put him in the White House.
*  Celebrate.
*  Exactly.
*  Let's get him in charge of the fucking guy in the dress who's in charge of nuclear energy.
*  Just let him suck dick.
*  That was stealing women's clothes.
*  Yeah, just let him suck dick.
*  We didn't need him to be in power.
*  The person's not exceptional just because they wear a dress.
*  Right.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's a nutty person.
*  You're not virtuous.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And I think that there's a big difference between just letting someone live their life
*  and being kind to them in society and not treating them differently and giving them
*  all the same rights as opposed to celebrating it.
*  I think you're absolutely right.
*  It's just an extreme overcorrection.
*  What we need to do is just let people be themselves.
*  Right.
*  And figure out who that is.
*  But what is weird is when it becomes encouraged.
*  And so then you get like with girls in particular, they're very vulnerable.
*  Abigail Schreier wrote a book about this about how many girls that are on the spectrum get
*  convinced that they're trans.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the problem is there's some states that allow you, I think if you're 15, you
*  can go and get puberty blockers or at the very least you can get testosterone.
*  I know you can do that.
*  Do you know that like Planned Parenthood is like the number one prescriber of testosterone?
*  See if that's true.
*  But I think Planned Parenthood prescribes more testosterone than anybody, which is really
*  crazy if that's true.
*  That's wild.
*  Because I think in some places they help people with gender transition.
*  So if you're a girl in some states, you don't even have to be an adult.
*  You can go to them and you don't have the permission of your parents.
*  And if you I don't know who you have to consult with or what you have to do, but I've heard
*  it's alarmingly easy.
*  Yeah.
*  And then now you're on testosterone.
*  And one of the things that testosterone does is it alleviates anxiety, makes you feel stronger.
*  You feel like more alert, more alive like this.
*  This is what I was missing.
*  Right.
*  I was missing testosterone.
*  It's like, no, you weren't.
*  No, you weren't.
*  That's not a natural part of your body.
*  You just added something and now you feel way different.
*  But now you're going to change your voice.
*  And if you grow out of this and if this is just a phase, well, now you've fucked up your
*  life and you can't ever have children.
*  Right.
*  And there's a bunch of those ladies out there, the D-transitioners.
*  They're stuck with deep voices for their whole lives.
*  They're stuck with masculine features.
*  They've cut their breasts off.
*  I got in trouble for posting.
*  Or they're adults.
*  I got in trouble for posting this.
*  Is that true about Planned Parenthood?
*  I don't want to get sued.
*  Have you been sued?
*  No.
*  Anybody ever sued you?
*  I did read it in a...
*  I see one article, but I don't know if this is a legit site.
*  What does it say?
*  Oh, it says that, but I'm trying to find out.
*  I don't know what the...
*  It's the Dallas Express.
*  It doesn't seem like...
*  That's the number one newspaper on the universe.
*  It's gotta be.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Everyone's reading that.
*  Dallas Express.
*  Planned Parenthood among largest suppliers of testosterone.
*  Right there.
*  In the headlines.
*  Let's see what the numbers are.
*  Do they say numbers?
*  I didn't even get it.
*  800 visits per year to more than 2,500.
*  That whole fucking expression, gender-affirming care, freaks me out, man.
*  I got in trouble for posting this.
*  I said, if genitals don't define gender, how does removing them affirm it?
*  That's fucking touche.
*  That's touche, right there.
*  What are we doing?
*  Like, if...
*  Yeah.
*  It's really crazy.
*  You said, like, I don't need to have a vagina to be a woman,
*  then why do I need to remove my penis to be a woman?
*  Whoa, back that up again?
*  The number of gender-affirming hormone therapy visits to Planned Parenthood
*  tripled between 2021 and 2023,
*  growing from 800 visits per year to more than 2,500.
*  That's crazy.
*  That shows you that it's a social contagion,
*  and that's Abigail Shrier's position on it.
*  And it's a very compassionate, kind position.
*  Sure.
*  And it's about the future of children and them making decisions
*  when they're very impressionable.
*  And boy, do people attack her.
*  They removed her from bookstores.
*  They called her transphobic.
*  Just for literally talking about facts and statistics,
*  and the numbers have increased, and the psychological effect.
*  Like, what's going on with them psychologically?
*  Like, why are they being led?
*  Who are these?
*  What is the actual odds that nine friends all become trans?
*  What are the odds that?
*  It's almost zero.
*  It's preposterous.
*  It's preposterous.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  But then again, it is also a real thing.
*  Like, there's always been people that have felt like they should have been a woman.
*  And if you're a grown adult and you want to make that decision,
*  yeah, you do whatever you want to do.
*  Yeah.
*  I've met trans people that say they are very happy with what they've done.
*  Yeah.
*  That's great.
*  I guess.
*  But you got to know what the fuck that is.
*  And when you're 13, you don't.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if I'd encourage it even in an adult.
*  I know that the correct statement for me right now would be like,
*  just leave our kids alone.
*  But I think that maybe I don't even want to encourage adults.
*  We just got to pursue your own things.
*  And I think that's beautiful.
*  And I think that's what our country's about.
*  But in my mind...
*  Find a dude who doesn't care about the dick.
*  Exactly.
*  If you're a trans woman, find a dude.
*  Find Jim Norton.
*  Oh, yeah, exactly.
*  You can find a Jim Norton.
*  You could have gotten a celebrity.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's what happened with Jim.
*  He's got a trans woman for a wife.
*  He's happy.
*  He talks about the dick.
*  You know what's crazy about the Jim Norton thing?
*  Is that like, you know, he's with these tough crowd guys.
*  He's with all my heroes.
*  I looked up to Jim Norton my whole life.
*  I love Jim Norton.
*  I'm a fan.
*  And then they go, you know, he's married to a trans woman.
*  And I was like, the fuck?
*  And everyone's like, oh, you, Jeff, and your trans thing.
*  I was like, no, if I know Jim Norton, he wouldn't have got married.
*  That's really what I was shocked about.
*  The institution of marriage he believes in.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  This is Jim Norton.
*  That's the overcorrection.
*  You want to show this is really your wife?
*  You're going to marry her.
*  Right.
*  Whereas all the girlfriends, all the girls, they're a little stinky vaginas.
*  Get out of here.
*  Get out of here.
*  You're not getting married.
*  You can't take my last name.
*  Fuck off.
*  I'm waiting for a dick.
*  Yeah, it's very crazy, man.
*  That's the overcorrection.
*  But you wouldn't encourage someone, and I know that I'm going to take some hits for this,
*  but you wouldn't encourage someone who believed that their body was fat if it wasn't healthily,
*  you know, like with an eating disorder.
*  And they said, Joe, but I...
*  I think Tucker Carlson said that.
*  You don't say, oh, you are fat.
*  Yeah, Joe, but I believe I should be.
*  And you go, you're dying, dude.
*  Right.
*  Or it's, no, what he said it about was anorexics.
*  Like you would never tell an anorexic, oh, you are fat.
*  And that's real.
*  Right.
*  People are really out there believing.
*  They look in the mirror, they're a skeleton.
*  But they look in the mirror and they go, I'm gross.
*  I'm fat.
*  Exactly.
*  You wouldn't encourage it.
*  You would never encourage that.
*  You would say, no, there's something wrong.
*  Correct. You would treat it.
*  I think the other problem is that the whole way they do it, you can't orgasm ever again.
*  Okay.
*  And you don't really have a vagina.
*  You have this hole, right?
*  And then you have to keep that whole dilated.
*  You have to stick something inside it.
*  I think it's like lip jobs.
*  Like don't get the early ones.
*  Wait till they get this down.
*  Don't let people experiment on you by splicing your dick open like a hot dog.
*  Wait.
*  Yeah.
*  Just hang in there.
*  Wait for the iPod 6.
*  Wait for gene therapy.
*  Because I firmly believe it might not be in our lifetime, but maybe in our children or our grandchildren's lifetime,
*  gene editing will get to a place where they will be able to turn you into whatever the fuck you want.
*  Right.
*  And it's probably going to be a nightmare because every guy is going to look like Thor and every woman is going to look like a prime Jennifer Lopez.
*  It's like there's not going to be any variations.
*  Everyone's going to be super hot.
*  Right.
*  You're not going to appreciate hot people.
*  Yeah, you will big whoop.
*  Yeah, because like, you know, when you when a hot woman walks in a room and there's no other hot women,
*  everyone's like, whoa, one's here.
*  Look what I got.
*  Look at her.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  What does she look like naked?
*  Right.
*  But if everybody looks like that, it's going to be commonplace.
*  And I think we're going to get to a place where every man's going to look like the Hulk.
*  It's just going to be just giant dudes.
*  Nerds will for sure.
*  100%.
*  They're going to be the first to sign up for that.
*  You know, all these fucking dudes that go to the coffee shop and sit there with their legs crossed like this.
*  No working out.
*  They're fucking their shoulders slumped.
*  They're going to look like the rock just fucking raw.
*  They're all going to be beasts.
*  Dude, you know, it's interesting about the like comic book world.
*  All the guys who like they read comics and it's Thor.
*  Right.
*  Got shoulders like you and biceps like you.
*  He's Spider-Man.
*  They're reading Hulk.
*  All these dudes that are just fantastic, fantastic heroes that can give us justice and beat your enemies.
*  Batman.
*  But then if they see you at the coffee shop, they go, look at this douchebag.
*  You go, what?
*  I look like your comic books.
*  Like if Joe Rogan walked in, they should be going, holy shit, how does he look like that?
*  I want to look like that.
*  Isn't it also weird that it's like the feeblest men that really love the super powerful men in these fantasy, but not real life.
*  But they don't want to just work out to look like them.
*  They was that's too hard, Jeff.
*  But just do it.
*  Be like your heroes.
*  I go in there and they beg on me.
*  They look at me weird.
*  It's so hard if you're like scrawny and you go to a gym for the first time.
*  It's so disheartening.
*  It's tough.
*  And there's all these girls with those fucking yoga pants on that you might as well be a pile of shit to them.
*  Well, there's all these big jack guys doing squats.
*  That's motivation, baby.
*  Can you spot me?
*  You're a spider.
*  It's like you're sitting there with your little fucking 10 pound dumbbells.
*  My arms.
*  It takes so long to get strong.
*  You guys, if you were slamming weights, you guys love to slam weights.
*  So long to get strong.
*  It takes forever.
*  So many reps.
*  Oh, you got to keep doing it or you shrink.
*  Yeah, you got to come back tomorrow.
*  They go, oh, I got to do this again tomorrow.
*  It's so hard that most people just want to dismiss it.
*  But it's fun.
*  If you could do it in a pill, you would always tell it to anybody.
*  If I could give you a pill and that pill would give you more energy throughout the day, you could pick up anything and carry things around.
*  You never have to worry about yourself physically.
*  You're stronger than most people you meet.
*  You know how to fight.
*  Wouldn't you take that pill?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you can do that pill, Stu, but it's called hard work.
*  Absolutely.
*  That's all it is.
*  That's so true.
*  Yeah.
*  That's all it is.
*  And it'll change everything for you.
*  It'll change everything for you.
*  You know how it's boring to take all those vitamins?
*  Take the vitamins, you fucking retard.
*  But Joe.
*  Open up the cabinet.
*  We don't all have to.
*  I've got to work at Chipotle.
*  You've got enough protein and enough fat.
*  Your fucking car is a race car.
*  But Joe, I don't have the free time.
*  I have a family.
*  Everybody has free time.
*  You just choose to do it with other things.
*  Just to sit there with your fucking phone out.
*  Yep.
*  Scrolling through Instagram and checking your likes
*  and arguing with people on Twitter.
*  Yeah.
*  That's how I feel.
*  You got plenty of time to go to McDonald's.
*  You got time to...
*  David Goggins has that great quote where he's like,
*  he says, this guy said to me,
*  oh, the gym membership is too expensive.
*  He goes, you got a motherfucking floor where you live?
*  You got a ground where you're at?
*  Didn't work out, motherfucker?
*  And I love that kind of mentality of like,
*  you could do a whole workout right there.
*  All you need is a chin up bar.
*  And you don't even need that.
*  You can get those things that hang on your door.
*  You don't even have to get like a permanent...
*  Push-ups.
*  They have good chin up bars now that like attach to your door frame
*  and they're solid and they hold you in place.
*  You screw them in.
*  They're legit.
*  And all you need is that and push-ups,
*  bodyweight squats, sit-ups.
*  There's a bunch of different yoga exercises you can do.
*  There's rocks outside.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You can pick up a rock, free rock.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's not a cool kettlebell with a monkey hat on it,
*  but you know, you can...
*  Rocks.
*  Rocks are heavy.
*  Rocks are awkward, too.
*  Tree branch.
*  Sandbags.
*  7,000 parks by my house that have a bar
*  that you wouldn't have to buy on Amazon.
*  You could just go hang from it.
*  Yeah.
*  Those are always good.
*  Monkey bars, those are great.
*  That'll do it.
*  That's the number one way kids break their fucking arms, too.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  My daughter broke her arm on a monkey bar.
*  I broke my arm in a monkey bar.
*  Really?
*  At school?
*  Like she broke it at school?
*  Yeah, at school.
*  It was like a poke.
*  At school.
*  And at that school, I was like,
*  boy, that monkey bar is really high off the ground.
*  Like these fucking kids are seven.
*  Like this is crazy.
*  I like that though.
*  And she's a little reckless.
*  Ninja warrior.
*  Well, that's what it is.
*  All these kids are just trying to have fun,
*  but they don't understand their limitations yet.
*  That's why it's dangerous to have them in an environment
*  like that.
*  But that's how you learn.
*  When we were kids, they had those domes.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Climb inside.
*  Kids were always getting concussions.
*  There's foots in it, but they fall this way.
*  Fall, their legs rip apart.
*  Those fucking things.
*  What's the dome one?
*  We had an actual circular one that was little triangles.
*  Yeah, we had one of those, too.
*  But there was one that was like a half a circle.
*  It was like a dome with all these monkey bars inside of it and shit.
*  That's the one I had.
*  Yeah, we had that.
*  And there would always be like one bar missing sometimes on the thing.
*  You'd be like, what happened here?
*  Sharp edges and fucking screws sticking out of it.
*  Yeah.
*  But kids always bang their head.
*  I bang my head a hundred times on those fucking things.
*  It also forces creativity, too, because you're like,
*  you know, there's no iPad there.
*  There's no like video.
*  There's no candy crush.
*  So you had to be like, all right, this is our igloo that we're going to protect.
*  I don't know.
*  I wonder if that's good.
*  Everybody wants to like look back to the days when everyone was bored and say,
*  and like romantically, yeah, you make your own fun.
*  Like, I think if I had a video game, it would have been way more fun.
*  Well, we had both. I had the 90s.
*  So we had both.
*  Like when I was a kid, we would play video games all night.
*  But during the day, there was something fun about wrestling,
*  you know, like the human part of it.
*  So we really were making up things with guns and just like shooting each other.
*  Say the best of both worlds.
*  Yeah, we kind of both before online media or online.
*  Oh, yeah. We weren't online playing video games either.
*  It was just me versus my buddy.
*  I think the social media thing is the craziest part of it.
*  I think kids are just first of all, they're weirdly connected because they all get on Snapchat
*  and then they have a snap map so they know where all their friends are at any given time.
*  Yeah. And so they're constantly like paying attention to that
*  and finding each other and they go in groups and they go to this party and oh,
*  they're at this party. Let's go to that party.
*  They see him on the maps.
*  They're adults. You just described adults.
*  There's not even kids anymore.
*  They're little kids that are like traveling around with their friends with phones
*  and they only talk through text messages.
*  Yeah, that's adults.
*  Yeah, but it's fucking weird.
*  It sucks.
*  A weird new life.
*  They still do like kids today. They still do physical things.
*  They just still do sports, you know, but when we were kids, the thing about
*  not having any other influences, especially like social media influences,
*  you didn't really aspire to be exactly like other people, you know?
*  It's like there was groups of people that, you know, you gravitated towards being a jock.
*  You gravitated towards being an artist.
*  But you didn't try to like completely copy whatever trend is going on.
*  Nowadays kids, they leave their fucking stupid label on their Nikes.
*  Like what is that? What is that?
*  Where it's supposed to be cool to keep your fucking label on your Nikes.
*  Yeah, the tag is like, look, it's a limited edition.
*  It's like it's not.
*  I made David Lucas cut it off.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  I pulled a knife out. I go cut that off.
*  Oh my God.
*  Are you a sheep? Are you a little sheep?
*  You got a fucking tag on your Nikes?
*  And he did. He cut it off.
*  He goes, you're right. I go, I'm right.
*  I love that.
*  Who cares if everyone knows their white label or whatever it is?
*  What is it called?
*  It's called an off-white.
*  Yeah, whatever.
*  It means that it has that red tag on it.
*  Yeah, it's stupid.
*  Fucking knife out and cut it off.
*  Cut it off right in the green room.
*  That's a daddy moment for him.
*  Give him a knife.
*  You said, hey, I'm dad here.
*  You need to...
*  This is nonsense.
*  You are not doing this.
*  I love that.
*  You're not going to have a propeller on your hat.
*  Keep a sticker on your...
*  Take that propeller off your fucking hat.
*  Grow up.
*  Yeah, you don't have to have that label.
*  When I was a kid, dudes would have labels on their hats.
*  I hate that.
*  They'd buy new hats and they'd leave the tag.
*  Or the sticker on the bill is one of my biggest pet peeves.
*  The sticker on the bill is stupid.
*  Take that sticker off.
*  Take the sticker off.
*  Why do you have that shiny stupid sticker?
*  Makes no sense to me.
*  That's dumb.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that one thing that I do look backwards in and think about...
*  And this is a mushroom thought for sure.
*  This came to me, you know, whereas like...
*  I would say...
*  My mom would go, why do you need these expensive shoes for school?
*  And I didn't have the intelligence at the time to explain it to her now.
*  But now I look back and I go...
*  I wish I would have said, mom, my whole social structure is based on this.
*  Because I don't have the internet, which would later come out.
*  I don't have these things.
*  When, at least in the 90s and the late 80s when I was growing up...
*  Amber Shoemaker was the hottest girl at our school.
*  Which meant Amber Shoemaker is the hottest woman in our universe.
*  I didn't go online and go, well, Amber's not...
*  I didn't have anyone else.
*  That's the hottest girl.
*  Do you know what I'm saying?
*  The coolest guy in our school, Anthony Medina, was the coolest guy in the world.
*  Because that's our world.
*  Whereas kids now could go, who gives a shit about Anthony Medina?
*  I'm following LeBron.
*  And I'm following...
*  So like, we had our own little realities.
*  So it's like, I didn't give a shit about the bulls necessarily.
*  But if Mike Jensen from my school said the bulls are cool, I liked the bulls.
*  I didn't have anywhere to escape to.
*  I need to do what I can.
*  And I think even before me was probably even better than that.
*  I think like when cowboys roamed the earth, that might have been number one.
*  You don't think so?
*  Because here's why.
*  And hear me out.
*  That cat...
*  Let's say we're cowboys.
*  We're on the ridge line.
*  Cowboys.
*  Yeah.
*  And the sun's going down.
*  Yeah, sun's going down.
*  Kind of your house?
*  Kind of your house?
*  Or they're kind of...
*  Yeah.
*  No, no, but we're...
*  A real one?
*  We have a house.
*  But we're now on the ridge line with our horses.
*  Oh, we're on the road.
*  A few days.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  On a trail.
*  And say, hey buddy, the sun's going down.
*  Let's make a fire.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  But we got to brush the horses.
*  We got to do our shit.
*  We're eating our can.
*  We see all these twinkling lights out there.
*  And we go...
*  We got a picture of our lady in our wallet.
*  Like, oh man, I can't wait to get home to her, you know,
*  say some dirty things about her.
*  And then I would eat my beans.
*  And then I'd say, I wonder what everyone's doing out there.
*  I would just wonder.
*  Yeah, that is a really cute version of what it meant like to be a cowboy.
*  Here's what it really was like.
*  You would stay up and I would sleep because we don't want anybody raping
*  and killing us in the middle of the night.
*  Because the Indians have been following us for miles.
*  And we don't know they've been following us.
*  And we're too stupid...
*  That would be reversed, by the way.
*  You'd stay up and I'd sleep.
*  We're too stupid to cold camp.
*  Okay, so we started a fire, which makes you really easy to spot.
*  And they just wait till that fire starts getting dim and they hear snoring
*  and they come in and they cut you up and they fuck you and they do whatever they want.
*  No, you're supposed to stay awake and slaughter them.
*  There's only two of us.
*  There's like seven or eight of them.
*  And you know, back in the musket days, there's a lot of reloading time.
*  I get one of them.
*  That's why the Comanche has dominated this area.
*  Because they were using single shot guns.
*  But Joe, that's racist.
*  They were just sitting here peacefully.
*  The Comanche's... they were not.
*  The Comanche's had multiple arrows on their fingers.
*  So they'd keep like four or five arrows and they would shoot one and then shoot another one.
*  Shoot another one.
*  They were just fucking these dudes up.
*  I bet it.
*  The only thing that saved this entire state,
*  the only reason why people were able to conquer was the Colt pistol.
*  Right.
*  When they figured out how to make a pistol with like a chamber, it was Colt, right?
*  Wasn't it?
*  I think it was Colt.
*  So they developed...
*  believe this or not, at the time, the military didn't want.
*  Really?
*  They're like, what are we doing with these six shots?
*  We got one shot.
*  Really?
*  Good enough.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't know that.
*  Because the guy couldn't sell them.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  He sold them to the Texas Rangers.
*  That's amazing.
*  Jack Smith, that guy who's out in the hallway, that photograph, that's why he's there.
*  That's the original Texas Rangers.
*  Why wouldn't they want more bullets quicker, accessibly?
*  Because that's the government.
*  They're always been retarded.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  They were even retarded in the 1800s.
*  More bullets.
*  So this was a novel invention.
*  This guy figured out a revolver.
*  And it was like, you had to take the cylinder out, put a new cylinder in.
*  But every time he did, you get five or six?
*  Was it six shots or five?
*  So it was the first time ever you could fire multiple times.
*  They just started fucking up these Indians.
*  Yeah.
*  And they started taking over.
*  That was protection.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  That's great.
*  But it's these guys that like, they dressed like Indians.
*  They fucking infiltrated.
*  They cold camped.
*  They would go deep, deep, deep into like uncharted territories.
*  Those were probably just bad guys pretending to be Indians to make the Indians look bad.
*  Oh, no, no, no.
*  They were bad guys.
*  Just kidding.
*  But they were bad guys to go after the Indians.
*  Yeah.
*  They were bad guys.
*  No, but what I'm saying...
*  But so were the fucking Indians.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  They were bad to each other.
*  Exactly.
*  They were also...
*  That's why I always get so mad about the debate about like, well, you came here, like white people came here and did bad...
*  It's like, dude, do you think that they weren't all fighting for land here?
*  They weren't just fighting.
*  They didn't ever, ever, ever surrender.
*  Yeah, there was lots of tribes.
*  Because if they got...
*  If they surrendered, they were tortured and murdered.
*  Like the Comanches used to chop dudes arms off and legs off and then throw them while they're still alive on a roaring fire.
*  That's correct.
*  And watch them squirm around.
*  Yeah.
*  It was fun.
*  They were having a good time.
*  I meant mentally earlier for my early analogy of the cute cowboy stuff.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  No, no, what I was saying is that mentally we didn't compare.
*  It was dangerous, dude.
*  I know, I believe...
*  It was terrifying.
*  All that home on the range shit is straight up bullshit.
*  What I mean is they didn't compare.
*  Oh, right, because they were...
*  You hear that sound?
*  You had too many real things.
*  Someone's raping an Indian lady.
*  Right.
*  You hear that?
*  You fucking...
*  You hear gunshots and children screaming.
*  You wouldn't think, oh, so what that Jeff dies with me.
*  It's so what that he's funny.
*  He's no Dave Chappelle.
*  You didn't compare.
*  But they did, like Billy the Kid.
*  Like people became famous.
*  They became infamous.
*  These people that everybody wanted to be like Billy the Kid.
*  Well, that was one guy that we tried to be like.
*  Right now I'd go, big deal, Billy the Kid.
*  There's a guy in Japan that can shoot 70.
*  Like the phone makes you have 7 million.
*  You don't even appreciate your wife learning guitar because you go, she's no Bob Dylan.
*  You know who gives a shit.
*  So that's what I was trying to say.
*  Really shitty husband.
*  That's a...
*  That guy's mean.
*  You don't even hear it clap, just bitch.
*  What the fuck?
*  She just started.
*  Billy, give her a break, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  But I meant mentally we didn't compare.
*  I think we are not designed for it, but I think kids will be.
*  I think the human mind is going to adapt to technology and interacting with each other.
*  And I think socially people are adapting to interacting with each other.
*  You know, like the way kids like go after each other online, like they're adapted to it.
*  It's normalized to them.
*  Just like, you know, if you live in a war-torn part of the world, seeing dead people, it normalizes to you.
*  And I think kids are normalizing to electronics.
*  And people want to resist that.
*  And they want to say, I don't let my kids use electronics.
*  It's part of the world.
*  I use it.
*  It's a part of the world.
*  It's not a barrier to being a good person.
*  It's not a barrier to living a happy, healthy life.
*  Just like alcohol is not a barrier.
*  For some people it is.
*  Some people have a real fucking problem with social media.
*  And you see it a lot of comics, especially the unsuccessful ones.
*  When they start falling apart, when they get older, it just exacerbates their mental illness.
*  And then it becomes all politics.
*  These guys used to talk about farts and getting their dick sucked.
*  Now it's all politics.
*  And it's all like life hangs on every decision.
*  And we're doomed if this takes place.
*  Doomed!
*  You know what comedian dude does that is Kathy Griffin.
*  That guy doesn't lie.
*  Oh, you know what I mean.
*  You just misgendered.
*  That guy's unhinged.
*  You go on there.
*  It's all day.
*  Just some doom and gloom.
*  Do you think that that's because like that's how they find meaning in an otherwise meaningless existence?
*  Like what is it about people where their entire life becomes completely wrapped around politics?
*  To the point where they're tweeting about it literally all day long.
*  And saying these things that they think are profound about all kinds of different issues.
*  I think it's got to be some sort of virtue signaling.
*  Like it's their way to go look at how good I am.
*  It's also a way to show that you're relevant.
*  You know, you're talking about the things that people care about right now.
*  And you're chiming in and saying the things that need to be said.
*  You're being heard.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, there's a lot of like weird.
*  There's a lot of just they want attention.
*  There's a narcissism to a lot of it.
*  But then there's also people that are capable of going online and having interesting discussions with people they don't know.
*  And if you can manage that you can actually get a lot out of like Twitter and X and all these different ways.
*  You can get a lot out of it.
*  You can get a lot.
*  But it's so hard to do.
*  I know.
*  Because it's like so it's such a it's like you're you're deciphering smoke signals.
*  It's like the person's not even in front of you.
*  Yeah, you know, like you're getting these weird interactions with people.
*  There's a lot of like like what does this guy mean by that?
*  Is he right shitty?
*  Is he just being honest?
*  Like what is this?
*  Yeah, it's very tough to translate their to Saki way to community.
*  What are they doing?
*  Like what is that?
*  Were they trying to be funny right there?
*  Were they trying?
*  Yeah, it's very tricky.
*  Well, I'm very lucky and then I get to talk to so many interesting people.
*  So I don't need to have as many interesting conversations online with people.
*  Yeah.
*  And also you're a comedian.
*  My favorite thing about being a comedian is I get heard a lot.
*  Yeah, we get to be heard that even when I'm wrong.
*  I get to be heard.
*  So like is wrong and still funny.
*  Yeah, that's the beauty of that was Patrice's whole act.
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  I'm often sometimes wrong and it's just so funny to go.
*  Oh, yeah, like I like this guy.
*  It's funny.
*  And also this part of being wrong on purpose like I say things that I know is wrong on purpose because it's funny.
*  It's funny.
*  It's going for the laugh.
*  Yeah, I'm just trying to be silly.
*  I'm trying to be silly.
*  That's what I like.
*  That's the kind of comedy I like.
*  Right.
*  So I'm going to do that and you can like it or you don't like it.
*  100%.
*  What infuriates me is when people try to take jokes or talking shit and just conflate it and pretend that it's a statement.
*  I know.
*  Like you.
*  It drives me crazy.
*  Do you not have any friends?
*  I know.
*  Do you not have any friends?
*  You don't joke?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  You don't joke around?
*  You don't say all these comments want to go to the right.
*  It's because freedom of speech is a pretty big deal to us.
*  Yeah.
*  Naturally, it's a pretty big deal that we can say whatever we want because just think racism is bad.
*  Yeah, but it is kind of funny sometimes.
*  It's very funny.
*  Sexism is bad, but it's pretty funny sometimes.
*  Sometimes.
*  Yeah.
*  If it's well made.
*  It's funny.
*  If it's funny enough.
*  A good meme, a solid meme.
*  Great.
*  Love it.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Things are funny.
*  And people go, well, that's racist.
*  You go, well, and it's racial and it's funny, but don't just assume that it's this blankly bad thing.
*  Yeah, it's such a silly.
*  Like it's funny no matter who gets it.
*  Right.
*  It's funny if white guys get it.
*  It's funny if white women get it.
*  Right.
*  It's funny if Indian guys get it.
*  Yeah.
*  Things are funny when people get it.
*  When they get them jokes, it's funny.
*  And they don't care about the racial stuff when it's like a comic of any other race doing it.
*  Right.
*  You're like, if you're going to use that same measuring stick, go to the laugh factor.
*  You could cancel all 12 comedians that are on stage making easy racial remarks, but they're like, but he's Persian.
*  I know, but it's still a racial remark, you know.
*  Especially if you're cracking on white people.
*  You could crack on white people as hard as you want right now.
*  It's great.
*  Which is so vague too.
*  I don't know if this is a smart idea or not, but it's something I always think is like it's so vague.
*  These shitty comics like Hari Konda Bulu are like white people, white people.
*  What white people?
*  Which ones?
*  French?
*  Canadian?
*  Do Jews count?
*  Croatian?
*  What a great lump you've done.
*  All white?
*  You know how many countries that covers?
*  And then you go, well, that's why we're saying it because we don't mean a specific country.
*  We're talking about a, but then so then that's racist.
*  You go, well, white's not a race.
*  It's just a color of the, well, then how come black is a race?
*  Because black would be Haiti.
*  It would be tons of parts of Africa.
*  You know, so I guess my point is like then it's not racist when I say black.
*  If it's not racist when you say white because you're over-glamming the big thing.
*  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
*  Also, how much do white people vary?
*  There's so many white people.
*  They vary so much.
*  It's so vague.
*  To just say white men like, oh God.
*  Oh, you must be rich because you're white.
*  You're like, do you know how many poor white people there are?
*  Go to Kentucky.
*  Most of them are poor.
*  Yeah, go to where the fucking coal mines are.
*  Those coal mining communities where people have just been popping pills since the 80s.
*  Meth?
*  Yeah.
*  You never heard of white trash?
*  Like we dominate the poor community.
*  Have you ever seen the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia?
*  Yeah, dude.
*  Jessica White.
*  Fucking amazing.
*  Those dancing skills.
*  Didn't Johnny Knoxville produce that?
*  That's how I saw it.
*  It was, I don't know if it was Johnny Knoxville, but Jack Hole Productions or whatever it was.
*  I think Knoxville made that.
*  It's fucking incredible.
*  Oh, amazing.
*  But that's white people too.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, these poor white people are, they're just victims of their environment, man.
*  They're teaching college kids that like if you're a straight white guy, they just hand you suitcases full of money and that you have no troubles and the cops don't target you.
*  It's like cops.
*  You see what Trump said today?
*  I'll send this to you, Jamie, because this is wild.
*  This is a wild move.
*  I'll send this to you, Jamie.
*  It is what he said about colleges.
*  Oh, I love it.
*  And DEI endowments.
*  I love it.
*  I'll send this to you, Jamie.
*  He's doing so much crazy shit because he only has one term.
*  You know, like all the different things that he said so far about completely banning all of these gender transition clinics for kids.
*  Hormone therapies for kids.
*  Puberty blockers for kids.
*  Like stop that.
*  And you know, and he even called them out for the expression gender affirming kids.
*  It's a crazy like a literal dystopian euphemism for what you're doing.
*  And he said Marxist multiple times.
*  Yeah.
*  And people are going to go, they're not Marxist.
*  Do you know BLM self-proclaimed themselves as Marxists?
*  Yeah.
*  So you can find hundreds of times where they say we are Marxists.
*  Yeah.
*  So before anybody comments, well, they're not really they've called themselves the Marxists.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  I think a lot of people like blanketly support that just because it seems like a smart idea.
*  Yeah.
*  Black Lives Matter.
*  Of course they do.
*  Yeah.
*  There's cops have killed people.
*  We've seen it.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  It's definitely good to support that.
*  Sure.
*  Then you find out all the other stuff behind it and then you find out that the people that were running it were buying real estate.
*  Do a little homework.
*  They gave all your money to trans people.
*  They didn't help the black community at all.
*  Is not only going to tax but confiscate endowments of every university the Department of Justice finds has engaged in illegal discrimination under the guise of equity,
*  which is basically every university in the country,
*  but it's especially true with the Ivy League,
*  which is if this happens will die they will crush.
*  Oh, okay.
*  But this is you know who suffers the most from this discrimination from discrimination is Asian people.
*  Do you know why?
*  Because Asian people score so high and they work so hard.
*  They make it more difficult for them to get it.
*  They have to have higher grades and they have to have a higher score.
*  They like they score them based on like social interaction.
*  Which is crazy.
*  Which if you're studying 18 hours a day like a lot of these Asian.
*  I'm going to win.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's their culture.
*  Their culture is this like nose to the grindstone hard work discipline culture.
*  I had a buddy.
*  And no one in America is mad at them for succeeding.
*  We encourage it.
*  It's good.
*  I had a buddy of mine that was a national taekwondo champion while he was going through his medical residency.
*  He was Korean and his father no matter what he did this guy won the nationals.
*  He was the national taekwondo champion and he wasn't like talented either.
*  It wasn't like he was hard work.
*  It was a hundred percent hard work.
*  Yeah, and this fucking guy like would work all day long at school and then put his books in his backpack and walk upstairs to get a workout.
*  I love it.
*  He would just do flights of stairs over and over while he was at school because he had to do something and then go back to school.
*  One of the fucking nationals like that.
*  And that's beautiful.
*  It's this kind of crazy work ethic that some Asian households instill in their children.
*  And it's tough to compete with them.
*  So what they've done is they've there's been lawsuits about it.
*  I believe Harvard was sued.
*  Right.
*  Was Harvard sued that they were discriminating against Asian Americans?
*  So they have like ways that what they're saying is what they were complaining was that there's ways that they have that like accentuate certain attributes like that lets you get in like think social things that you do different things you do that give you extra points.
*  So they felt like was designed just to keep less Asian people in like crazy to push some of them out because so many of them were getting in there and dominating.
*  Yeah, dominating the fucking.
*  Yeah, but that's great.
*  Yes.
*  Well, this is if you come from the best of the best how a hardworking household and you develop that work ethic you can you might not be happy.
*  That's part of the problem.
*  Well, I like that they complain about their tiger moms and you're like, dude, they made you successful.
*  Right.
*  You got to figure out how to be happy.
*  Right.
*  That's up for you to do.
*  This is it.
*  The lawsuit a threat to what happened an organization created by anti-race conscious admissions activist Edward Blum citing itself students for fair admissions sued Harvard alleging that the university discriminates against Asian Americans.
*  And seeking to prevent Harvard College and other colleges and universities from using a wide ranging and thorough admissions process that considers the whole person.
*  Love that.
*  Interesting.
*  So this this that's interesting though because on paper that sounds like a good thing a wide ranging and thorough admissions process that considers the whole person like if you want to educate a child.
*  Right.
*  You want a kid to go from being a young teenager to being an adult and you're educating them.
*  There is a social aspect to it.
*  Right.
*  Like you don't want to develop like complete sociopaths that just go to work.
*  But you can't also you can't like stop that option.
*  Like there's people want a quality of outcomes a very important point.
*  But there's not a quality of effort.
*  It just isn't.
*  And in the mad dog race of life you're occasionally going to get a Michael Jordan.
*  You're going to get a guy who works harder than everybody and he's gifted and he's going to exceed he's going to pass you on and there's nothing you can do about it.
*  Nothing you do about Mike Tyson when he was 22 years old.
*  Get the fuck out of the way.
*  Pick up tennis.
*  Yeah.
*  He's going to kill you.
*  He's going to be number two.
*  Maybe you want to be number two.
*  You're eventually going to get to have fight number one and that's not going to be a lot of fun.
*  You heard the world's not fair.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And that guy when you saw the way he trained when he was young man, he trained like a person possessed.
*  He lived in what hard work all day.
*  He was obsessed with fighting.
*  It's all he had and talented and gifted.
*  So if you have those things all together, the world is not fair.
*  And you can't make it fair with laws and you can't make it fair with rules.
*  And it doesn't make you any better to suppress someone in some sort of a way by diminishing their success.
*  And that includes someone who's a fucking complete psychopath who studies 18 hours a day and dominates and starts a business when they're 19.
*  It becomes a billionaire by the time they're 26.
*  And then all of a sudden, you know, buys Twitter from Elon Musk.
*  You can't stop that.
*  Ask one of these crazy people who doesn't understand these kind of things or has never even thought of it.
*  Say, oh, you know, you're watching.
*  I noticed you're watching the WNBA game.
*  Do you think it's unfair that Britney Griner makes more than her teammates and they'll go, no, she's the best.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  That's the same.
*  Just like anyone else, that's the best.
*  That's the best.
*  Makes more money.
*  How can you understand that Britney Griner makes more than her teammates, but you can't understand that the NBA generates more money and is better, makes more than the WNBA.
*  How can you in brain...
*  Well, what people get scared of is the amount of control and power that you have with that kind of money.
*  And then some people want to make decisions for all of us, like Bill Gates.
*  Like one of the wackiest ones, he's talking about blocking the sun, putting particles in the sky to block the sun, to cool the earth.
*  Like, hey, fuckhead, there's a whole lot of people on earth.
*  You don't get to say for all of us, you don't talk for all of us just because you have a hundred billion dollars.
*  That's crazy talk.
*  Right.
*  That's what people are scared of.
*  What people are scared of is that when you really do have ultimate money and ultimate power with most people, there's this desire to control people.
*  It's part of the gig.
*  And some of them, when they decide they don't want to go into politics, they start influencing things behind the scenes.
*  They start donating.
*  They have funds.
*  They have a giant fund and their fund donates to all these different organizations.
*  And Bill Gates' case, it prevented them from criticizing him because the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they donate all this money.
*  These media corporations and all these companies, look at all the money they've given you to help global health and whatever the fuck it is.
*  What it really does is it buys off people from criticizing.
*  100%.
*  And then you start doing wild shit like telling everybody they should eat plant-based food.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking buy all the farmland.
*  Yeah.
*  You start controlling people.
*  It's like people like to pull strings on people.
*  The George Soros's of the world.
*  Scares me so much.
*  Get DA's elected and then put an even more progressive DA to go in after him and see if he can fuck with things by letting people out of jail and defunding the cops.
*  It's like they're playing these weird Monopoly games with the whole world.
*  You know where you saw it, a great example was when Barack Obama got into office, Michelle Obama's whole thing was like nutrition.
*  That was what she was going to really work on.
*  And dude, it was almost like after two weeks, someone brought her in the bag and was like, listen bitch.
*  We hear what you're saying about the food industry.
*  I don't know if you know how much bread we're putting in your husband's pockets.
*  And then she immediately was like, maybe fitness.
*  Maybe your kids could run around 10 minutes a day.
*  How about that? Is that better?
*  She gave up the food service.
*  What about the food stuff? It just was immediately.
*  What is that Jamie?
*  Is that the same thing?
*  No, I didn't have it muted.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  But then it was like all of it, all the focus went towards, hey, just 10 minutes a day.
*  Have your kids go outside and play.
*  It was all the food stuff gone.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And you realize, oh, there are other things.
*  You know, there's like all these other things that are at play.
*  It's not just other things.
*  It's billions and billions of dollars.
*  When you're that far ahead of the game, you know, if you're playing a game and you cannot,
*  you cannot beat the game, there's no way to beat it.
*  You're on level one.
*  There's a million levels.
*  The people that have been playing it that you're playing against,
*  they've been playing for 30 years.
*  They have all the armor.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  All the magic spells.
*  You're not going to win that game.
*  And that is what people are really scared about with people who have a lot of money,
*  is that they don't just have a boat.
*  They don't just have a house.
*  But then they start influencing what people can and can't do.
*  Then they start funding studies to talk about particular types of energy
*  because they've got an enormous amount of money invested in this green renewable energy
*  or whatever it is.
*  But what it really is, is money.
*  They're not ever doing anything for you, ever.
*  Whether it's climate change or whatever the, whether it's energy, it's always money.
*  And they'll flavor it.
*  Yeah.
*  With, it's for you.
*  It's for us.
*  Right.
*  We have to worry about the environment.
*  We have to.
*  Didn't Al Gore become the first guy to make a billion dollars off of climate change?
*  I know he's definitely the face of it for a long time.
*  But I read that, that Al Gore, it could be bullshit,
*  but I read that Al Gore was the first climate change billionaire.
*  Interesting.
*  And that the things that he invested in, that movie that he put out that scared the fuck out of me.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  We're all like, we got to do something.
*  Yeah, I saw that.
*  By the way, not a single thing, not a single thing was accurate, not even close.
*  Yeah.
*  Not even close.
*  Might as well have been made by Michael Moore.
*  Might as well have just been.
*  Michael Moore is more accurate.
*  He was, at least back in the day.
*  Yeah.
*  You watch Roger and Me.
*  Michael Moore, in the early days, made some great films.
*  Well, like, I think a lot of it was just bullcrap.
*  Well, not the first one, not Roger and Me.
*  Remember when he like, he did a scene where like, these kids go into a bank
*  and they buy a gun over the counter from the bank.
*  And I was like, yeah, it was a, his gun one, bowling for Columbine or whatever.
*  Right.
*  And I remember seeing that scene as like, I worked at Hollywood Video at the time,
*  and I was like, this is terrifying.
*  We got to get rid of these guns.
*  And then I looked into it years later when the internet kind of grew,
*  and I was like, oh, total bullshit.
*  It was like a made-up scene.
*  Made up a scene?
*  Yeah, which that's why we weren't even allowed at Hollywood Video
*  to keep Michael Moore's movies in the documentary section.
*  We weren't even allowed to keep it in that section.
*  Really?
*  Because it's not counted as a documentary.
*  Oh, see, it didn't used to be like that.
*  I kind of, I've got to be honest.
*  I don't think I watched Bowling for Columbine.
*  I might have, it was so long ago.
*  But I do remember Roger and Me being very impactful
*  because it was about the auto industry moving out of Flint, Michigan.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  And about how the town collapsed.
*  It happened in Pittsburgh.
*  I was just in Pittsburgh,
*  and you see all these abandoned warehouses where Americans used to work.
*  Yeah.
*  And you go, oh, wasn't it better with Chinese slaves making you $300 sneakers?
*  Like, no, it's not better.
*  It's not better at all.
*  It's not better for anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy what they did, and they just did it for money.
*  They did it for money.
*  They shipped over things overseas
*  because they can get people to work for nothing, which is so crazy.
*  I know.
*  That you can't do it here, but you do it there.
*  That's why.
*  I was talking to this person who ran a plant in Mexico.
*  We were getting a little tipsy.
*  And I didn't like that they were justifying this procedure of doing that.
*  And they were trying to tell me that these people would starve to death
*  if it wasn't for that plant.
*  I go, those people have been there for thousands of years.
*  Yeah.
*  I go, and you know why they don't have any money?
*  Probably because we bribed their government.
*  Right.
*  And we gave them loans they couldn't pay off.
*  And then we took all their resources.
*  And then we moved plants over.
*  And the pollution of the plants is just insane, too.
*  They live in fog-filled cities.
*  We can go back to the entire areas run by the cartel
*  because we have drugs illegal in this country,
*  unless they're prescribed.
*  And then you have the Sackler family that makes billions of dollars.
*  What about all this?
*  Nobody's worried about that slavery.
*  Everyone wants to talk about slavery that we abolished in this country.
*  Everyone wants to talk about that slavery.
*  But not a slave that made your phone.
*  But not the current slavery that made this.
*  Or my shoes, or all the things you wear.
*  Or how about the sex trafficking?
*  How about the women that are slaves right now?
*  Well, how about the amount of them that have probably been smuggled across the border?
*  We don't even know what those numbers are.
*  If I put together enough money, right?
*  I'm not super rich, but I've got some money.
*  If I put together, like my life mission is to fix that,
*  they'd just kill me in a month.
*  They'd go, hey, what are you doing, dude?
*  Tell jokes and talk about baseball.
*  Why are you trying to help in something that matters?
*  Yeah, man, just trying to shut down the cartel.
*  And you live in a normal house.
*  I'd make it a week.
*  We wouldn't let you go, what happened to Jeff?
*  That's a billion dollar a month business.
*  The fuck are you talking about?
*  They're not going to let you get away with that.
*  They're going to kill you.
*  They kill everybody.
*  Why wouldn't they kill you?
*  So you've got all these problems.
*  And then shipping things, shipping these factories to these other places,
*  it doesn't keep you from starving to death.
*  It's just we were doing an unethical thing.
*  Like you can't do it on this patch of dirt.
*  But if you just move it to that patch of dirt,
*  now you can do unethical things.
*  Now it's fine.
*  This is crazy.
*  What is this, a casino cruise ship?
*  Not only that, like now that we know.
*  So they did that back then when there was no internet.
*  You sneak it across the board.
*  Nobody, I'm still buying.
*  Oh, my car is $5 cheaper.
*  And you don't care.
*  And so everybody, you hear some stories about Michigan.
*  If you don't live there, hey, whatever, I'm over here in LA.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  I got a nice car.
*  But your car is made in Mexico.
*  And it's like we don't even realize what the impact of that
*  was.
*  But now that we have the internet, now you can see it.
*  And we still do it.
*  It's like it's grandfathered in that you buy your phone
*  from a company that uses slaves.
*  100%.
*  And the factories literally have nets around them
*  to keep people from jumping off.
*  And we're like, OK.
*  And also, I'm not pretending I'm better than anyone else.
*  I promise that.
*  But I don't yammer on on my social media about slavery
*  all day.
*  I'm aware that I'm in this system or this network.
*  It's just so hypocritical when I hear LeBron talk about slavery
*  that happened in our country over 100 years ago
*  while he's dripping in Nike.
*  How dumb can you be to pretend to care about slavery
*  while you're making, what, a billion or something
*  from Nike over the?
*  Don't you think that if you are a person that
*  is in mainstream world acceptance,
*  whether a sports star or any kind of media personality,
*  there's certain things you feel obligated to call out
*  and to talk about.
*  I would think so.
*  I only know how I would behave.
*  And I just think there's honest money
*  and then there's dishonest money.
*  And I've never had the stomach for it.
*  You mean like the money they paid the people
*  to endorse Kamaheros?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's pretty dishonest money right there.
*  Cardi B, Beyonce.
*  Did you know that was even legal?
*  You fucking fools.
*  Did you know that was even legal?
*  It shouldn't be legal.
*  The View keeps yammering about how Elon Musk shouldn't be allowed.
*  I saw a video yesterday about you.
*  The Joe Rogans of the world are influencing.
*  Oh, that's that feminist guy?
*  And they're so mad.
*  He tried to say that there's this multi-billion dollar
*  right-wing ecosystem that's been developed,
*  just like a terrorist network that radicalizes young people.
*  What, by talking to scientists?
*  By telling them to be good guys?
*  To tell them to be honorable to their partner?
*  Radicalizes.
*  That's not radical.
*  Radicalizes.
*  Also, let me ask you, on air for this podcast,
*  how much money did Donald Trump give you to endorse him?
*  $100 million.
*  No, he didn't.
*  He gave me nothing.
*  He gave you zero, Joe.
*  He gave me nothing.
*  He gave you zero because you thought,
*  I think that this is what's best for the country,
*  given the two options.
*  I know.
*  I knew the resistance that it would face,
*  but I think it's true.
*  How much did Beyonce get?
*  She had $10 million.
*  $10 million?
*  But hold on.
*  She talked for like three minutes.
*  That's good.
*  What do you mean that's good?
*  I mean, that's enough.
*  That's too much.
*  No.
*  No, it's plenty.
*  It's perfect.
*  $10 million.
*  It's a good deal, the taxpayers' money.
*  I mean, it's a good deal, all these people that are like
*  donating money to the Democratic Party.
*  And they're $20 million.
*  It went to Beyonce.
*  You mutants.
*  They're $20 million.
*  They spent a billion dollars.
*  They're $20 million in debt.
*  And Trump offered to pay their debt.
*  He's like, we have a lot of money left over
*  because most of our media was called earned media.
*  I had to look it up.
*  So earned media is essentially whenever he's in the news
*  or when he's getting interviewed on shows or on podcasts.
*  That's earned media.
*  And that's what he did.
*  Well, I just love...
*  People go, why are you getting so passionate about this, Jeff?
*  It's like it's right in front of your eyes.
*  Right.
*  You have to pay someone $10 million to endorse A,
*  but then like B is doing it for free
*  because they believe in that idea.
*  Which one seems more nefarious?
*  Bro, Eminem took $1.8 million.
*  $1.8 million?
*  How do we know that's true?
*  Because I said it.
*  I read it in the news.
*  I have not found any evidence that supports this stuff.
*  I think it's all legit.
*  Including some of them being asked and said I was not paid.
*  But wait a minute.
*  Oprah was paid.
*  There was an FEC thing.
*  Her company was paid to host an event.
*  Okay.
*  They paid her company a million dollars, dude.
*  I'm just saying that's...
*  Right.
*  I don't know what happened and where they hosted it
*  and how people were involved.
*  She was not paid.
*  A million dollars?
*  What did she do that hosted an event?
*  Did she put together an event like cater an event?
*  Campaign finance.
*  I'll try to put it on the screen.
*  Show that they paid Harpo productions for event production.
*  It was paid for live streaming event.
*  Which I don't know how much that costs.
*  Production costs of a live stream event.
*  That could be money.
*  Since she was not paid a personal fee for the event,
*  she said I was paid nothing.
*  Right.
*  But she didn't donate her company to do this.
*  She got paid for it.
*  That's right.
*  I don't know if they put out...
*  So this is where I got it.
*  So she got a gig is essentially what it is.
*  She got a million dollar gig.
*  Five million to Megan Thee Stallion.
*  Three million to Lizzo.
*  1.8 for Eminem.
*  I know that's in this article, but it doesn't show where...
*  And one million for Oprah.
*  That could be made up.
*  Okay.
*  This is an Instagram list.
*  Well, I didn't make it up, but that's what I read.
*  I love it.
*  I want it to be real.
*  Okay, no problem.
*  I want it to be real.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it makes me believe in our Earth better if they didn't,
*  if they just did it for free.
*  It makes me believe in the Earth better if they did it,
*  because I don't want to think that Eminem really believed that shit.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  It's always naughty people that do this.
*  I wouldn't think you went out there for 1.8.
*  It says that there's no records.
*  There's no federal records showing campaign payments to Eminem or Megan Thee Stallion.
*  So when it says mostly false, where did that rumor emanate from?
*  Someone put it on Instagram, and it goes around.
*  People run wild with it, because it sounds fun.
*  Damn.
*  I thought it was fun.
*  Yeah, it is fun.
*  If I'm wrong, I'm willing to, you know.
*  I read it, and my blood boiled.
*  I was like, what is going on?
*  The Beyonce one is crazy.
*  There's no evidence that it's true.
*  It might be true.
*  It doesn't mean it's not.
*  Just no current evidence.
*  No current evidence.
*  It's mostly false, but this is politifact.
*  Yeah, it could be a rumor that got spread.
*  Politifact is sketch.
*  Well, if it's not true, then it's not true.
*  But let me tell you, if it is true, that's crazy.
*  Is that legal?
*  Crazy.
*  Is that legal?
*  Is it legal to pay Beyonce $10 million to talk at a political rally?
*  I don't think so.
*  There's all these little companies.
*  Why would they pay her that much?
*  That seems crazy.
*  That does seem crazy.
*  Desperate times.
*  Yeah, but she doesn't need the money.
*  No, I'm saying desperate times for the campaign trail.
*  And then they go, I was going to endorse her anyways.
*  I'll just do it for a little fee.
*  My time is worth money.
*  My private plane costs money.
*  Can you cover that?
*  Well, it seems suspicious.
*  Because when someone's got that kind of money, to do something that people are going to look down upon if they find out if it's true, that's what makes me skeptical.
*  Because someone who has that kind of money, for her, $10 million, it sounds crazy to say this, but I believe that for Beyonce and Jay-Z, $10 million is not noticeable.
*  It's not going to change their life at all.
*  It won't change their life, but you still notice.
*  I think they're billionaires, dude.
*  Beyonce's got almost a billion dollars.
*  Yeah, I think he has a billion as well.
*  I don't think they're going to notice.
*  So that's not going to change your lifestyle.
*  But it could get you out of your house to go do a thing that puts you in the news.
*  Is that what she wants?
*  Well, think about the Super Bowl.
*  All those people that perform in the Super Bowl halftime get paid $0.
*  Right, but it's a tremendous advertisement.
*  Because they do it.
*  But they perform.
*  She wasn't even performing.
*  She was just talking.
*  I mean, maybe $10 million is $10 million.
*  You can't help it even if you've got $2 billion in the bank.
*  But part of me is like, maybe I'm just looking at how I would look at it.
*  Like, I wouldn't do shit.
*  I wouldn't do nothing.
*  Well, I always think, and this may be my naivety to rich people,
*  is that they don't have to be bought anymore because they're rich.
*  You'd think that.
*  That's how I think about it.
*  Is that I wouldn't do anything against...
*  It's easier to do things against my moral compass when I was broke.
*  You'd say, Jeff, we'll give you $500, go steal this thing.
*  Because I'd be like, I need $500.
*  Whereas now I can be a little more generous with my money.
*  I can be a little more ethical because I'm in a place where I don't have to worry about it.
*  The $500 isn't worth breaking some ethical code for me.
*  Right. But money isn't your existence.
*  For some people, money is some score of how well they're doing in life.
*  And they get addicted to numbers.
*  They get addicted to this idea of constantly...
*  It's growing.
*  Yeah. And they compare themselves to all the other people.
*  This is from Fox News.
*  They have Washington Examiner reporting that money was spent in ways,
*  I guess you could argue, maybe...
*  Well, they spent six figures building the set for Call Her Daddy.
*  But that seems...
*  That's a million.
*  People are saying that's outrageous, but that's not that outrageous.
*  $100,000. You build a set, you have to lease a building,
*  you have to bring in cameras and all that shit.
*  I could see that being $100,000.
*  Campaign spent at least $15 million on event production,
*  FEC Record Show, with many payments lining up with high-profile events
*  and concerts with celebrity attendees or performers.
*  And that's how you do it, because it's a performance.
*  So you pay them for performing.
*  That's the difference.
*  That's the difference.
*  The truth is, just an epic disaster.
*  This is a $1 billion disaster.
*  Lindy Lee, Harris Surrogate, and DNC National Finance Committee member
*  told Fox and Friends Weekend on Saturday.
*  So they did. They definitely spent a lot of money.
*  Harris' campaign cut multiple six-figure paychecks in September
*  for left-leaning groups that have been vocal about defunding the police,
*  reparations that are tied to radical activists who have supported
*  notorious anti-Semi Lewis Farrakhan, Fox News digitally, previously reported.
*  That's wild.
*  So they cut checks to left-leaning groups.
*  So they spend money to get people to talk about things.
*  They give it to the groups.
*  The groups pay the performers and the people that speak.
*  Also, the groups, you're paying them to be vocal.
*  By saying, cut multiple six-figure checks,
*  you're funding these people to go out and do these things.
*  The FEC camp filings also spent north of $56 million on payroll and payroll taxes
*  in just three months.
*  That's crazy.
*  That payroll is your performers.
*  Filings also show the campaign gave in excess of $100 million to various
*  consulting and marketing firms, including Gambit Strategies, LLC,
*  DuPont Circle Strategies, LLC, and Bully Pulpit Interactive, LLC.
*  That is so crazy.
*  They gave those folks $100 million.
*  Yeah, so like $1 million to M&M could have been lost in there,
*  but I'm just saying that you have to find the evidence to blame them.
*  I think with a guy like M&M, too, he doesn't like performing.
*  He has agoraphobia.
*  He doesn't like leaving the house, which is crazy.
*  I saw him.
*  He killed it.
*  I saw him over here at the racetrack.
*  He played at COTA.
*  Yeah, it was awesome.
*  It was like 100,000 people were there because it was,
*  I don't know what the real number is.
*  I might have made that up, but a lot of people.
*  A lot of people.
*  Because people were there for Formula One, and they have this enormous place.
*  Like I saw the Stones there, and I think it was, I mean, how many people's COTA seat?
*  I mean, it had to be 80,000 people.
*  It's one of the biggest crowds I've ever seen.
*  It was insane.
*  This F1 star is taking off.
*  But I saw M&M there.
*  He was great, but he performed so rarely.
*  My buddy was at an F1 thing recently and had one of the concerts that was performing afterwards or something.
*  Maybe it was just F1.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe there wasn't a concert.
*  Whatever it was, Michael Jordan was just hanging out.
*  Michael Jordan had a hat on, a hood on.
*  He had the things over his ears from the noise of the car.
*  And my buddy's like, hey, man.
*  And then Jordan took a selfie with them, chatted them up for a few minutes.
*  And I was like, that's how popular it's getting.
*  You said that M&M was performing at an F1 thing?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, he performed at the races.
*  And then one night he performed.
*  That's crazy.
*  I think he performed Sunday night or Saturday night.
*  I just saw Post Malone there, too.
*  He was just there two weeks ago doing his country show.
*  Yeah.
*  He's doing...
*  I love that.
*  It's great.
*  I love that dude.
*  Post the best.
*  He's so much fun.
*  He's such a fun dude, too.
*  Just fun to hang out with him, too.
*  Get to see him and give him a hug.
*  100,000.
*  100,000 people.
*  100,000.
*  So it was just an insane huge crowd.
*  He killed it, too.
*  I love that.
*  But he doesn't like to do shows.
*  So to get him out there for a political event, you gotta come with the cheddar.
*  Yeah, you better pay the guy.
*  You gotta come with the cheddar.
*  Especially if he doesn't do a lot of shows a year.
*  1.8 will go a long way.
*  Guy lives in Detroit.
*  Pretty easy.
*  Price of living there is not that steep.
*  Yeah.
*  I also think that people care about money.
*  Yeah, well, especially if you're a person who thinks about money all the time.
*  That's what I was saying about...
*  I know rich dudes.
*  I know dudes who are billionaires who get uncomfortable when they're around 100 billionaires.
*  Because they feel like losers.
*  That's wild.
*  It's hilarious.
*  It breaks my brain.
*  It's like when you showed me all the planets in a row and I was going, oh, that's what
*  you just did with money.
*  Yeah.
*  There's always layers to it.
*  I'm pretty wealthy, but I'm very poor compared to my friend, Elon.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm a pauper.
*  I'm like a dude living in a shitty studio apartment compared to that guy.
*  That's what it's like.
*  I don't know.
*  There's crazy levels to it.
*  But also, he works in a way I am not willing to do.
*  He doesn't sleep.
*  That's one thing people don't talk about these really.
*  Even Bill Gates, whether you agree with him or not, the dude was willing to sleep like
*  a fish where he'd sleep for 15 minutes and wake up and program again.
*  He worked really hard to become Bill Gates.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There's no doubt.
*  And without Microsoft, who knows where we'd be without the Windows operating system.
*  Oh, my God.
*  It was fucking everywhere.
*  It was everything.
*  He's also cured like 500 things.
*  These small little nonprofits will say, well, there's this disease called this.
*  You go, how much you need?
*  They go, a million bucks, we think, maybe.
*  And then he just gives them a money, and then they close.
*  They go, well, what are we going to work on now?
*  He cured it.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Sure about that?
*  Well, that's what I've ... Is this another one of these ones I got wrong?
*  Yeah, it might be one of these ones.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's ask you, Bill, you just put in ...
*  There's a thing called philanthrop capitalism.
*  Okay.
*  Philanthrocapitalism is you're acting like a philanthropist, but you're making a lot of
*  money through this.
*  He invested a lot of money in the mRNA vaccines, and that's why he was promoting it.
*  And he made like $500 million.
*  Sure, sure.
*  And then after he dumped his stock, he started talking shit about it.
*  It wasn't really that good.
*  The virus wasn't that dangerous.
*  Like, what?
*  Yeah.
*  Where was this guy?
*  Well, but I'm saying all these ... I don't know how to look up if he's cured any diseases
*  or anything.
*  I don't know how you'd look that up.
*  Is there a way to look that up?
*  I think they invested in efforts to develop cures for diseases.
*  For sure.
*  They've also invested in pharmaceuticals.
*  But they didn't fix it.
*  No, no.
*  The only one I know that's close, I think, is sickle cell, but I think they just pulled
*  back to those drugs.
*  We would have heard about that if they cured sickle cell.
*  You know where sickle cell came from?
*  I thought that he cured all these small ones.
*  You know where sickle cell came from?
*  No.
*  It came from resistance to malaria.
*  Really?
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Yeah, the people that experience malaria that's tracked down in their genes and they pass
*  it on to their ancestors.
*  That's where sickle ... I had a buddy of mine.
*  He died from sickle cell.
*  When I was a kid, a guy I used to do taekwondo with, a dude named Walter, was an awesomely
*  talented guy.
*  But he would get real sick, man.
*  He just couldn't train, couldn't come in for months.
*  Yeah, there was a new drug that came out this year, I think, that they thought was going
*  to be ending it, but they had to quickly pull it off.
*  Brought to you by Pfizer.
*  Some people died.
*  Of course.
*  They died from it?
*  Yeah, anticipated number, higher than an anticipated number of deaths reported in trials.
*  Yeah.
*  Indicating the benefits of the drug no longer outweighed the risks.
*  So it kills people quicker than sickle cell.
*  I guess that's a solution of sorts.
*  There's been so many of those drugs.
*  You know 33%, is that what it is?
*  30-something percent of all drugs the FDA approves get pulled.
*  They're like, whoopsies.
*  We tried.
*  Yeah, we tried.
*  What's the matter?
*  You ever read that book?
*  I think it's called like 19 ... I don't know the name of the book.
*  It's named after a year.
*  1984?
*  1984?
*  Not the George Orwell book.
*  No, not George Orwell.
*  It's called ...
*  That would be ridiculous.
*  Gosh.
*  It's a ...
*  What's it about?
*  I'm trying to look in my audible for this book.
*  But basically the premise is this guy cures cancer.
*  Why don't you search and type in the number 19?
*  Maybe.
*  But it might be called 2020.
*  You don't remember?
*  No.
*  I listened to a lot of books.
*  What's it called again?
*  I'll find it.
*  But the premise is this guy cures cancer.
*  And at first everyone's great.
*  He becomes the richest guy in the world.
*  Everyone's happy that he cured cancer.
*  But then people start to resent him because they're like, I should have already had my
*  inheritance by now.
*  This guy's playing God, keeping my parents alive longer than they should.
*  It becomes these ideas of like, no, he's wrong for doing this.
*  He's affected society.
*  There's no real estate being freed up as quick now.
*  You should just die however they die naturally.
*  And it's a fun little ...
*  It's just a novel.
*  Yeah.
*  It's obviously not real or nothing, but it was an interesting kind of way to look at
*  things.
*  Well, that's a sociopath's way of looking at things.
*  Imagine that.
*  What you're thinking is if someone dies, I get their stuff.
*  Why don't they just die?
*  It's disgusting.
*  But I could see how groups would start to think that.
*  That's how life is.
*  You do a good idea.
*  Look at the systems that we put in place back in the day and now everyone looks like, that
*  was just their way to trap people in the projects.
*  You're like, at first it was a really nice idea.
*  They wanted to give people that couldn't afford places in the city, but it's all been ...
*  That's how people react to that one dude is trying to live to be 2,000 years old.
*  That one guy who gets young guys' blood injected in his body and doing different things.
*  I've seen so many people mad at him.
*  If everybody lived 500 years, the whole world would be overcrowded.
*  Yeah.
*  But everyone's not trying to do it.
*  Also, if I could give you a pill and you would be healthy ... Just take this one pill.
*  You'll be healthy for 150 years.
*  You're not going to take it?
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  It's called 2030 by Albert Brooks.
*  Oh, okay.
*  2030.
*  That's interesting.
*  Good book?
*  Yeah, because you start to see how over time people just misconstrue things.
*  Enough time goes by.
*  People are willing to do all sorts of mental gymnastics.
*  That's how this whole gender-affirming care thing got through.
*  We would never let kids get tattoos.
*  We were letting them get their dicks chopped off.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Says who?
*  Why?
*  What, 30 years ago, if you said that we'd be debating or even having to have a conversation
*  that's controversial about whether a guy can be a woman, they would laugh in the streets
*  at us.
*  Yeah.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  Now it's real.
*  That's how the book does a really good job of describing ... They would just resent that
*  guy after a while.
*  They would hate him for carrying cancer.
*  Some people would.
*  There's always going to be weak bitches in this world.
*  They exist.
*  Just like you're talking about your parents, I don't want to be like that.
*  That's what weak bitches are there for.
*  Their weak behavior, jealous behavior.
*  You learn from it.
*  You go, oh, okay.
*  I see what that guy's doing.
*  I don't ever want to be like that guy.
*  I feel like that with a ton of people in my life right now.
*  Hell yeah.
*  You're going to always ... They're there.
*  They're always going to be there.
*  Some people, they're not going to keep up, and you can't keep them in your life either.
*  You just can't.
*  You got to keep moving.
*  Some people are never going to run out of problems, and they're never going to run out
*  of friends to throw those problems at.
*  I was telling you this earlier, but the day after the election, I woke up.
*  I was with my buddies.
*  I was just sitting there, and I was about to open up my phone for the first time since
*  Trump wins the election.
*  I just took a deep breath.
*  I was like, I'm going to lose a lot of friends today.
*  I was about to post some shit, and I was so ...
*  You're not losing friends though.
*  You're losing friends that weren't really your friends.
*  We're friends with conditions.
*  Ron White is a giant Kamala Harris supporter, believe it or not.
*  Ron White always votes blue.
*  He's one of them low information voters.
*  You start giving him facts, he falls apart, but he'll fucking tell you, that guy shouldn't
*  be the fucking president.
*  He's like ...
*  He's a good president.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I love him to death.
*  He's one of my best friends.
*  I don't care.
*  That's how things should work.
*  That's how it's supposed to work.
*  He's 100% ...
*  He has different political ideas.
*  He has different ways of thinking about things.
*  That's fine.
*  It broke my heart that a lot of people have treated me the way ...
*  Because I feel like people were fine with conservative Jeff.
*  They knew that I'm a Christian, and that I lean right, and especially now lean even more
*  right.
*  They didn't really draw a line until I became supportive of Donald Trump.
*  That's when they drew a line, and they go, we don't want to talk to you anymore.
*  I don't think I move ...
*  And that broke my heart.
*  I don't think I move right at all.
*  I stayed.
*  But the whole thing moved.
*  The whole thing has moved.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  I haven't changed many of my thoughts.
*  It's just that it's gone ... What was a Democrat is now Republican.
*  There's a few of my thoughts that I used to be all in on, and now I'm like, hmm.
*  This is just about human psychology.
*  I was all in on universal basic income, which I think is going to be necessary in the future,
*  because I think automation ... It's something Andrew Yang talked about when he was running
*  for president.
*  I think he's correct.
*  That automation and AI is going to just consume so many ... Especially AI.
*  It's going to consume so many jobs.
*  There's going to be so many people that have to rethink their life and figure it out.
*  I think if we don't compensate those people somehow or another, we're going to have a
*  real fucking chaotic problem on our hands.
*  Just to keep people happy and healthy, I think universal basic income might be the way to
*  go.
*  But I used to always think, hey, maybe if we gave universal basic income to people,
*  then they would still be ambitious, but they'd be ambitious in pursuing their own career,
*  or developing their own business, or taking that money and using it to be free.
*  Now I think that human nature, if you give people ... There's so many people that if
*  you don't give them a difficult problem to solve, and if you provide them with all their
*  needs, their food, and their shelter, they just get lazy.
*  100%.
*  Which is what you don't like.
*  There's two things going on simultaneously.
*  One, we have to address the fact that there is no way to get around the fact that automation
*  and AI is going to consume a lot of jobs.
*  I think universal basic income is probably the only solution for some of those people.
*  Then there's also the psychology aspect of it.
*  If you do tell people you never have to work again, most people never have to work again,
*  and they're going to regret it someday.
*  One day they're going to look at all these people they admire that have accomplished
*  things that live these fun, exciting lives, successful lives, and they're going to fear
*  envy, and they're going to feel despair, and they're going to feel like they could have
*  done something more with their life.
*  But they got trapped.
*  The siren song of comfort led them into the rocks.
*  That's the devil, the comfort.
*  100%.
*  All my friends, right?
*  My friends, not all my friends, but during COVID, they're like, what am I going to do?
*  This is really stressful, and I don't have any.
*  Then they got their government money for being out of work.
*  You know what they did, Joe?
*  They bought guitars and baseball cards.
*  I was like, I don't think you were as struggling as you thought you were.
*  Well, they needed something to make them feel good.
*  It's never enough.
*  So it's like you've got to, if you give them, they'll say, well, this isn't basic, this
*  basic income, it's not enough for me to really live, because what is really living?
*  So it's just always going to be more.
*  So it's like it's flustering to try to solve that.
*  The hard work's the answer.
*  Well, you're not going to feel happy with no purpose, and that is another thing that
*  we found during COVID.
*  One of the things, people were so at each other's throats during COVID, it's because
*  at home they were all fucking bored and they were all just freaking out and just like attacking
*  people over, wear a fucking mask!
*  Everybody was out of their minds.
*  I lost my mind.
*  It's like most people did, especially if you're seeing your life go away, because maybe you've
*  worked 30 years to develop a business, then all of a sudden some new thing comes along
*  and you have to shut your business down for a year and a half.
*  That's not going to work.
*  I don't have money, and you can't get a loan, and like, oh my God, and the lease payments
*  for the building, they keep coming in.
*  What am I going to do?
*  And then you're onto it all day.
*  Crushed all small businesses that they claim they care about.
*  God, they crushed so many fucking restaurants.
*  They almost crushed the comedy store.
*  Oh, I haven't made money in six months, and now a different group's going to break the
*  windows out of that place that I didn't even.
*  So all at the same time?
*  That's enough to make people...
*  And people are saying defund the police at the same time.
*  You're like, oh, this is great.
*  That's enough to change my political opinions, and it's enough for a psychopath to grab a
*  gun and go, hey, maybe don't knock out the windows of my store.
*  It was just too much at once.
*  If someone comes along from the left that is an objective, sensible person that's making
*  sense of immigration, foreign policy, then I'm still left.
*  I'm still the same person.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  I'm still the same.
*  Because socially, I'm left on almost everything.
*  On almost everything.
*  The hard right is, to me, just like the hard left.
*  The crazy fucks that are out there on the fringes, and they sort of define the left
*  and define the right for everybody.
*  You define the right by white supremacists, KKK.
*  You define the left by Antifa.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Most people are like right here.
*  Most people are like, I just want rules and law and everybody be kind and healthy and
*  a prosperous society and no pollution.
*  I feel like we could all work together and do a better job of all these different things.
*  Like Jordan Peterson says, who's my favorite human in the world, I love him so much, but
*  he was saying it's really easy to identify and rebuke the far right.
*  We're very good at identifying it and going, I devout or disavow, whatever the term is,
*  we don't want that.
*  But then with the left, the very extreme left, we kind of celebrate it and we post it and
*  we brag about it and we go, look how good I am.
*  I think they thought finally we have thugs.
*  I think it's one of those things.
*  I'm against the far left.
*  The bullies, I am too.
*  It's the bullies.
*  It's the bullies on both sides.
*  The people that just want to use a group and have a bunch of people, they're all together
*  and attack and just go smash windows and light things on fire.
*  Then there's also, they get funded to do that too.
*  All this shit that you're seeing where the Harris, where they funded all these different
*  organizations, people fund through political, through PACs, through all sorts of different
*  methods, fund all sorts of organizations.
*  They donate to all sorts of organizations.
*  Some of these organizations cause problems and they do it because they want them to do
*  it.
*  They want problems.
*  During the Black Lives Matter, when you see stacks of bricks laying around, I'm not buying
*  it.
*  I'm not buying this.
*  Someone left $30,000 worth of bricks around.
*  They were just doing construction.
*  Just conveniently happened at the same time the protest is here.
*  Everyone loves coincidences.
*  What a coincidence.
*  They think it's all a coincidence.
*  What are you, a conspiracy theorist?
*  That is another group thing about being a part of the group.
*  If you're a part of a group that's yelling and lighting things on fire, you know how
*  much fun that must be?
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's happening.
*  Especially, you're doing it to support black people.
*  Who doesn't want to support black people?
*  I'm the best.
*  Light up Starbucks.
*  Starbucks is like, what did I do?
*  I didn't do anything.
*  At least when I supported my group, I didn't get a free Xbox.
*  I don't think you really care about what you believe in if you're getting lamps and shit.
*  And then in New York, they have the dumbest way of handling it.
*  They just let people burn themselves out.
*  It's crazy.
*  De Blasio was the worst.
*  You know how funny his real name is?
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  What's De Blasio's real name?
*  It's some crazy villain name.
*  His real name is Mookie Betts.
*  No, it's like a villain.
*  He sounds like a villain.
*  What's his real name?
*  It changed his name, dude.
*  Warren Wilhelm Jr.
*  Warren Wilhelm Jr.
*  Warren Bill De Blasio.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, that's a fucking, that's an evil name.
*  That is for sure.
*  Warren De Blasio Wilhelm.
*  Yeah.
*  Warren Wilhelm Jr.
*  I like to call myself Jeff Dice.
*  It changed his name.
*  Jeff Dice Sr.
*  And people are like, oh, is your son?
*  I don't know.
*  No.
*  No, no, but if I, you know, just Jeff Dice Sr.
*  If I ever get it, it's going to be Jeff Jr.
*  If I have one.
*  That's going to be Jeff Jr.
*  I'm going to be Jeff Jr.
*  I'm going to be Jeff Jr.
*  I'm going to be Jeff Jr.
*  I'm just preparing for the family.
*  You're Joe Rogan Sr.
*  It's perfect.
*  This is fucking so funny, though, that the guy changed his name to make it ethnic.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  De Blasio.
*  Hey, De Blasio, the main New Yorker.
*  Right, I'm the guy, Gabba the Gooyah.
*  De Blasio knows how to take care of you.
*  Eat the fries, get a vaccine.
*  Come on.
*  William?
*  What happened?
*  No, no, Bill.
*  De Blasio.
*  Aren't you Old Man Wilhelm's kid?
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*  that's not me.
*  I'm the guy who pays taxpayers money to interpretive dance performers with masks on in the middle
*  of the street.
*  Did you ever see that?
*  You're like Alec Baldwin's wife.
*  Do you remember her?
*  Did you ever see De Blasio?
*  Oh, that lady's great.
*  She's from like Connecticut, and she's like how do you say orange orange? I'm from Spain
*  Just made up a whole a like that's crazy
*  Mentally crazy she must be sexually yeah amazing I bet she's fine
*  To pretty high gal to pretend. She's a different name. That's why I lady that lady's fun 100%
*  What was I just asking oh the the video where de Blasio had the performative dancers? Oh? Yeah listen to this
*  Take it from the beginning so you can hear how fucking stupid this is
*  Look at this they all have masks on outside
*  We need a recovery that brings back the life and the heart and the energy of this city
*  Oh my god gets to be a part of this dance
*  We're gonna really bring back the heart and soul in New York City
*  We need our arts and culture back and we need people to see it and feel it to participate in it
*  To know that essence of New York City has not been defeated by the coronavirus
*  Pequod back strong in 2021 month after month in 2021 as you see the city come back to life culture
*  We'll leave the way culture is another step towards a recovery for our city
*  We're launching with 115 street locations in all five borders
*  And you bring stages to our neighborhoods and culture to the heart of our neighbors
*  I wonder how many of those 115 people in 115 neighborhoods shot at those
*  Although when I think of New York City
*  I do think of people spazzing out in masks like that
*  But I do think of them going like this like on drugs asking me for money
*  That's what I think of when I think of New York. This is peak woke
*  This is absolute peak woke insanity stupid shitty out of rhythm dancing
*  Terrible music while everybody's wearing masks outside and they spent money on this and this was his way of bringing the city back through
*  Culture, it's just so unlikeable. It's peak woke. This is this I think this moment this video
*  This is the historians will look back at this like this is oh, yeah
*  This is when they clearly lost their fucking money
*  Yeah, the biggest metropolitan city on earth the one right if you can make it there you can make it anywhere that retard
*  Mayor and this is what he's doing with the taxpayer money while he's got the whole city shut down
*  Yeah, anyone to defund the police they won't believe that people riot and smash windows and steal things
*  We need to bring our culture back. Yeah, you need to leave the job. You're terrible
*  This job people are gonna. Oh you believe that that wasn't real
*  You're gonna look at it right? Yeah. Yeah, they're gonna go come on peak woke insanity
*  If that's that's different at any other time in history
*  Yeah
*  If that was in
*  1990 and the mayor of New York had people dancing with masks on in the street everybody like what the fuck
*  Yeah, someone bully them immediately. Yeah, like what is happening?
*  But they that was when everybody was so confused and so mentally ill I think as a society we mentally had a cold
*  We're all
*  No one felt healthy. Yeah, the whole country was mentally ill. Yeah legitimately. Yeah
*  That's that's it. Oh, yeah, that's peak. Well, you know what those say Joe they go. That was 2020, dude
*  Cuz they'll dismiss it as crazy. Oh, that was that's different. That's 2020
*  He's gonna bring up 2020 again. That's 40 months ago, right?
*  Exactly. Where's the apologies? What's the big deal? Where's the hey we were?
*  Hey, you know, maybe we were wrong about that. When are you ever gonna hear that?
*  Not only do they not admit that they were wrong, but now they're the victims
*  Yeah, you know everybody else is spreading misinformation and we have to censor online speeches
*  How what about you guys? Yeah, you got us into the Iraq war with right information you cunts
*  I've been wrong all the time and I just go yeah, oh, I'm sorry
*  I didn't I've been wrong on this fucking podcast right now. But like the left will just go no, that's different
*  Like I'm like just can you just at least say we're sorry for calling you a
*  Super spreading jerk because you wanted to leave your house to get coffee. Can I get one?
*  Yeah, they were wrong about everything and they gas lit the whole fucking world
*  And they got away with it and they got away with it and they almost got away with demonizing
*  Their political opponent and putting him in jail. They almost got him in jail. Oh my god real close. Yeah, that's
*  Convicted him 34 felonies for things that aren't even felonies way
*  And also people can't even tell you what those felonies are they just it's more fun
*  It's more to fund to call someone a felon. Yeah, but that's why you got convicted in the first place
*  Yeah, it's all political. It's like a name-calling
*  The whole world just lost its mind in four years and four years everybody just it was like there was so many
*  Contributing factors of the hatred of Trump and then there was the coronavirus the chaos and then the racism the sexism
*  The George Floyd thing and then Biden seems to be dead and he's still running the country like what's happening
*  And then you know and then now finally when Trump won it was like the first time in a long time I was like
*  Yeah, maybe we're gonna be okay. Well see the stuff that he's saying
*  I love the college area and domestic about it. Yeah, this is like what most logical sensible people have been saying
*  well, I also like like the the double standard is just really fascinating to me is like like
*  What's the BOSA guy from the 49ers? He comes in like while they're interviewing the guys that were the stars of the game
*  He runs up and puts his MAGA hat on and then he like leaves and everyone's like well
*  He's gonna have to be fined for that like you can't make political statements
*  I'm like, I don't know if you remember that BLM that was like on the field like all their helmets
*  Political yeah, it's a cultural statement more than it's a politician you're supporting
*  There's a big difference between you don't find that political to stop don't shoot. Is it political?
*  It's not political in a sense where someone's running for office
*  So there's difference between like you're promoting someone running for office while it's on television
*  And they don't want you doing that on television. The other thing is like you're taking a cultural stand
*  It's a different thing. It's got political aspects to it. It's a little nature. It's supported primarily by the left, right?
*  Okay, but it's not the same. It's not vote for so-and-so, right? Okay, right
*  But if you were if he had a vote for Harris hat on a bit right give a fuck
*  I don't know if yeah, but that is the interesting like I remember seeing that going
*  we're gonna have to find all those other players who wore defund the police on their things and
*  You know little different it's different. It's a social issue, but I think the point is the same
*  It's like these guys are you it's also it's like how many of these fucking dudes who do this stuff?
*  Just do it because they know they're gonna get social media cred. Oh, yeah, that's tough to figure out, too
*  Yeah, there's a lot of that in the world today like when people know that you can say certain things get a it's hard to know
*  What you really think right? I've gotten accused of pandering right there like oh he's pandering to the right or whatever
*  Yeah, no finesse Mitchell goes you got a real political lately to me and I was like we're just saying what I think
*  Also, like I told you this like two is like when I was in Seattle
*  You know and I was like making jokes like nobody goes wow you're really leaning into this left stuff
*  You know like when comics are going up and talking about all the things they talk about I don't go trying to make that
*  Obama money huh like I like no they just are saying what they think yeah
*  Nobody ever accused of people of pandering until you do it like on the conservative side well
*  Then they think you're pandering people do like them they catch people pandering though if you can catch them
*  But how do you know well?
*  They like to accuse people pandering if they disagree with what that person says
*  Yeah, bingo and our community like as far as stand-up convenience has been very left-leaning
*  Always I've never once gone all your pandering to fit in here or you're pandering to get on the tonight show
*  Are you standard you get on Jimmy Kimmel definitely do though for sure?
*  But I never accused him of that because how am I supposed to know if they really feel like that way or not right?
*  But then I say something I really don't care as long as it's funny
*  Right if you're pandering, but it's really hilarious, but the problem with me what I really get grossed out by is claptor
*  Yeah, I'm guilty of it sometimes lately for sure just in certain scenarios. I've done it. Yeah
*  People just the only one say things that people gonna clap and agree to
*  Line like hey you missed a whole part of this whole formula. We're all participating in here. This is a comedy club
*  We're coming here for funsies hundred percent. Yeah, yeah, and I think also too. It's like well. That's why it's hard
*  That's why it's really rough to accuse someone of it
*  Yeah, because you don't know like what is the difference between pandering and just playing to a crowd mm-hmm
*  But you go hey Joe you got to read the crowd right well
*  What's the difference between pandering and reading the crowd?
*  Yeah, I guess reading a crowd is pandering so then I guess yes in a way
*  I'm a guilty of it, but we all are yeah, I guess I've never been one for reading a crowd
*  I was like you just do your thing. Let's find out like that
*  Let's find out how much this stuff works in Madison, Wisconsin. They go did or knows in
*  Milwaukee Wisconsin somewhere in Wisconsin the people after the show I bet you don't do that material in LA. I go damn sure I do
*  Yeah, yeah, I do this material in LA for sure
*  Yeah, people have this bizarre idea that you change your act depending upon who's in the crowd right?
*  Yeah, you know how hard it is to come up with all this stuff
*  Yeah, I feel like fucking six months to come up with 20 minutes hard of that one new jokes needs to be blossomed into a thing
*  It needs to be water, but I will say like I'll change you know read a crowd like if it's a corporate event
*  I'm gonna do different material. I'll do different words of the same bits and things if I have to like I have to adjust you
*  Know yeah, oh, that's a different gig though, right?
*  The corporate gig is just I'm only like hiking up my skirt stick my ass up
*  Dude, that's all it is. That's the real luxury of being a successful like as successful as you know
*  A lot of you comedians are you don't have to do that. You don't have to do the corporate gig
*  I don't have to but I still get offered it and I say yes, and I'm going oh
*  Stuff yeah, Ron White did one he goes
*  I did it because they offer me a fuckload of money and it was the worst experience
*  I ever had a fucking life
*  Yeah stressful it also is kind of exciting though
*  I kind of crave those moments where I'm like nervous again like that like in February when I came into the mothership for the first
*  Time I was like oh, this is exciting behind the curtain a little nervous a little nervous to go out there
*  You're up in the balcony. Why I'm going on
*  I'm a little like I like this like the first time I did the tonight show I had all these like
*  Butterflies like that was I like I live for those kind of moments so like
*  You know sometimes I'll take a corporate I'm going to do it live pretty nervous. I'd love to yeah
*  That's I'd love to that I did that because it made me nervous. I said no to it at first really yeah
*  I was like it's done one shot. Yeah, but then I thought why you being a pussy then I called my manager back
*  I said don't say no yet. Let me call you tomorrow. I called it love the next day. I'm like alright. We're good
*  I love it. I think that's the future well
*  It's definitely you prepare for it more and you think about it in a different way than a regular show
*  Like I prepared so much more than I ever do normally we didn't have to sit around
*  Approving edits from people at a big corporation with a bunch of laptops who aren't creative who go maybe this bit
*  And you go I'm the comedian. Why are you editing that and so like I had live once the future
*  I had to do that once with a Comedy Central
*  I had a Comedy Central deal to do a special and I bailed on it. Oh really yeah, just after the phone call
*  Yeah, can't do this. Yeah, so it's like you can't say that I'm like why not
*  Yeah, we're talking about do you guys want funny or not funny like these so I thought they cable
*  They've changed their standards though, and then like by 2014. I got away with a lot
*  I got away with a lot when I did a Comedy Central special in 2014, but they now I don't even know
*  What they make anymore other than South Park?
*  Central I mean do they even have South Park anymore?
*  I'm not sure if they're making new episodes
*  But they have that they play a lot of reruns of things and then they also have all those daily shows and all that stuff
*  Okay daily show yeah, but like they used to have so many shows
*  I know I just don't think TV can compete with internet anymore. No, and they had an app too
*  I know Comedy Central had an app for a while. I don't know if they still have that running
*  They still have a Comedy Central app you won't hear a good story about
*  That makes sense, and that's where the new South Park episodes are right. What's that comedians name that?
*  Joe list just made a documentary about
*  Gosh he's a great guy from Boston. He now lives in the Keys of Florida. He's a Boston comic kind of a legend
*  Tom Dustin yeah
*  there's a great Tom Dustin story in Boston where the women that ran Comedy Central were like in the crowd and
*  It's like a showcase thing and the owners like just keep it clean
*  This is the other thing and Tom Dustin is already kind of a controversial guy as far as like the Booker was like
*  You know you know our reputation here
*  And we're letting you do this because we want to help you but like play ball
*  so Tom Dustin goes out there and he's struggling a bit and then he
*  And it just in the middle of said he just decides
*  I don't want to do this you know like I don't want to jump through these hoops
*  So he goes I heard Comedy Central's here and everyone claps and he goes how many fat
*  Bearded unfunny fucks are you gonna put on the network this year?
*  Everyone's like mortified, and then he's like like he like
*  They're lighting him get off the stage get off the stage, and then he he grabs
*  He's I that's it and then he comes back and he was oh, I forgot you're all a bunch of n-word cunts
*  The audience and like that like because he just wanted to stick it to the comedy club and the and the people at that yes
*  That's the guy I'm Dustin yeah
*  Great fucking funny guy
*  Must have missed him
*  He's a you know he's grinding he's grinding it out one of those Boston boys
*  And where does he live now now he lives in that he started a comedy club in Key West. What's it called?
*  I know there's a comedy club in Key West that a lot of people go down to it's supposed to be a fun game
*  Doug does it all just Stan Hope does it I know for some I don't know Swartz has done it, but
*  I know Swartz was down there when I was down, so he just works his own club
*  Yeah, just made his own started his own club. It's happy
*  Pretty cool
*  You guys did it in different ways Joe
*  There you go Sam talent
*  Hell yeah, it's great be fun to do a gig down there just for funsies. Yeah that help him out a lot, too
*  It's a fun area those people are wild people
*  I mean that's been a wild place for a long ass time very uncharted territory
*  Yeah, like you know nomads like fucking it's pretty cool. I like it there
*  Yeah, and you can't just fly into the keys
*  I mean I am if you can I didn't know that you could because I had to drive
*  Dave Williamson drove me for like three hours like we like how long have we been in the keys?
*  He's like the gigs up here. Don't worry. Go by cruise ship. That's well
*  How they get there actually
*  Have you done cruises been on?
*  No, yeah, not me dude not into it. Yeah, no well
*  You know it's funny about the cruise ships while we're talking about like corporate corruption. It's international waters
*  So like the casino you kill you well the casino you're like this kind of is
*  This kind of feels unfair and they're like well who you gonna complain to no one. There's no pit boss
*  Yes, goes. Don't worry. This is all sanctioned by the get you drunk and steal your money. Oh, and they're the games are rigged
*  It's just still you know I would like to talk to the casino commission they go shut up
*  You're in the middle of the ocean
*  You know you talk to the guy that works there you're like hey, buddy
*  How much you you know make no I make it like a dollar a week or what you know like it's some crazy thing
*  There's allowed to do that they give them free food and a ball
*  Yeah, and the guy's more than where I look you know how about those folks that like live on cruise ships?
*  Do you know the certain folks they gave up their house and they just live on a cruise ship all year round
*  I will say and I promise I'm not trying to be contrarian here because I love Tim Dillon
*  I love like all these guys who will shit on cruise ships
*  And they're right every bit of criticism that my favorite people in my life
*  Criticize about cruise ships the other side of that coin is some people just want to eat shit and look at things
*  They want to be there are some people it's nice for my dad
*  You know like easy he's happy to just go okay. What are they playing a rush hour to or like it's okay?
*  Yeah, those people are enjoying it sure it's a vacation
*  Yeah, you wear with a whole bunch of people sunburned all sitting around you got water slides
*  Yeah, and fucking all kinds of shit to do and yeah, yeah, it's fine for them. I get it. Yeah, it's not my brain right
*  I don't want to do it. I don't think up that one nightmare for me
*  But then every three days you get to waddle your fat ass off the boat and see you know
*  Puerto Rico for three hours, and then you get back on the boat some people that's that's a pretty cool deal
*  Some people some people yeah, yeah, I don't want to perform on those things well how many times you've done it
*  Oh, I've only been on a cruise ship like probably three times
*  And I got like some special deal where you doing stand-up or you I got to do stand-up Joe
*  What a thing?
*  One of the other comics Tom Cotter goes you don't be here. I know Tom. Tom's awesome
*  He was the other comic on the boat. He saw that I was doing it. He goes dude
*  You don't want to be on here. He's a go
*  You got the rest of your life to be on a cruise ship like if this is where you want to end up and
*  And he was speaking to the comedy aspect of it like it was just pretty that's a dark state depressing
*  Yeah, cuz Tom's my age Tom's awesome. I've known Tom since we were open micers really yeah the first time
*  I ever went to an open mic night. I saw Tom on stage
*  I just found out that Greg Fitzsimmons was a Boston guy. He started a week after me really yeah
*  We both started together. Do you consider yourself a Boston guy? Yeah?
*  Nice yeah
*  I think you develop a kind of sense of comedy and of urgency and like the audience's attention span and like
*  The comics from Boston have you know at least back in that day. They had a sharp material
*  Oh, yeah, you there were too many good comics. It was it was also like a real
*  It was a real pressure cooker because you had these guys that were these national level
*  Comics that could have been some of the best comics in the country, but they never left Boston right and so you're always working
*  With these guys these Steve Sweeney Don Gavin Kevin Knox Lenny Clark. They were monsters
*  Yeah, Lenny would have been pissed if he didn't say him right there. Oh, he's a monster
*  He was the first guy or the second guy actually I ever get paid to open for really
*  Yeah, yeah, those guys are rock stars, and then they stayed put and so you guys have to compete with the rock stars exactly
*  So Lenny got out and he did a lot of TV shows and a bunch of stuff
*  But a lot of those guys they stayed put and they they were still fuck like Steve Sweeney
*  He's to this day one of the the greatest killers on stage. I've ever seen in my life. They got destroyed
*  But really I mean destroyed and Boston did a dirty thing
*  They did a dirty thing the dirty thing was like say if you're a famous comedian
*  And you're coming to play Nick's comedy stop for the weekend like Billy Crystal
*  They would put on Don Gavin. Oh just Barry have it
*  Steve Sweeney
*  Was how Mike Donovan I like that and they would just eat shit
*  Got her and they would love that these guys would eat shit
*  I like that they bring in a head they pay him all this money to go perform at this club
*  This is a club by the way that would pay you in coke or cash. Oh, yeah, that's old days
*  Yeah, right there. I've only read about that which makes me so happy like you want coke money or just coke or just money back in
*  The day there was a club that used to do that. I like that and I think probably more than one
*  Oh for sure. I mean these were partying people. I would hear about that all the time
*  You know how they all got hit up though. What do you mean? Oh, yeah, you're getting paid cash. Well, uh
*  They all didn't pay their I remember opening for Greg Geraldo as like the club that I started at like we were
*  He just used to the open micers as free openers and like and also like pick up the comedian at the airport and we wanted
*  Greg
*  Porter all these we were excited to pick up the comics from the airport
*  But that was his way of not having to pay a car service to pick up the comics from the airport
*  I love the club owner did that club owner do it and then but they need to also be like you guys are all gonna do
*  Short sets in front of the headliner, which we're excited to do but that also means he doesn't have to pay us to open
*  So he doesn't have to pay for a middle host
*  So it's a little trick but we were happy to be part of the trick because we just wanted stage time
*  Or you get to hang out with Greg Geraldo how cool is that being an intern? Yeah, it felt like that
*  And I was happy with the trade, you know that stage time is valuable
*  But in it got to meet all like my heroes, you know that came through and I remember Greg Geraldo, you know
*  He's torn. He's he's clean now. He's trying to be an honorable
*  Husband and he's you know, he's got the face and he would just be like, you know, Jeff if this was back in the day
*  We would been knee-deep in coke and I'm like, let's do that now
*  Why do I miss it, you know, like I'm reading about all these tales. It's unsustainable
*  The only guy's been able to sustain partying for an entire career staying hope
*  Yeah, well or they die. Well Dangerfield was doing it till the end. He did. Yeah, he was smoking pot doing lines to the very
*  Yeah, he was committed. Oh, come on. Yeah
*  The notes in love you saw me browsing those last night. I was pretty into that. Yeah, how'd you get him?
*  His wife his wife gave him to us. Really? Yeah
*  Whitney knows his wife and when she found out we were opening up the club. I
*  Love that I love stuff like that
*  I want to do something like what he did where he had Rodney Dangerfield and friends where he did those HBO shows
*  Oh, yeah, we introduced you guys to like some of the best comics
*  I want to do something like that. You'd help a lot of guys
*  Let me tell you because doing that like from the mothership would be fucking amazing that helped a lot of guys
*  I think there's guys out there that that could use it to there's guys out there that have like 10 minutes of murder
*  Put those 10 minutes of murder together and you know
*  I have four or five guys on a show if you have some fun
*  Would you be able to commit to picking the guys you like as opposed to the guys that Netflix wants you to plug?
*  No, if I was gonna do Joe Rogan and friends, it would have to be people that I really think I love that
*  whether I know them or not, I love that I really admire and that's what
*  What he did what Rodney did was different than anybody else other than Carson who wasn't really a comedian, right?
*  So Johnny Carson was the way that everybody got famous you got on the night show Carson
*  You get to sit. Thank you. I believe you just sit next to Carson like holy shit
*  I'm sitting next to Carson and like he likes you so much
*  you made it your headline and comedy clubs after that and
*  Traveling around the country and you know, this guy's like Rich Jenny did like dozens of yeah, Rich Jenny was great
*  Amazing a very unhappy man, but like a talented man super depressed
*  Yeah, but then you had Rodney and what Rondi did is he introduced people to the HBO special comedians?
*  So these weren't comedians like tonight show clean comedians
*  These were guys like Robert Schiml dice clay Bill Hicks Sam Kennison Dom Irera
*  Killer Lenny Clark killers killers. Yeah, and like headliners already like and then they all got HBO specials
*  So then they they all became like national talent and like people that would see them everywhere
*  But it all came out of Rodney because Rodney had this desire to introduce these comics to the rest of the world
*  Love that nobody else was doing and I love that that's like that's how you help people
*  Yes by going hey, I know this guy isn't famous. He doesn't have a sitcom. Yeah, but I right I'm I'm funny
*  Here's the guy that I think is funny. I was think I think our Rodney Dangerfield is David tell joke joke joke
*  Just crushing killer. I think our Larry the cable guys Theo von like, you know
*  Like it's got the voice in the things and the you don't know what is a story and what is a joke, right? You know our
*  Eddie Murphy's Kevin Hart you can cut you know our normie is our Norm MacDonald is kind of a mark
*  Norman like with you have these kind of next guys sort of I think they're all their own thing. They are their own thing
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't really think it's our this or I don't think about it that way
*  Well, you don't think styles influence people. Yeah, they definitely do for sure
*  Sure, I think you know, like if you listen to Stephen right then you listen to Mitch Hedberg. Yeah, and that's great
*  Yeah, that's that's that beautiful absurdist non-seculars. Yeah
*  I'm very inspired by Norman Patrice and Simpson's like if you watch my act you can go I can I know all the things this
*  Guy watched for I think it tells his own thing like it tells I think he's one of the greatest of all time
*  I really do. I think so too. I saw him at the mothership one night. I came in just to watch the set. It was
*  Amazing machine gun Joe and he's so
*  In the groove. He's just this Zen master stage for every
*  Every beat is perfect. He's a master. I love him. He's so good
*  He's so good at just talking shit to when he has everybody come on stage with him
*  He gives everybody a microphone that just starts shitting on. Yeah, he's the best
*  you know, he also like has still like
*  He's still maintained people like when you don't change, you know, like if you're a fat celebrity, you better stay fat
*  We don't want to see you skinny, you know, and if and if you're a skinny person you get fat
*  They go what happened, you know, like we don't like anything. That's why kid child stars are doomed
*  Cuz they're gonna have to change and you're gonna I liked him when he was a cute kid, you know
*  But I think the same thing is true with like a tell he still looks like he's broke
*  Yeah, you look at a tell you like that guy is it?
*  Same dress is the same right every time you see him even on his specials wearing a it could be 80 degrees outside
*  He's got a jacket like a do-rag and a hat
*  Love that and I love that like you like you're like, is he okay? You're like, that's one of the best comedians in the world
*  Yeah, but he's really in his own little world
*  Like he really does still read newspapers and he writes jokes in a coffee shop and his flip phone
*  Yeah texts you do to know from a flip phone
*  Every time I get a text from him
*  I appreciate it because I know how long it took to make these fucking things take forever and he was in here in the studio
*  He was sitting there. He had a text. Oh, he's going to do
*  Yeah, you like my dad that's why but he's right right if you don't want to be connected to that world
*  You don't be influenced in just stay in the zone and who's better at staying in the zone than him nobody
*  Yeah, who's better at coming up with new material nobody. Yeah, he's awesome
*  He so he's just like found this area to exist in. Yes, the best good. Yeah, I'm good
*  I love it. I think he's one of the greats. So I we agree that he's one of the greats
*  I had a couple of friends. This is a long time. We like we just went to a theater show
*  We saw this comic he wasn't very funny. They love to do that. I saw the special it sucked
*  You know
*  Better than just going enjoyed it and so I go who'd you see and they go I can't remember his name
*  But we'll text you if we can remember or whatever and I said, okay
*  These are my good friends of mine and so then like later on they're like, oh it was David Tell and I go
*  Oh, you're wrong
*  You are just wrong and they're like no it was really bad. I got wrong. You're wrong
*  There's just no way that that is and I think that that's like the disconnect of like maybe a theater show
*  Also or like a special, you know talking to your friends were you looking at your phone?
*  They wanted some crowd work or something. I don't know what they expected but I was like you're wrong
*  Like that's one of the greatest. Yeah, I think sometimes if a venue is too big, you know
*  And the person's all smile like maybe that's it. There's a disconnect there. Maybe but I don't know but there's usually screens
*  Yeah, it's people have shitty tastes. Yeah, I couldn't believe it
*  Yeah, I've heard things like that before about other comedians that I think are awesome
*  When also the stadiums laughing and going this guy's the best and then my
*  Cheap jokes, right? You mean my favorite kind
*  Cheap joke that makes me laugh it work
*  I'm not yeah
*  Necessarily connoisseur. I'm just here to have a good time
*  Well, that's I do think that's a good thing too about taste like I think it was in Dave Grohl's book
*  He was like I'll eat like I'll drink shitty coffee from like a gas station
*  But also appreciate like a nice espresso and I think that's a good way to like think about even like jokes
*  Yeah, I'll take a one-liner a cheap joke. I'll take a story a misdirection. I'll take anything. Just let me make me laugh
*  Yeah, I like the good stuff and the bad stuff
*  Yeah
*  But the thing that's hard for comics is to maintain an audience enthusiasm
*  Right like to watch comedy like and appreciate it like you used to before you were a comic
*  Mmm, because you know the tricks and this it's one way to you like when you see someone's doing hacky stuff like yuck
*  But just fun just have a good time. Yeah, don't start breaking down someone's bids or correct. I see comics
*  They can't laugh. I know watching things and everything is like
*  Yeah, a little extra time to get to this joke could have edited that out a little bit. You start like
*  You know too much, right?
*  Did that early I'd police guys right like when I was like a
*  Passionate obsessed with comedy open mic er
*  I would be like, you know so and so has a bit about that subject and it's like yeah
*  I'm like we're all talking about the same subjects, you know
*  But I would be the guy that would be like well, you shouldn't do that cuz Daniel Tosh has a thing, you know
*  Like but it was all bullshit. It was just me being so passionate about it that I was over
*  Well, you're probably applying those standards to yourself too. Yeah. Oh for sure. Yeah, so that's part of it
*  Someone who's like come on man, you know that fucking Gilbert Gottfried had a bit about that
*  Yeah, but like also just you don't want to overthink it
*  I think you're 100% right like have fun with the crowd be out there
*  Yeah
*  and just be able to enjoy different kinds of comedy too and just some people just can't and there's so many people particularly left-wing comics like
*  Comedy has to line up with their ideology or they just won't they won't get into it. They can't I hate it
*  I used to see that with Dice Clay
*  that was the big one and we were talking about this last night because like
*  I came in as like a Dice Clay fan when I was a kid
*  Mm-hmm
*  and by the time dice had gotten kicked off of MTV and it was like
*  In fashion for comedians to call him a sexist and a pig and like this guy is it's a character
*  Yeah, what do you talk about? Also, it's like shut the fuck up. Right and then
*  They were there was like so much jealousy
*  There's a little jealousy about him too because he was the first comic that ever sold out arenas
*  So he was selling out arenas when everybody else was like struggling to like fill a weekend at a little comedy club like what?
*  Yeah, these guys all started with him and he was one of those guys that got on running danger real special and just took off
*  Interesting they did his own special
*  I think it was just I think was called dice rules and that special took off and then dude
*  He was everywhere and it wasn't it was different than any other kind of comedy because everybody knew the nursery rhymes and they wanted
*  So it was like going to a concert, yeah, you know what's in the bowl
*  We're different if anyone was to criticize, you know
*  Like I know a lot of the old dogs in Boston won't be like these guys aren't doing anything different, but right that's different
*  Yeah, so you get something that's different that's working and then people will kind of get mad
*  They were like you claimed you wanted something different and it's working. It's working and it's different
*  Because you do a different thing like if you're an observational comic
*  Yes
*  You do a different thing doesn't mean that that thing that all on a percent tens of thousands of people are screaming and cheering for is
*  Wrong, right?
*  That's a crazy way I'll give you a great example. I
*  Was at skank fest right this year in Vegas, which what a tree and so grateful to them for having me
*  So I don't ever want to make it sound like I'm not grateful, but I went and watched
*  Carrot Top Scott Thompson, right? I went over to I went over to the Luxor
*  I've watched the show and then I come back to skank fest and I was like, oh we were at carrot top
*  You know, but if you were like carrot top, I was like, he's better than all of us just so, you know
*  He's funny. It's great Joe
*  90 minutes of not missing it was relevant as far as like he was doing topical things
*  He had a P diddy joke that happened like the night before I saw him like he had all the you know
*  It wasn't all props. There was a lot of topicals of tons of Trump stuff political stuff
*  there was like three like I'll maybe a one-minute segment where I was like
*  You know cuz I was going in with an open mind
*  Like if it's gonna be shit, I'll say it's shit and if it's great
*  I'll say it's great, you know
*  And there was like there was like a one little chunk that I was like that's a little hacky and it's like
*  you know a Vegas Luxor joke about like oh they made it a
*  Pyramid because if you try to jump out the window, you'll just end back up at the casinos
*  That's kind of a I've heard that kind of thing. But then I started thinking about it. I was like no
*  He probably wrote that he's been doing this for 29 years sometimes you'll watch prior
*  It'll be like black woman like this white and you go that's hacky
*  No, he did it first, right?
*  And so in my mind I was like 90 minutes of not missing and he's the nicest guy in the world
*  Yeah, and he's crushing it. It's a great great great show
*  Well, he was a guy that in the early days when he was taking off every jealous shit on yeah
*  Everyone shit on including Hicks Hicks had a whole bit about Carrot Top which sucks cuz he's so good
*  It was just a jealousy thing
*  It was a shitting on the guy who was doing this thing that you think is somehow another coloring outside the lines
*  Which is crazy to make any sense and then he also kind of was alienated from everybody because he did then he did a residency
*  In Vegas, he was like one of the first big guys to just do it. He's been in Vegas forever 29 years
*  That's so crazy. Yeah, that's a long time and that means it must be pretty good
*  Like it was it does well. Oh, man. I want you to see have you seen it really nice guy. I want you
*  It's so good and I couldn't he was couldn't have been more humble and like it was just like such a nice guy and I
*  Said this to him. I wanted him to hear it that like, you know
*  All the hate that my like comedy friends do is just because it's become a thing. Yeah, it's not cuz it's real
*  So like I think this happens in life like people go Henry Winkler Jeff
*  You worked with Henry Winkler isn't he the nicest guy in the world?
*  Yes, Henry Winkler is the nicest guy in the world, but so are a lot of people right?
*  But we've learned Henry Winkler is the nice ham so we just repeat it, you know
*  Oh Taylor Swift only sings about her ex-boyfriends every musician sings about their exes. Why is that Taylor Swift's thing?
*  Well, she's got a lot, but it's just something we've heard and we repeat as like a hacky thing
*  And I think that's same like carrot top it became
*  Hack it became like a trend to make fun of him. But yeah, he didn't deserve it that act is killer
*  Yeah, there's a lot of that. That's Trump as a Nazi, right? Yeah, it's not fair. Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of that
*  There's narratives. There's headlines clickbait narratives that just get spread. I don't know. I hate it's easy to define people in a certain way
*  They'll say oh, I see it in like small thing. Oh, you know, you swallow 10 spiders spiders a year, and they don't
*  What are you sleeping outside with your mouth open? What are you talking about?
*  Why are people repeating these things that aren't oh, you know, you lose a million hairs a month
*  You like no you don't like where are these things being repeated or perpetuated?
*  Just like we were talking about how much Lizzo made
*  Exactly, yeah, which I'm probably aware that a little bit but I think we got to the bottom of it
*  Well, we probably are at least semi accurate. I just wonder who came up with that list in the first place
*  well, but that's the difference between me saying something wrong on your podcast and
*  Millions of people repeating a thing that they heard about carrot top, you know I'm saying like I just I don't understand how that becomes a
*  Reputation and now this guy lives in some world where he goes everyone hates me and even family guys shitting on me
*  I don't deserve this
*  Well one of the things he said that after he came on my show he started getting a lot of love
*  Oh good. It was way different a lot of people
*  That's great shows that had like yeah fans of my show and then wanted to come to see him. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's like he turned a corner and he should have never had to do that
*  I never met the guy right I didn't meet him until I did a podcast with him
*  Yeah, so for me it was like it was cool to just like just yeah
*  Just chill have fun. Yeah, let him get out of that right, you know
*  Comedian yeah, and he's a nice guy. Yeah, he's not hurting anybody. Do you do it a sweetheart of a guy, right?
*  I feel like what happened to more prop comics. They are why don't we see so successful?
*  He defined prop comedy. He's like weird Al. Yeah, you don't see parody music anymore weird Al's goes
*  I got 50 albums who's next you don't see anybody smashing watermelons
*  The only one yeah, I guess Bo Burnham does musical parody, but it's not the same sure he does it
*  But he's not the same on YouTube right? Yeah, that was like, but it isn't like he doesn't take a song
*  You know how like weird I would take Michael Jackson's right so you knew the song and then you repeat. Yeah. Yeah, which is great
*  Yeah, um, I loved weirdo. I've been talking about him a long time
*  But like but prop comics over it's it like puppet comics they went away you have Jeff Dunham and that's it
*  What was the guy I know you'll know this Otto and George?
*  I don't use that best so far. Oh my god Ernie. I used to work with a
*  To do these prom shows at Dangerfields
*  so when I first moved to New York City Dangerfields was one of the clubs that I worked at the most because it was like
*  First of all, I couldn't believe it was Rodney Dangerfields Club
*  And they actually filmed one of Dangerfields specials there and like a fan of Dangerfields a huge fan and
*  We do these prom shows the prom shows would start like 7 p.m
*  Or whatever it was and they would go on until 4 o'clock in the fucking morning and it was kids like from the Bronx
*  It's that nylon they'd come in on buses and limos and they'd all be drunk and they would fill up these fucking
*  little clubs with these kids and then just
*  Want you to do the same material the next show so the kids leave
*  Never had the kids leave so they would tell you hey you got to stop doing new material do the same material every time
*  I'm like, I'm not gonna say material. I'm not gonna bomb. Yeah. Yeah, I'm here to do my say
*  You can't tell me what to do
*  You've got me here for five sets if you got five if I look in that same drunk kid is in the front row
*  Yeah, I'm gonna do a new set. Yeah, that's great. You know, I have another ten minutes. Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean it was fucking ridiculous, but the shows would go on forever and ever and I did a bunch of them with Otto
*  Wow, I'm so jealous to hear that I do think that the internet has a lot of Otto and George
*  This is like you can find stuff cuz that had to see him live because you couldn't believe what the fuck he was saying
*  He was so wild. Yeah, he would say the fucking craziest shit and then he would say to the the puppet I George
*  What the fuck you say? I'll say that talk like that. Yeah, which is great. You got it out, but it's your hand
*  That's the right. Oh, here we go. Yeah, it's so funny
*  Dirtiest dozen 1988. I love it. I love it. This is on the internet
*  I stay hard when I'm drunk
*  George please watch it. There are ladies here
*  He's like a star to me
*  She did a good job
*  I
*  Just love the idea like the premise is preposterous
*  But you had to see him live if you saw him live and you were in the room with him
*  It was so fun on that and that that's a bit like I know everyone talks about blowjobs now
*  But like back at the time that's pretty it like it just
*  88 right now. So he was a kind of a wild dude and you know, unfortunately that kind of cost him a lot of substances
*  Wow, yeah
*  Well off the rails a little crazy
*  We had a guy a couple of guys through these knuckleheads who lived in Seattle
*  But we looked up to him because anyone that was you know
*  Any little ones like an older brother or somebody in comedy was a big deal to us and they did a thing called a robo
*  And he had his own myspace page and everything. It was just this terrible robot
*  It was a trash can that they just put a box head on and
*  They had like two button like that was on a race car kind of thing
*  So it could only spin and the eyes would light up and then when you hit like a thing would make his mouth make a little
*  Line of lights and that guy would just be in the back a comedian would be in the back reading his jokes off the notepad
*  Well, well, here it is robo and the jokes were just so
*  Funny his head would fall off sometimes but he'd be like why do women wear makeup and perfume?
*  Cuz they're ugly and they stink and then he would like spin around
*  I
*  Can't understand it
*  But like yeah, you would just be like why do women get their periods
*  Cuz they deserve it and then all you like spin around and people would leave. I mean, it's an open mic
*  At least
*  It's robo like it's not like it might have been an automated thing or something
*  But they thought it was so funny that someone tried to book them off of a video like that
*  That's a little area. I love that kind of stuff though. Well, somebody probably thought that was a real act
*  Yeah, you could take it somewhere. I love it. You probably could have I mean someone could easily do that
*  Yeah, I mean how hard is it to do? It's so funny. Have you seen that comedian on Kill Tony?
*  What is this gentleman's name that has he has some sort of a neurological condition where he can't talk?
*  So he has a Bluetooth speaker, oh, yeah, there's his jokes
*  I thought I haven't seen him on kill Tony but us comedy club in like two weeks
*  Oh, that's a calendar's Aaron Belial's Aaron Belial. Yeah, very nice guy funny, too. Yeah
*  I've seen this guy on AGT or something. Right? That's what it was. It was on America's Got Talent. Yeah, I've seen him. I
*  I almost did a thing after I had to follow him somewhere
*  I can't remember it was and oh but it was for like Louis J
*  Gun was one of these shows where being mean is like, okay
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, it encouraged it
*  It was like Louis J's like you got to tell your most fucked up joke first and then try to get out of the hole
*  And in my mind, I'm like this sounds like a nightmare
*  Yeah, but they tell us to do that
*  Yeah
*  And every comic made the same mistake where we where we came out and went we try to get it, you know
*  We you know comics we try to play we try to get around the rules a little bit
*  I was going he told us we had to say the most fucked up joke first
*  So we all did that kind of buffer so it just didn't work for any of us
*  But that guy was before me and so I thought about just recording into my phone like a thing and
*  Acting like I'm him as like my first thing and I was like this isn't gonna go over. Well, I'm just gonna
*  Yeah, that's no one's gonna be on your side, right? So but I was like I
*  More brace that guy's
*  Incredible balls. Yeah, I can barely walk, you know can't move his arms. Well playing your hand
*  Yeah, he's playing his hand his hand and he's dealt that yeah, and he's making the fucking best of his headlining
*  100% yeah, that's it. That's a great example. Yeah, yeah, he didn't go all this is bullshit. Send me money
*  Do I have to piss so bad? What's up? I have to piss so bad. All right, should we wrap this up? Yeah, let's do it
*  Last cowboy. Yes last cowboy in LA comes out today
*  Out today, right this comes out tomorrow. Where can people see it? Yeah
*  Yes, so it comes out today when you're if you're hearing this it's on 800 pound gorilla is the name of the production company

*  Hopefully you can search it. Yeah, hopefully you know well fuck your algorithm
*  We'll see after some of this guy Trump interview. Oh, yeah, let's say can we watch this?

*  Can we watch the trailer? Is that all right? Yes, watch the trail and we'll wrap this up. Everybody go see

*  I've never heard of you. You're not famous. You're not even famous
*  And then I have one bad day and it's like famous comedian crashes car fights cop. Oh my god, damn it

*  Distorted cancer
