# Joe Rogan Experience #1563 - Tony Hinchcliffe
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 12, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th17n7kjBYg)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  Hello Tony. Yeah. Salute my friend.
*  Good to see you in the right side of America.
*  Feels good out here. Feels good, right?
*  Whole different feeling.
*  Feels normal. Yeah.
*  People aren't terrified. Correct.
*  They got everybody scared as fuck in California.
*  It's horrible, man. Everything's shut down.
*  Everything feels bad.
*  It's sad. It is sad.
*  The more businesses are completely closed, the sadder it is.
*  It's seeing stuff that you know.
*  Yeah.
*  In the memories that you have there.
*  It's also, I think it's harder to bounce back in big places.
*  I think it's harder for big places to bounce back.
*  Because you get like all these stores closed down.
*  Like all the stores that got hit hard with the looting on Melrose.
*  Like they're still closed, right?
*  Most of them.
*  Have any of them come back?
*  Yeah.
*  When you drive down, the last time I was there, it's like board it up, board it up, board it up.
*  Four lease, four lease, four lease.
*  I'm like, this takes a long time to come back.
*  It feels that way for sure.
*  Some places are open, but it's not the same vibe.
*  Yeah. Out here, they're not interested in shutting things down the same way.
*  Especially the governor.
*  He's like, we've got to keep businesses open.
*  And he's right.
*  You can do it safely.
*  I mean, I think you could do it safely here better than California because there's lower numbers.
*  There's less people.
*  There's not just, you know, everyone's on is smushed in together and everyone's more relaxed because of that.
*  It makes you realize when you come to a place that has less humans, it makes you realize like, oh, that's better.
*  Like there's plenty of people out here.
*  It's not like we're in the farms in the country in the middle of nowhere in the mountains.
*  It's not like that.
*  It's a city, but it's a less populated city and everything's just a little more.
*  Yeah. Relaxed.
*  L.A. is a giant county.
*  People think it's a city and it's just a massive, huge place.
*  And it smushes in with Orange County, which is even more populated.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  How is our no, not L.A. is probably more populated than Orange County, but Orange County is so dense, though.
*  There's the traffic in Orange County on the 405 is mind blowing.
*  It's mind blowing.
*  Yeah. Like when you're driving down to San Diego and you just like, where are all these people?
*  Where are all these people coming from?
*  Right. There's so many of them in North, too.
*  I went up to Pebble Beach a couple of weeks ago.
*  And traffic's just crazy.
*  I mean, six lanes.
*  You're all in with the golf.
*  And look at you.
*  Unbelievable. You took a trip to Pebble Beach.
*  I'm telling you, dude, it's the greatest thing out of nowhere.
*  I went to go smoke pot with my buddy Pete one day.
*  And then, you know, he's like, yeah, I'm golfing.
*  I'm like, great. I'll smoke pot with you there.
*  I figured I would just drive the cart and have fun.
*  The rest is history.
*  Addicted.
*  I caught myself the other day watching a thing on the TV like golf lessons or whatever.
*  And at the same time, I was on my iPad on YouTube, not realizing I was doing two at once, learning how to chip.
*  It's so much very dangerous.
*  It's why I never played.
*  Why is it dangerous?
*  Because it's a suck of time.
*  It sucks time.
*  Not that it's bad.
*  People enjoy it.
*  And as far as like activities that suck time.
*  I mean, at least you're walking around.
*  You're out in nature.
*  You got all that beautiful green grass, you know, there's positives to it.
*  It's definitely an interesting thing to suck time because it gives me energy.
*  And when I'm away from it, I can think more clearly about everything else.
*  It's like it's very meditative.
*  You're always thinking about your next shot or your last shot, what you did wrong, what you could have done better for the next one.
*  So it's like when I'm out there, it's I'm not looking at my phone for four or five hours, which is great.
*  I'm not thinking about anything else.
*  So that when I do afterwards and, you know, normally most days, if I don't do that, I sort of like crash out around evening time.
*  But if it's a golf day, even if I'm up at six, five, seven a.m., I have energy all day, all night after that.
*  Those are the best days now.
*  Yeah, it's probably like every like archery is like that.
*  It's meditative. Yeah.
*  It helps clear your mind because it's so difficult.
*  Right. You're concentrating so hard on each individual putt and shot.
*  I say it right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  We call them shots drives.
*  It depends on what you're shooting.
*  The drive is about your knowledge. Yeah.
*  The drive is from the tee. That's the first shot.
*  That's power. Hopefully some accuracy or aiming for the middle.
*  Is that the hardest to get good at?
*  No. Pudding is the hardest. Really?
*  Yeah. What about miniature golf? It's all touch.
*  Pudding is the most like archery.
*  Miniature golf isn't really the same.
*  No, on the golf course, there's no windmill to knock it back at you.
*  You got to get it up that ramp. That ramp's narrow.
*  The ramp? Yeah, the ramp. Oh, yeah.
*  To get to the windmill.
*  Right. You got to get it in the clown's mouth.
*  Just like at Pebble Beach.
*  I'm like, excuse me, where are your clowns?
*  There's no other sport that's worth millions of dollars if you're the best that also has a miniature version that little kids play.
*  Right? Like a fucked up version with all like bumpers everywhere and weird holes.
*  It's fun, though.
*  It's on concrete with fucking fake grass over it.
*  Right? Yeah.
*  There's no, I guess there's bumper pool, but pool's not nearly as popular as golf in terms of money.
*  Golfers make legit cash.
*  Bryson DeChambeau.
*  You know who that is?
*  Powerful drive.
*  423 yard drive. That is insanity. That's so far.
*  And he did this on purpose. There's like an interview recently about him because he's been getting popularity.
*  He like decided to like get jacked.
*  He hits it 40, 50 yards farther than Tiger Woods ever did.
*  Jesus.
*  So he's just decided to get really big. He looks like a football player.
*  Yeah.
*  Who's that one dude that does the thing at the driving ranges where he steps his leg up in the air like he's throwing a pitch and then he steps forward?
*  Crazy torque. He's got this crazy move he does where he lifts his leg up and then he steps into it and wax it.
*  Yeah, there's videos of him on YouTube. We've actually talked about him before.
*  I don't think he's hitting it that far, though.
*  I don't think anybody's hitting it 423. Maybe some weird pro driver guy.
*  But yeah, this guy's a freak.
*  Well, also this guy's accurate. I mean, he's hitting it exactly in the middle. Look where it lands.
*  And he just won the Masters, I do believe.
*  No, that's what's going on right now. He won the US Open.
*  Yeah, the US Open. And what's crazy about him, so what's crazy about the sport of golf is that that's your first shot.
*  And then after that touch, as you get closer to the whole touch becomes so much more important.
*  So this guy can do that and he can also make a 10 foot putt that has a hill from right to left and then bends from left to right.
*  There's a comparison, I guess, to pool the brake shot.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like some guys have crazy break shots, like with a lot of power.
*  And then afterwards, it's a touch and finesse game.
*  Right. And some guys might get in their head on the eight ball, which is every hole, every putt.
*  It's the most frustrating yet rewarding part.
*  Also, you guys, you're not playing on flat surface. You got little hills you have to like look at.
*  You got to get low and try to figure out where you hit it on the hill and make it drop into the hole.
*  And in the morning, because the ground's moist, especially in California, they water everything and then you're just in a desert.
*  So if you start at, say, seven or eight a.m., it's pretty straight.
*  Like there's not. And also it's slower because it's wet.
*  Right. And by 10, 11, 12, once the heat kicks up, things are moving much faster.
*  So you have to adjust throughout the day for from slow to fast and all these things.
*  So it changed. Every hole literally changes as it goes on.
*  Yeah, that that's the same with pool with moisture.
*  If you're playing in a place that has a lot of moisture, like some of the best players on earth come from the Philippines.
*  And what happened is soldiers, I believe in the Second World War, brought over to the Philippines pool.
*  They taught them pool and they play a lot of pool outside.
*  So they have these outside areas like chickens running around and shit.
*  And they're playing pool like a lot of open air pool tables.
*  And it's obviously it's an island. So it's near the oceans, probably a lot of humidity in the air and the tables.
*  They also have this weird thing they do with a poor powder on the rails.
*  So like they have like baby powder because the tables, everything gets so slick because it's wet and sweaty and sticky and moist.
*  So they put baby powder near the pockets and they all touch the baby powder on their fingers.
*  And then, you know, the Q runs smoothly through your hand.
*  But then you're always touching the table. So you're putting baby powder all over the table.
*  So the table gets really dirty. So they're playing on these like dirty, slow, wet tables.
*  And so they develop these like real fluid strokes because they're so used to having to power the ball around these disgusting tables.
*  Like not disgusting, but you would be upset if you played on a table like that in America.
*  You'd say, why don't you guys clean the table? But over there, they don't give a fuck.
*  Also, they don't give a fuck if there's a bunch of people around the table.
*  So they have these games and I watch these games.
*  Like if you looked at my YouTube feed, you'd fucking laugh because like the suggested videos, the vast majority of them are Filipino pool.
*  I watch Efraim Reyes. If you look at Jeff Galing production, Jeff Galing is a guy who films.
*  He saw like simple stuff. They film it like with a tripod and a cell phone.
*  And then they just film these pool matches and people get obsessed with watching Efraim Reyes play these young guns in the Philippines.
*  Efraim Reyes is probably the greatest pool player of all time, like pretty widely regarded.
*  He's like the Hicks and Gracie of pool. And he's playing these.
*  He looks like Manny Pacquiao, right?
*  Manny Pacquiao is a killer, by the way. Manny Pacquiao is a killer pool player.
*  Really?
*  Oh my God. World class. Like Manny Pacquiao could play professional.
*  Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Like he gambles with professionals.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah. My friend Max Eberle, who's you met Max. I think so.
*  I know you have. He's a legit pro. Like Max is like world champion caliber pro and he's gambled with Manny Pacquiao.
*  And he said Manny Pacquiao is good. He says you have to really bear down to beat him.
*  Like they play a race to 10. He might beat Manny because Max is world class, but he might beat Manny like 10 to 7 or 10 to 6.
*  Whereas he beat me like 10 to 1 or 10 to 2. Like Manny's much better than me. He's really good.
*  Manny is better than you at pool. Yeah. Yeah. He's legit.
*  There's Manny right there. Yeah, dude. He, look at that. Whoa.
*  Kick that ball in son. Wow. And get positioned on the six. He's he's super legit, super legit.
*  And he's got a great stroke and he's also left handed. I think there's a thing about left handed people.
*  And I say this as a right handed person. I think generally they're better at shit.
*  I agree. My one of my best golf buddies who helps me get a lot better because he's great.
*  Look how good he is. Dude, seriously. Look how fucking good he is. He bumped the eight.
*  I don't know if he got positioned on the five there. He might have fucked that up, but he plays really good.
*  Yeah. Like like like I said, if I saw him in a tournament and I didn't know his Manny Pacquiao, I'd be like, oh, this guy's really good.
*  He's a pro. He's essentially a pro. But that's also because he's from the Philippines and the Philippines.
*  Look how good he gets. Look, perfect position on the seven. Watch this. Seven to the eight, eight to the 10 and he's out.
*  Ten ball. Watch this. Pop. If you watch how he strokes the ball, like everything super precise.
*  Look at his position. That's he's a professional, like a legit professional.
*  So if Manny decides to retire from from fighting and goes into professional pool, he might win some world championships like no bullshit.
*  I mean, he's still fighting actively. They're actually talking about him fighting Conor McGregor right now, which is kind of bonkers.
*  That gets out beautiful position. Why do you say it's kind of bonkers?
*  Because you think Manny would dominate Conor?
*  Is that a question? You know, one of the greatest boxers of all time against a guy with one professional boxing match.
*  I agree. And I'm a huge Manny Pacquiao fan. But but here is a but I can't believe it.
*  The other week, I rewatched McGregor Mayweather since it's been like done.
*  I just was on my Showtime app and I wanted to watch some boxing. It popped up and I clicked on it.
*  And I did not remember. I remembered Conor shocking me with how good he did.
*  I did not remember it being as close as it truly was.
*  Let me explain something. The reason why it was close is because Mayweather let him blow his wad.
*  Right. He just let him look. He clipped Mayweather with legit, legit left uppercut early in the fight.
*  And I was kind of stunned. I was like, wow, that's really legit. Watch this. Here we go.
*  See what Conor. Look at that. If you see it, watch this left uppercut. If you see if you don't get that replay, that's really quick.
*  Oh, so let's rewind a little bit just so I could see it because it's really, really good.
*  I mean, I know that left uppercut. Here's the thing.
*  Here's the thing. Mayweather had to figure out Conor's timing because what Conor is, Conor is not a professional boxer.
*  OK, so because he's not a professional boxer, he's not as efficient and he's going to get tired easier.
*  Mayweather is one of the greatest, if not the greatest boxer of all time.
*  I say there's a real good argument he's the greatest of all time because he's undefeated, 50 and 0,
*  and really only been hurt by Sugar Shane Mosley and Maidana, two guys in a spectacular career, 50 and 0,
*  and just gets hit less than anybody. And he's super smart about how he sets up fights.
*  He sets up one of these. He does his talks a mess of shit and gets everybody wanting to root for him to lose.
*  He'll show you all his Rolls Royces, he'll show you all his money, he'll show you all his watches.
*  And everybody's like, he's going to go broke. He's going to go broke. But he never does. He keeps making money.
*  He keeps making money. So because if you look at his style, he's got a brilliant style.
*  His style is take the minimal amount of damage, find your openings, and then establish your game and then dominate.
*  And that's what he's done to everybody. That's what he did to Manny Pacquiao and their fight.
*  And Manny Pacquiao apparently had a fucked up shoulder, but that's what he did to Ricky Hatton, dominated Ricky Hatton,
*  who at the time was one of the best in the world and a guy that a lot of people were interested in seeing how he would do against Mayweather.
*  And then the second fight with Maidana, you get to see the brilliance of Mayweather, because he knew he got clipped in the first fight.
*  So he digested all of Maidana's movements and what he did wrong in the first fight, and he came out in the second fight and just put on a clinic.
*  He's the best of all time. But Connor is a freak. He's an explosive guy.
*  He's so fast and there's no remedy for that other than getting a guy tired.
*  So what Mayweather was doing was boxing with him, but preserving, being safe, got clipped a couple of times, realized that Connor can punch.
*  Connor can punch, but just drag him in the deep water, drag him in deep water.
*  And that's what a guy like Mayweather would do.
*  He's the most he's the most intelligent in terms of his overall strategy to preserve his health yet to always win.
*  I mean, he's the most intelligent. He's so good.
*  You know, all the greats have suffered losses and setbacks and except him. Yeah, except him.
*  We don't even know what it's like. I mean, you don't even know how he would recover.
*  We know he's had tough fights. He's had a couple of tough fights.
*  But, dude, he's so goddamn good. He's so protected. He knows where to be and where not to be.
*  He's so composed. Like, look at that. Look at that. Look at that movement.
*  Look how he moves away from everything. So you're punching at air and you're still threatening, but you're not really hitting him.
*  I mean, he's making you throw punches and occasionally you clip him with a shot as he's moving away and he rolls with a lot of shit.
*  So it's really you got to be a guy like like Sugar Shane Mosley clipped him, really clipped him, like really hurt him.
*  And he just grabbed a hold of him, held on to him and eventually started kicking Sugar Shane's ass. Just took time.
*  He's if you're a young boxer and you want to know what it's like to be a 41 year old and still be at the top of your game, you got to be like him or like Bernard Hopkins.
*  When Bernard Hopkins was at the top of his game, he was older. He was like in his 40s.
*  He was I think he was 36 when he beat Felix Trinidad. And a lot of people like Bernard Dunn, it's over.
*  Felix Trinidad, Tito Trinidad is the future. And he let Felix Trinidad on fire.
*  And then the same thing with Kelly Pavlik. He lit Kelly Pavlik on fire.
*  I was not expecting that. We were expecting that to be Kelly Pavlik's big like return.
*  And he got smashed.
*  Bernard Hopkins is a national treasure. Yeah.
*  He's because what he look at that Connor pops him with that jab and that was uncomfortable.
*  But it's like he's look how calm he is. Stop. Back that up. Back that up a second.
*  Look how goddamn calm he is. Watch his jab come to Floyd's face.
*  He doesn't even blink. It touches him in the nose, but he knows it's not going to hurt him.
*  Look at this. Watch this. Look at this. Look at this. He doesn't even move.
*  He doesn't even move. He's a master of distance. He really is a master of distance.
*  Bernard was a master of distance too. And Bernard was a different kind of style, different kind of defensive style.
*  Bernard like would frustrate guys a lot. We clinch with them, tie you up, make it very physical.
*  And guys get real frustrated and they didn't know what to do.
*  And they just wanted to fucking start winging punches.
*  And then you get right in your face again and clinch a hold of you.
*  But then break with you and catch you with a left hook. Break. Catch you with the right hand.
*  Always defensive. Always protected. Always disciplined.
*  Frustrating your opponent in boxing is one of the interesting things, right?
*  Like Holyfield Tyson. It's crazy. Everybody remembers the ear bite.
*  But not a lot of people talk about the massive amount of clinching and headbutts that Holyfield was landing on him in that fight.
*  It's very clear when you watch it again.
*  Well, the headbutts are interesting. It's like the question is, did he do it on purpose?
*  And that's what Tyson was saying, that he's doing this on purpose.
*  He's trying to cut me and he's cutting my face and cut Tyson. And that's when Tyson bit his ear.
*  And Tyson's idea at the time at least was that he was doing it on purpose.
*  But it's also like his style. His style is to put his face, put his head on your chest.
*  Put his forehead on your chest and just make it a test of wills.
*  Very few human beings have the kind of will that Evander Holyfield has.
*  You ever watch the Riddick Bowe fights?
*  Yeah.
*  Those are crazy to watch because Riddick Bowe was way bigger than Holyfield.
*  You got to remember Holyfield is a cruiserweight champion.
*  So Holyfield, I want to say he fought light heavyweight in the Olympics.
*  I might be wrong about that.
*  I want to say he fought at like 176 in the Olympics.
*  Find out what he fought at.
*  I used to have a subscription when I was a kid to The Ring magazine.
*  Oh yeah. The Bible of boxing, son.
*  They have a lineal heavyweight belt. They give out their own belt.
*  The ring belt is as prestigious as any other belt. WBC, WBO.
*  It has the red, white and blue side straps.
*  Yeah, it's got like crazy ruffles to it.
*  And like old school. Looks like something Jack Johnson would have worn.
*  So cool.
*  It's the coolest.
*  It's weird how cool trophies and stuff sometimes get weird.
*  I was thinking about that the other day about the green jacket.
*  The masters, they give you a weird, basically the ugliest jacket.
*  It's like you're such a badass. You can wear a disgusting jacket.
*  And you see those guys when they're all together.
*  It's like, hey, they're like so happy to be wearing these ugly jackets together.
*  Fucking diamonds and Rolexes wearing a gross jacket.
*  It says his first professional fight was at light heavy.
*  But right before that, he was listed around age 21 at 178, which is around the time he was in the Olympics.
*  So he probably fought at light heavyweight.
*  So if his first professional fight was light heavyweight and then he went on to be the cruiserweight champion,
*  he beat Dwight Muhammad Kawi, who used to be Dwight Braxton.
*  Dwight Braxton was this guy was 5'7", 200 pounds.
*  He was a tank. And he would come at you like real low.
*  He would get in a crouch and guys would be like, what the fuck?
*  He'd be like way down here. And he was just fucking jacked.
*  There's another guy out of prison, so just tough as shit, like Bernard Hopkins.
*  Bernard Hopkins learned a lot of his discipline by being locked up.
*  He's like, I never want this to happen to me again.
*  There's a famous story about Bernard leaving prison and one of the guards saying, you'll be back.
*  And he was like, not me, bitch. I'm Bernard Hopkins, motherfucker.
*  I'm going to be a world champion and I'm going to get this chapter out of my life.
*  And went on to be one of the most disciplined boxers ever.
*  That's why he was able to compete deep into his 40s.
*  He lost to Joe Smith. I think he was 51 when he lost his final fight.
*  And Joe Smith Jr. is just fucking savage.
*  Like one of those barbarian construction workers who still has a full-time job,
*  but still fights at a world-class level.
*  Savage. Savage human being.
*  Did you see the fighter who had his jaw split and fought for like four more rounds with it?
*  What?
*  The bottom mandible.
*  That happens. It breaks in half right here and it goes up and down.
*  Oh, yeah. Check this out.
*  Oh, Jesus. Look at, look how it's dropped down.
*  They said it happened in the second round and they kept fighting.
*  He wanted to fight, but they had to like tell him, hey, your jaw is broken. That's not good.
*  Well, the problem, oh my God, that's so, that's so broken.
*  The problem is it'll tear all the tissue in there and then it'll never heal right.
*  Oh my God.
*  Benjamin Hussein from Australia.
*  Who hit him?
*  Ben Mahoney.
*  They said it dislodged. They thought it just dislodged his mouthpiece and then a bunch of blood started coming out.
*  There was a woman who had that in an MMA fight.
*  Kim Couture. She was Randy Couture's wife at the time.
*  And her jaw did the same thing. Dropped down.
*  You can see it moving.
*  Oh my God. That is crazy. That's crazy. Look at the, oh my God.
*  No.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  Good Lord. Can you imagine the headache the next day?
*  I saw a video of a lion that got kicked by a gazelle and had a broken jaw.
*  That's, that's some hard shit to look at because you're like, ooh, this is not going to last.
*  There's no recovering from that, right?
*  No.
*  You're a lion because you can't eat.
*  Hospitals.
*  Right? No lion hospitals.
*  They have one shot at getting injured. They get injured once in their life and then it's over.
*  So how long do you think they last after an injury like that?
*  Dead. Dead within a couple of weeks. They usually start at death.
*  How do you not starve to death if you can't eat?
*  You think the lion keeps thinking, you think they have like memories and they're like that fucking gazelle. That fucking gazelle.
*  Nope. I think they hold no grudges.
*  Right.
*  I think grudges are connected to cognitive function, like our ego, our understanding of ourself.
*  That's why I'm going to get him back because it's like ego. I don't think animals have an ego.
*  They have, they have a sense of fair though.
*  Animals have a sense of, some animals do at least, chimps do.
*  One of the reasons why chimps attack people is because if people give something to someone else and they don't give it to them, they have a real sense of fairness.
*  Yeah. There's a famous story of this guy who had a pet chimp.
*  And then the thing about chimps is you can keep them when they're young and then they get older and it's like a man.
*  But a man that's five times stronger than you and like, why is he going to listen to you?
*  He's not going to listen to you.
*  So I think he started biting off fingers. It's one of the things that chimps do. When chimps get mad at you, they bite off your finger.
*  Yeah. Just to let you know, they're the boss.
*  Like they don't give a fuck if you're injured. They have no remorse. Right.
*  And they're intelligent. So you have this thing that's not a dog. It's not a person.
*  It's this weird in-between thing. It's an animal, but it's also intelligent.
*  And so when you do something for someone else, but you don't do something for them, they get rage, like horrific rage.
*  So this guy gets rid of this chimp, brings it to a shelter. The shelter takes it in and he goes to visit it every year.
*  And the chimp goes to see him like, oh, my friend, I miss you. I miss you. Why can't I come home?
*  But he can't come home ever because he would just take over the house. Right.
*  Because he's a grown chimp. They don't castrate chimps the way they castrate dogs.
*  When you castrate a dog, like everybody, it's standard. People think it's good. Oh, did you get your dog neutered?
*  Yeah, I did. And you're like, you want your dog to have no testosterone. You want your dog to have no balls.
*  But then it becomes a different thing. Then it's like tired.
*  And like, have you ever seen a dog get snipped? I had one of my dogs get snipped when it was five years old.
*  It was just too aggressive. And so someone talked me into it.
*  And then when I got him snipped, all of a sudden he was just tired all the time. He was lazy.
*  And I realized, oh, he didn't have any testosterone anymore. It's all gone.
*  I'm like, wow. So the dog's a different dog now. So you can't do that to chimps for whatever reason.
*  You can't do that to chimps. You can't neuter a chimp.
*  So this guy goes to visit the chimp and he brings a birthday cake. Happy birthday, buddy.
*  And the other chimps that are in cages right next to it are like, this motherfucker didn't bring me a cake.
*  I can't believe this shit. So they figure out a way to get out.
*  And they got out and they attacked the man and they tore him apart.
*  They tore his face off. They tore his dick off. They tore his feet off.
*  They bit his fingers off. It's one of the most horrific, cruel attacks you'll ever hear of.
*  Because they did it to try to take away from him the things he wants and needs.
*  Chimps recognize you need your fingers in order to do things.
*  You need your face in order to see. You need your dick in order to fuck.
*  So that's the things they go after.
*  Fucking assholes.
*  They don't just try to kill you. They try to take away what it means to be a human.
*  So if you try to hide your hands, they'll pull your hands away from you.
*  Open them up and bite them off like crazy with a rage-filled look in their eye.
*  And they don't communicate with language.
*  So they only have this sense in their head of what's fair and what's not fair and what you've done to them.
*  So if you do something that makes them jealous, they think immediately you've done something bad to them.
*  They don't think that, no, no, I just gave my friend a cake.
*  Uh-uh. You made them feel bad. So it's you. You made them feel bad.
*  So they'll go right after you.
*  It's like a sort of a...
*  It's an interesting study in the way sometimes people look at things.
*  Like we've all been jealous, right? You've been jealous of someone.
*  You see someone who's doing something well and you go, oh, I wish I was that guy.
*  But you don't go attack that person, right?
*  People recognize, like, it's not his fault that I feel bad that he has this corvette.
*  I have to just...fuck. I just got to appreciate the guy's hustle.
*  Guy's out there kicking ass.
*  All right. I got to get my shit together.
*  But there's a thing that we have initially, especially when they're children, we feel angry.
*  Like you feel upset. Like you feel like you've been shorted.
*  Like someone's, oh, why didn't I get that? This is bullshit.
*  He gets it and I don't. It's a fascinating part of humans.
*  And then humans, as we get older and more sophisticated with language,
*  but still carry the same childish emotions, we find reasons to be upset at someone for being successful.
*  We find reasons. Eat the rich.
*  You know, we find these weird little ways that we can justify our jealousy or our anger
*  or our disdain for those who are more successful than we.
*  So it's like we're coming up with complicated, sophisticated ways to justify these primal behaviors
*  that chimps exhibit in just violent rage.
*  So this guy, it's a famous case like this. You can see the pictures if you want to see the pictures.
*  Of the cake guy?
*  Of the guy who got his face ripped apart and fingers bitten off.
*  Yeah, I mean, he was in the hospital.
*  That sounds great.
*  Did you think that this guy...
*  Folks at home, folks at home, prepare. Don't show it on the screen because it's rough.
*  But Townie needs to see this before you go give a tramp a cake.
*  Yeah, I'm not doing that.
*  Wow.
*  No nose. See how he bit his nose off?
*  God.
*  Yeah. Look at his face.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm unconscious, they said, after this happened.
*  Oh, yeah, of course. See his right hand and the fingers bitten off?
*  That's what they do. They bite off your fingers.
*  That's the chimp right there.
*  Click on the chimp in the right hand corner. That's his chimp.
*  What is that picture?
*  I'm surprised he let him keep his ears.
*  Oh, that's the guy's face, Jamie. That's what that is.
*  He's got a trach because he can't breathe out of his mouth. Yeah.
*  Well, I don't think that, you know, chimps exactly know the human anatomy all that well,
*  but they know what's important to you. Your face, your fingers.
*  Fuck it.
*  Tore this guy apart.
*  So if he would have brought pieces of cake and given them to all the chimps and all the cages, it probably...
*  They'd all be happy.
*  Right.
*  They're also angry that they're captive.
*  So when they get captive...
*  Look, being captive for a chimp is probably a similar feeling as to what it would be to be captive as a person.
*  If you see a chimp at the zoo and you're in this big...
*  They're in this big containment and they all have these monkey bars and stuff they could hang on,
*  but there's a bunch of people staring at them.
*  Like all day long, people are staring at you through glass and there's a ceiling.
*  There's a net over the top so you can't go over the top and there's fences.
*  And you're just like, fuck. Every day is boring.
*  Nothing happens. Nothing happens. Every day.
*  There's no lions. There's no fruit to go pick.
*  There's no places to go journey to, to explore.
*  Like chimps travel around, man.
*  They don't just sit in one particular 100-yard area for the rest of their life.
*  And it's not even 100 yards, right?
*  If you go to the LA Zoo, you ever see how small that enclosure is?
*  Yeah.
*  I went to the LA Zoo once. Really high. Really high.
*  Really high. Like on an edible.
*  And I wrote a piece on my website called Animal Prison.
*  And I was like... Because it made me feel...
*  Because when you're really fucking super baked, you're sensitive to everything.
*  But just I recognize how... Instead of thinking about myself and thinking about,
*  oh, I'm going to go to the zoo and see the monkeys,
*  I went there and I immediately felt sadness.
*  I was like, oh no, these poor creatures.
*  Like they don't want to be here. Like what are we doing?
*  Like we can't do this. I was thinking like, I got to get out of here.
*  It's true. No, you're right. And it's very bizarre.
*  Same thing with SeaWorld. Same thing with all those places.
*  Oh, SeaWorld's worse.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they're as smart as us, if not smarter.
*  We don't even really know how smart orcas are, right?
*  Or dolphins. Because we put them in these weird categories.
*  Like how much emails do they send? Do they make houses?
*  No, they must be stupid. But they have a cerebral cortex that's 40% larger than ours.
*  We don't know how smart they are. They also, they communicate.
*  They have a weird, sophisticated language that we can't decipher.
*  We can't decipher it. We don't know what their language is.
*  They've been able to recognize specific accents.
*  So they know there's like, you know, like there's a Southern accent and a Cleveland accent.
*  There's a Chicago accent. Orcas have accents.
*  Like we can tell by the sound, oh, this is an orca from Alaska or this is an orca from Seattle.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's fucking nuts, man.
*  Meanwhile, we put them in a swimming pool. A fucking swimming pool.
*  It's so sad how their fin droops once they get depressed.
*  It's not that they get depressed. They don't use it. It atrophies.
*  It's like an arm that you don't pick anything up with. It just gets limp.
*  You ever break your arm?
*  Um, no.
*  When you break your arm, they put it in a cast.
*  One of the weird things is you get your arm out of the cast that's so little.
*  It's like your arm atrophies.
*  Mine's always like that.
*  I always look like I had a broken arm for three years.
*  I did break my leg once. That was fucked up right before wrestling season.
*  Got run over by a car.
*  Yeah.
*  What happened?
*  My girlfriend at the time dropped me off after school.
*  I was getting my backpack out of her trunk, but she forgot that I was behind her car getting a backpack out of her trunk.
*  So she started backing up.
*  Your girlfriend backed over you on purpose, and now you're justifying it.
*  I almost made it out of the way. It was the last second.
*  I was just spinning out of the way.
*  And then she hit the gas, right? And turned the wheel.
*  Yep. Cracked my leg into two pieces.
*  A month before my senior year of wrestling started.
*  Big senior year.
*  What's up, Jamie?
*  I'm sorry to turn this back to this chimpanzee story, but it got...
*  A little bit crazier than you probably like. You probably stopped looking into this.
*  Oh, crazy?
*  So the guy, he won a lawsuit against Wes Covina to keep the chimp in the 60s because the judge said the chimp, quote,
*  doesn't have the traits of a wild animal and was somewhat better behaved than some people.
*  It, but it like, so there was some, I was reading more about the story.
*  It ate his testicles. Excuse me.
*  According to the reports, it ate his testicles also.
*  And there was some report that it ate part of his brain.
*  Like they cracked open a skull and got a piece of his brain.
*  This chimp was later put into another holding place, escaped again in like 2005 or eight or something.
*  Because this happened, the original story happened, I don't know, 2002 maybe.
*  The people who originally owned the chimp like rented a helicopter to go find it.
*  There was more lawsuits.
*  But that, but you say that he ate his brain. It wasn't that chimp that ate his brain.
*  It wasn't his chimp.
*  I don't believe so, but this chimp got involved with like, it says that...
*  It's his chimp that got involved?
*  I think that it, like there was a police officer that got into, like when it got out one time,
*  it like got into an altercation with a cop.
*  Cops, there's like 80% of cops, they suck at fighting drunks.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine fighting a chimp.
*  Like how many videos have you seen of cops trying to pull a guy over and the guy winds up kicking their ass?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it happens a lot.
*  A policeman has required $250,000 in medical treatment for the policeman.
*  Oh jeez.
*  And Lori Allred was defending the chimp in court.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, like.
*  I swear to God, like it gets like insane.
*  Oh my God, that's hilarious.
*  It said the two chimps that bit him the first time didn't have good enough lawyers.
*  This is like in a lawyer website I'm reading about it.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  That is so crazy. The chimps have lawyers.
*  How can a chimp have a lawyer?
*  Dogs, dogs don't get lawyers, right? So if a dog bites you, they just put the dog down.
*  But if a chimp bites you, they're like, hold on.
*  This chimp sounds so good, he almost represented himself in court.
*  Is this guy escaping from prison, eating brains?
*  Tired of bullshit.
*  I don't think it's the same chimp that ate the brains.
*  I think it's the chimp that attacked the guy and tore his dick off that ate his brains.
*  They do take your testicles off. They seem to know that that's where you're comastored.
*  No good. That's not good. That's not cool.
*  That is not cool.
*  It's so crazy.
*  Well, you know the one about the lady in Connecticut, right?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Oh, this one's even freakier.
*  This lady had a giant chimp, like a 200 pounder.
*  And it lived with her and slept in her bed.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And she gave it Xanax and red wine.
*  And one day, this lady, her friend came over cock-blocking.
*  And this chimp didn't like it. So he tore her apart. He tore a lady apart.
*  Same way that tore that man apart.
*  Tore this lady apart, tore her face apart.
*  Horrible story. Terrifying story.
*  This lady thought this chimp was like a pet.
*  And then she realized, this chimp has no idea what the rules are.
*  And you can't tell it what to do because it was tired of this lady coming around.
*  And it wasn't the lady that was giving him red wine.
*  No. No. It was another lady that was telling her to not give him red wine.
*  And not give him Xanax. And he was like, this bitch is cock-blocking.
*  You think the chimp looked for testicles and was like, what the fuck?
*  No, he probably knew it was a female.
*  But I don't even know. I'm joking around about the cock-blocking part.
*  But he, whatever reason, didn't like that lady.
*  And just decided to tear her apart.
*  You just can't keep them as pets.
*  They're two, it's so strange.
*  They're animals for sure.
*  But they're also so close to humans.
*  Have you thought about getting any wild animals?
*  While I'm in Texas?
*  Now that you're in Texas?
*  Funny you say that. I have a couple giraffes on order.
*  No.
*  I would have giraffes, I've had a bit in my act about giraffes.
*  About the only animals in the zoo that don't seem bummed out at all are giraffes.
*  Because they're just like, another day with no lions.
*  And they just stroll around. They're so happy.
*  They're so calm at the zoo that they let babies feed them.
*  Like when my daughter was two, we brought her to the zoo.
*  She holds out a piece of lettuce.
*  And the giraffe come over, it's a giraffe.
*  They didn't train it.
*  And his tongue reaches out and grabs the whole of the lettuce.
*  It's really kind of cool the way they do it.
*  But that's the only animal that I would keep as a pet.
*  Because they don't seem to care. They seem to like it.
*  They're stress free. They just chill.
*  I held a koala when in Australia this last time.
*  So I went with the whole Kiltoni crew.
*  So I'm like, okay, I'll do the touristy stuff that I've never done there in the seven or eight or whatever times I've been there.
*  And we went and held koalas and they feed them eucalyptus the whole time.
*  That's all they eat.
*  And the reason why they keep feeding them eucalyptus is because the second you stop giving them eucalyptus,
*  like truly within three seconds of them not having the next leaf, they turn more into a bear.
*  Like it's like they start acting instead of being this mellow little bundle of joy.
*  You feel their claws tighten up and they get you just you feel it.
*  It's a fucking bear.
*  They're all angry. They're like cute and slow and dumb.
*  And then as soon as they it's a straight up drug like it's an IV drip of just heroin to them.
*  And if they come off, they're just is there another animal like that that only eats one plant?
*  I don't know.
*  It's a good question, right?
*  I mean, cows eat grass, sheep eat grass, but they just eat eucalyptus.
*  Yeah. Like one weird plant.
*  They smell like it.
*  Oh, oh, yeah.
*  I wonder what they taste like.
*  That's a good question.
*  Let's do it.
*  They get real country with you.
*  Would you cook one?
*  Yeah.
*  You felt like a little aggression from them, right?
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  I put it down.
*  I put it down.
*  I was like, where are my fucking leaves?
*  Yeah.
*  Where's my fucking leaves?
*  Like a fake baby.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a real time.
*  Do you remember that story about a girl that this this couple adopted and they thought they were adopting like a ten year old and it turned out to be a tiny person and a tiny person who's completely insane and was pretending to be a little kid?
*  Oh, you know that story.
*  Scary.
*  Now.
*  It's a terrifying story because this couple had this like little tiny person that in their house that was like Chucky.
*  And like and then they realized like, oh, this lady's 30 right here.
*  Ukrainian orphan, the center of an adoption scandal might be an adult.
*  Here are eight adults who are caught posing as children.
*  That's happened that many times.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  So look at that.
*  Imagine that's a 30 year old playing with your baby and you're like, oh, we're going to help her.
*  She's going to have a better life.
*  Meanwhile, she's doing heroin when you're not around.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  That might be the.
*  These are the different stories.
*  These are the different stories about her.
*  OK.
*  Click on that one.
*  Parent.
*  Well, come on, you fucking pop up.
*  Oh, you son of a bitch.
*  Looks like you're using an ad blocker.
*  We're going to cock block your ad blocker.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Why don't you just shut off the ad blocker?
*  I don't mind ads.
*  All right.
*  Parents who are acute.
*  Parents are accused of abandoning an eight year old Ukrainian girl, say they adopted.
*  Oh, they adopted say she was actually a 22 year old mentally disturbed adult.
*  Look at the parents.
*  It's a movie.
*  It's a Coen Brothers movie.
*  Right.
*  Like those two winding up in jail.
*  Well, it all started when we tried to do a good thing and adopt a baby.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, Darrell's balls didn't work.
*  So we decided.
*  Fuck.
*  Crazy.
*  That's frightening.
*  Hold on a second.
*  Scroll back up again.
*  We just.
*  Yeah.
*  Christine Barnett says Natalia terrorized her family in an interview with the Daily
*  Mail.
*  Trusted source.
*  Christine Barnett said that the adoption was a scam.
*  The girl was not who they thought she was.
*  Christine Barnett said that she and their now ex-husband.
*  Oh, they got divorced over this.
*  Agreed to an emergency adoption of Florida in 2010.
*  She said she didn't know him in many details about Natalia's background, but were told
*  her previous adopted parents gave her up for undisclosed reasons.
*  Like maybe because she's 20.
*  Christine Barnett said that Natalia terrorized her family, tried to stab them when they were
*  sleeping, and once tried to push her towards an electric fence and poured bleach in her
*  coffee.
*  There you go.
*  Get rid of the coronavirus.
*  The media is painting me to be a child abuser, but there's no child here, she said.
*  Natalia was a woman.
*  She had periods.
*  Whoa.
*  She had adult teeth.
*  She never grew a single inch.
*  Which would happen even with a child with dwarfism.
*  The doctors all confirmed she was suffering from a severe psychological illness, only
*  diagnosed in adults.
*  That's scary.
*  Natalia has a type of dwarfism called, whoa, how about this word?
*  Help me out.
*  Spondyloepipfysiel.
*  How do you say that?
*  Spondylopipfysiel.
*  Okay.
*  Dysplasia, which makes her age difficult to actually record without a birth certificate.
*  Wow.
*  Though she was said to be six when the Barnetts adopted her in 2010, NBC News said she was
*  eight.
*  NBC News said it saw a hospital record showing her age as about eight in June of 2010.
*  Oh, well that doesn't mean anything.
*  Citing court documents, WISHTV, an Indianapolis CW affiliate reported that the girl's age
*  was changed from eight to 22 in 2012.
*  It said a skeletal survey at the Peyton Manning, holla Peyton Manning, has his own children's
*  hospital, Peyton Manning Children's Hospital deemed her to be 11 at the time.
*  Wow.
*  She was 22 with a 22 year old skeleton when she was 11.
*  Wow.
*  Well, she made a career perpetuating her age facade.
*  Scroll back up.
*  It's weird that they did the test at a children's hospital.
*  Wow.
*  Natalia was an adult.
*  The document hasn't been verified but says that she made a career of perpetuating.
*  That's a weird word.
*  How often do you say that?
*  Perpetuating.
*  Her age, I don't say that very often.
*  I read it a lot.
*  You can't do to fool those who have the best intentions.
*  That's crazy.
*  Where is she now?
*  I mean, being a kid is pretty awesome.
*  You don't have to work.
*  You get free food.
*  You're chilling.
*  You get to stab people while they're sleeping.
*  Yeah.
*  They think you're a little kid.
*  That's freaky, man.
*  Imagine you adopt an eight year old and you keep like, all right, let's check your height.
*  And you do a little pencil mark on the door.
*  You couldn't even make that movie because people say that you were being an ableist.
*  You could make that movie about 10 years ago.
*  But if you try to make that movie today, people call you a piece of shit.
*  Like the studios wouldn't fund it.
*  They'd be scared of the backlash.
*  It's so sad what's going on with movies.
*  I saw some stat the other day about how they're doing remakes and like there's no original anything anymore.
*  They're taking stuff out of movies.
*  I saw Poltergeist the other day.
*  Hey, I almost went to the drive-in last week and saw that.
*  That was playing at a local drive-in.
*  I haven't seen it in forever.
*  I didn't remember so much of it.
*  It's probably been 20 plus years since I saw it.
*  But one thing I recognize when I saw was like the times were so different when that movie came out.
*  I want to say that movies it's like it's eight.
*  It was like eighty four or some shit.
*  Like when do you think that came out?
*  I guess eighty two.
*  You forgot the rest of the story.
*  She got adopted again and went on, did more interviews and said that like she was 16, not 33.
*  The girl on the thing.
*  See picture ever on the thing.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Oh, my God.
*  She looks like she's 40.
*  That's her.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a little girl.
*  She totally looks like an adult.
*  Natalia Grace Barnett.
*  I'm 16, not a 33 year old scam artist.
*  Oh, she's old.
*  Look at her face.
*  That's not true.
*  Look at her face.
*  Go back up to that face.
*  That is not a 16 year old's face.
*  That's a woman's face.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  But look how small her hands are in relationship to rest of her face, too.
*  If I adopted an eight year old and that's what showed up at my door,
*  I'd immediate, immediate return.
*  But I think when she was 20, she pulled it off.
*  Like if you saw that other picture of her, the other picture of her, she looked young.
*  Yeah.
*  She looked like a little kid, but she doesn't look like a little, you know, from 20 to 33.
*  She does not look the same.
*  That's crazy.
*  I thought we had like even watched it or something.
*  Then like we heard her talk or.
*  Did we?
*  I don't.
*  I remember it was all like flashing back.
*  Dude, I have.
*  There's a lot.
*  There's I was on my YouTube feed watching Filipino pool the other day and an old interview came up with us with someone I didn't even remember was a guest.
*  Like if you had said, is this guy been a guest?
*  Like, no, never heard of him.
*  Maybe I sat down with the guy for three hours doing a podcast.
*  Like my memories turned to dog shit.
*  It's like there's too many too many people in there.
*  There's too many.
*  It's like overwhelmed.
*  I have no room.
*  I have no hard drive space.
*  Yeah, you got to get rid of old and new.
*  It's like when you find an old joke that ever happened to you.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's the best feeling.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's like I wrote this in 1998.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at that.
*  I'm in there.
*  Like I was telling you, Ron White's doing a guest spot on the show I'm doing tonight here in Austin.
*  And he's going back looking over his stuff.
*  And today he was I was hanging with him.
*  And at one point he goes, you know, this shit's pretty goddamn funny.
*  That's Ron.
*  Yeah.
*  What were we talking about?
*  I talked poltergeist.
*  Poltergeist.
*  Oh, here's what the movie I think is what year is it?
*  83.
*  82.
*  OK.
*  So the movie is in the early 80s.
*  And apparently it was OK to be a piece of shit back then.
*  It was like super normal because like there's a scene where the 16 year old daughter goes
*  outside.
*  There's just people doing construction in their backyard.
*  And I mean like the windows right there, the parents are right there and these construction
*  workers like, yeah, look at you.
*  And the guy's got like a like a tube and he's looking out through a like a toilet paper
*  towel tube.
*  He's looking at her like, yeah, I love you.
*  I love it.
*  She's like, fuck you.
*  And the wife, the mom is laughing that her daughter almost got raped.
*  It is the craziest scene.
*  Like, look at this.
*  Look at him.
*  He's looking at her like, yeah, look at you.
*  I love you.
*  Yeah.
*  And look at this.
*  What?
*  She's like, fuck you.
*  She gave him the this fuck you.
*  This is like the is a soft finger.
*  It's a lot more motion.
*  I give to use your arms.
*  But the wife, the watch, the mom react to it.
*  She's like, yeah.
*  And they're laughing.
*  And then watch when they go to the mom, though, the moms inside, they did give her the finger.
*  The mom's like, oh, boys will be boys out there.
*  Like, if that was today, if you put that in a movie and tried to pass it off like it was
*  normal behavior, people would fucking freak out at you.
*  And at minimum, you'd have to kill off those guys.
*  What's even more interesting is that's not that's not establishing them as bad guys that get killed later on.
*  Right. Those guys survive.
*  Oh, yeah. Right.
*  You never hear from them again.
*  Which is even crazier.
*  At least if you did it, you'd have to fit it in the storyline.
*  Like, oh, these guys are going to be the first to get killed because they're bad people.
*  Instead, the whole family has to deal with hell after that.
*  And those guys are going on about their day.
*  They got paid for the construction they did.
*  Well, later on in the movie, the guy steals coffee.
*  That guy? The construction guy?
*  Yeah, steals food.
*  He reaches in, he grabs it.
*  They're like she's cooking spaghetti.
*  So he dips a spoon in the sauce, taste the sauce, reaches in through the window.
*  And she's like, how is it?
*  Earl's like, it's very good.
*  Like, no, people were pieces of shit back then.
*  It was standard.
*  It was like cute to watch.
*  Like instead of getting outraged as an audience member, which would you most certainly would today.
*  That's one of those freaky movies.
*  You learned about the history of that, right?
*  What, the daughter? The little girl, rather?
*  The little girl.
*  There's like a lot of things that happen on that.
*  It's like a super cursed movie.
*  Yeah. Tell me. Tell me what's up.
*  So, man, I wish I could remember all of them.
*  But I remember her thing's very controversial.
*  Like she should have been taken to a hospital much sooner than she was.
*  Like it was like, it was a sloppy, sloppy ending.
*  I can't remember all the things.
*  I can't remember all the things.
*  And I get it confused with the Twilight Zone movie quite a bit too.
*  Four cast members, fucking pop-ups.
*  Shut up, you're fucking.
*  That was a free email.
*  Four cast members died during and soon after the filming of the series.
*  The series. So there was more than, how many of them were there?
*  There was, I think, at least three.
*  Carol Anne, Freeling.
*  I like number two. Number two, I think, was at the hotel, right?
*  That crazy hotel.
*  Well, Carol Anne's the little girl.
*  So go back up to the top.
*  Carol Anne Freeling was the young point of the series, played by Heather O'Rourke.
*  Only six years old when the first Poltergeist film was released, O'Rourke captivated audience.
*  She was misdiagnosed with Crohn's disease in 1987.
*  The following year, O'Rourke fell ill again and their symptoms were casually attributed to the flu.
*  A day later, she collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest.
*  After being airlifted to a children's hospital in San Diego, O'Rourke died during the operation to correct a bowel obstruction.
*  It was later believed that she had been suffering from a congenital intestinal abnormality.
*  Oh, so she had.
*  Yeah, basically she was bleeding.
*  But that was something she was born with.
*  On the inside.
*  So here's another one.
*  Dominic Dune, who played the original older sister.
*  Oh, that was the girl who gave up the finger.
*  Equally tragic and unforeseen fate.
*  82 Dune separated from her partner, John Sweeney.
*  November of that year, he showed up at Dune's house pleading for her to take him back.
*  When she refused, Sweeney grabbed Dune's neck, choked her until she was unconscious and left her to die.
*  Fuck.
*  He was sentenced to six and a half years in prison, but was released after three years and seven months.
*  Oh, my God, if that was my daughter.
*  My God.
*  You imagine your daughter.
*  Like three years is not that long.
*  OK, here we are in two thousand twenty three years ago, two thousand sixteen and a half or not even because we're halfway in.
*  Right. More than halfway in.
*  We're towards the end. Summer.
*  Summer of 2017.
*  What?
*  And all of a sudden, this guy's out of choked your daughter to death.
*  I know chimps have been in prison more than that guy should be.
*  They should put him in with a champ.
*  That's what they should do.
*  Ah, yeah.
*  You choke a woman to death.
*  They put you in with a champ and they make you feed the other champ the birthday cake.
*  It's also interesting how they wrote that choked her until she was unconscious.
*  And then left her to die.
*  No, you mean killed her.
*  Right.
*  Yeah. What the fuck are you talking about?
*  Choked her to death.
*  Choked her to death.
*  I never wrote that.
*  Yeah.
*  Probably the guy that wrote it.
*  Anyway, I left her to die accidentally.
*  Whoops.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe he's just really into choking.
*  Have you ever been with a girl that wants to get choked?
*  Yeah.
*  Weird, right?
*  Yeah. I'm not into it.
*  Not into it.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't want to let that fucking genie out of the bottle.
*  Last thing you want to do is be really into choking.
*  Right.
*  You know.
*  It's like being really into feet.
*  Yeah.
*  Weird.
*  But way worse because it could lead to death.
*  Yeah.
*  Because if you're really into feet and then you date a normal girl and you're like, oh,
*  you know, I'd like to, uh, with your feet.
*  She's like, what?
*  Like for a lot of gals, that would be like a deal breaker.
*  Looking for a husband, looking for a man to take care of your children, looking for a
*  person to be responsible.
*  You don't want a guy who wants to beat off on your feet.
*  Right?
*  So for a guy who's really into feet and then he breaks up with this woman and tries to
*  get a new one.
*  It's like, feet thing is kind of important.
*  But that's, but at least that's not dangerous.
*  It's just creepy.
*  Yeah.
*  But for someone who's into choking people, like you have to be real careful to test those
*  waters.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like if you were with a girl and that's like you had a crazy relationship for
*  10 years, oh, you just fucking choke each other.
*  And you're like, damn, that's what I miss.
*  I miss choking and fucking.
*  Holding's fun.
*  Grabbing's fun.
*  Grabbing by the throat's fun.
*  Applying pressure isn't fun.
*  It's not fun.
*  Grabbing's fun.
*  You ever been with a girl that you're hooking up and she says, hit me?
*  No.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  And I go, it stopped everything.
*  Whoa.
*  What do you mean?
*  What do you mean?
*  What do you mean?
*  And then she goes, slap me.
*  And I'm like, okay, that's different.
*  That's different than hit.
*  Yeah.
*  Because hit and slap are two very different things.
*  Yeah, but they're still hitting.
*  Right.
*  Slapping's weird.
*  If you slap a woman and she calls the cops, the cops say you hit her as assault.
*  Stalk and slap.
*  I think that's something.
*  They do that in a fight.
*  Spitting in someone's face is assault.
*  There's this crazy video of this woman screaming in this cop's face in New York.
*  She's like, you fucking fascist.
*  And he's just standing there taking and she spits in his face.
*  He's like, oh, okay.
*  Time to arrest you.
*  And he grabs her and she's screaming, what are you doing?
*  Why are you touching me?
*  Spitting is assault.
*  If you're going to spit in someone's face, you might as well kick them in the balls.
*  Absolutely.
*  That is the, we are fighting.
*  Yeah, that's a fight.
*  Yeah.
*  You spit in someone's face.
*  It's straight punches.
*  You might as well have just gotten a sucker punch in.
*  Yeah.
*  Should have just thrown the punch.
*  That's the, that's the.
*  It's assault.
*  Is there anything worse than that?
*  Is there anything worse than spitting in another human's face?
*  Well, the only difference is you spit someone you know you're not going to kill them.
*  But if you hit someone, you really could kill them.
*  If you hit someone, you knock them out and they fall and hit their head on the concrete.
*  They could die.
*  That really can happen.
*  So there's a difference.
*  I don't think it's the same assaults.
*  It's just, it's fucking gross.
*  It's mean.
*  It's definitely like you're basically as close to starting a fight as you can without hitting a person.
*  But if you're going to have a scale of like murder down to spitting in the face, like there's a difference in what you're doing.
*  You know, you're certainly provoking someone to extreme violence.
*  If you spit in someone's face, you don't leave them a lot of options, especially if they have a temper.
*  Like most people you spit in their face, they're going to throw.
*  But if you hit someone and they fall and they die, it's not the same thing as spitting in someone's face.
*  Believe me, you're going to go to jail for a long time unless you get the judge to gave the guy three years for choking a girl to death in 1982.
*  But it's like I'm telling you, the world was a different place back then.
*  Like women are right.
*  How about that?
*  Like I know a lot of these feminists went crazy and some of them went way over the edge to the point where they actually don't like men.
*  But they're right.
*  You watch watch movies like that and you see a woman who got choked to death and the guy only got three years and she was a movie star.
*  Right.
*  She was in poltergeist and she got choked to death and guys still only got three and a half years.
*  Crazy.
*  Being a woman for most of history must have been fucking terrifying for most of history.
*  Still terrifying.
*  But for most of history, like you hook up with a guy, you got to really worry about this guy killing you.
*  It's probably not going to happen one out of 100 times.
*  But one out of 100 is like.
*  Yeah, like who's that chick that died while hanging out with Christopher Walken and whoever?
*  Huh?
*  Yeah, the girl that was murdered.
*  Jack Wagner.
*  Is that a name?
*  How come you haven't had any of your drink?
*  It's like pure diesel fuel.
*  Texas whiskey.
*  Is that what this is?
*  Cheers.
*  I don't know.
*  I need California pussy whiskey.
*  Well, there's a bunch of those stories like Natalie Wood.
*  Is that it?
*  That's the one, right?
*  She drowned on a boat.
*  Christopher Walken was there.
*  Robert Wagner, I think, was the one who people were pointing the finger at.
*  But Christopher Walken, I think, was like hanging out.
*  They're like all on the boat or something.
*  I was there.
*  Not paying attention.
*  Seems weird that he just.
*  Here I am on a boat.
*  Seems like he would be.
*  Yeah, Natalie Wood's death.
*  Christopher Walken breaks his silence.
*  Oh, they were arguing.
*  It's true.
*  I watched him the other day.
*  I just watched a preview of that movie where he can see the future or holds people's hands.
*  Was it called Dead Zone?
*  Was that what it is?
*  I don't know.
*  Stephen King book?
*  I think it's the Dead Zone.
*  Yeah, that was wild.
*  He was so young, baby faced.
*  And there was a guy in it who was played by Michael Sheen, who was going to be the president,
*  a crazy egomaniac president.
*  And he wanted to detonate nukes.
*  He wanted to start a nuclear war.
*  Christopher Walken could see the future.
*  There he is.
*  He died and came back to life.
*  And when he came back to life, he could see the future when he touched your hand, like
*  he holds your hand and he could see what's going to happen to you.
*  What a badass.
*  Look at young Christopher Walken.
*  Look at that fucking guy.
*  Oh, he's great.
*  He's been great forever.
*  Him and Harvey Keitel, they don't get enough love.
*  Christopher Walken's been in so many great movies, man.
*  What's that vampire movie?
*  Scroll down.
*  What is that?
*  What the fuck is that movie?
*  Seven.
*  Sleepy Hollow.
*  Sleepy Hollow.
*  Oh, wow.
*  No shit.
*  I don't remember that at all.
*  There's too many movies.
*  Tim Burton just watched Beetlejuice for the first time in a while.
*  Oh, it's a classic.
*  It's so good.
*  My family and I, we watched Nightmare Before Halloween or Nightmare Before Christmas.
*  Yeah.
*  Watch that every year.
*  That's great.
*  It's fucking fantastic.
*  And it's incredible.
*  While watching Beetlejuice, I was thinking about what we were talking about earlier about
*  what executive would make that today, not knowing that it's a hit.
*  Never.
*  Just like, okay, so there's this couple that dies and they're like, okay, well, at least
*  they're not a likable couple, right?
*  No, super, super likable couple.
*  They die within the first five minutes of the film.
*  And then they go back to their head.
*  There's a couple of people that want to buy the house after they die.
*  They take over the house.
*  It's basically a creepy movie about real estate and them not listening to the leader of purgatory
*  that tells them to do anything but say Beetlejuice three times, but they do.
*  The exec would be like, what are you talking about?
*  Get out of here.
*  Beetlejuice?
*  Okay, pal.
*  Great.
*  Yeah, we'll let you know.
*  You know what I watched again recently?
*  Coraline.
*  Did you ever see that?
*  I think that's Tim Burton as well.
*  99% sure.
*  It's amazing.
*  It's really good.
*  It's really creepy animated.
*  Like, no, it's not.
*  Who is it?
*  It's not Tim Burton.
*  Henry Selig.
*  Tim Burton's not involved at all.
*  Double checking to make sure you didn't like produce it or something.
*  Why don't you check Snopes?
*  You know what else I watched the other day?
*  We've been going back and forth about Snopes.
*  What's Snopes?
*  What do you mean?
*  Watch Kingpin the other day.
*  Oh, that's a great movie.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Oh, probably their most underrated movie.
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  It's so good.
*  And what I realized watching it this time is that Bill Murray plays the bad guy.
*  Oh yeah, with his crazy hair?
*  Yeah.
*  The circular hair?
*  And he's a hilarious bad guy and Woody Harrelson plays the good guy and Woody Harrelson, a
*  great dramatic actor, and Bill Murray's the silliest guy of all time.
*  And it just works perfectly.
*  It's an amazing movie.
*  And it's an amazing movie about bowling.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, Bill Murray's.
*  He's great as a bad guy.
*  He was a bad guy in Groundhog Day.
*  He was a bad guy that became a good guy by the end of the movie.
*  He's a great golfer.
*  Bill Murray's here next to Donald Trump's hair.
*  Who wore it better?
*  You should see Bill Murray out on the golf course.
*  He's so funny, man.
*  He's really silly out there.
*  I saw a video of him.
*  He called over the guy with the microphone.
*  You know how you hear golf shots when they happen?
*  The guy that holds that thing.
*  And he called him over.
*  He said, come over here, get closer.
*  I want you to hear this fucking bomb I'm about to hit or something like that.
*  And the guy gets closer and he sets up again.
*  He goes, closer.
*  And he goes, closer.
*  And the guy gets right up on it.
*  And he does this big backswing.
*  He slams the hell out of this ball, man.
*  And it sounded like fucking heaven when he hit it.
*  Because the guy's right on.
*  He had him right next to it.
*  He can play.
*  Oh, I heard.
*  I heard he's like a pro.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you see it anywhere?
*  Tim Burton, Coraline?
*  Nothing?
*  No.
*  It came up that people were asking about like he didn't direct or produce it.
*  Wow.
*  Because it came out the same time or similar time as the other thing.
*  It looks like one of his movies.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  I assumed he did it.
*  Because it's so Tim Burton like, you know, it's but it's probably someone who's a fan.
*  Does like similar weird, absurd, strange.
*  I think he worked.
*  I think that guy worked with Tim Burton.
*  Here's the article that says he stepped out of his shadow to make Coraline.
*  Oh, there it is.
*  So maybe he's like protege.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Interesting.
*  Burton didn't produce or direct it.
*  Interesting.
*  Neil Gaiman book.
*  Just like Nightmare.
*  OK, cool.
*  Well, he nailed it.
*  Whoever that gentleman is.
*  It's really good.
*  But it's just a strange movie about these people that move into this house and it's
*  all animated.
*  And this little girl finds this door that's been sealed off like this little tiny like
*  like two foot door.
*  What the fuck is this?
*  But it's been covered in wallpaper and she finds a key for it and she opens it up and
*  has a tunnel.
*  She goes through it and finds a version of her family that's way nicer than her family.
*  But they have buttons for eyes.
*  The mom is like doting like her parents are writers and all they're doing is like we have
*  to work.
*  Get out of here.
*  I'm trying to work.
*  And they're like they're not into hanging out with the kids.
*  She's bored.
*  It's rainy and shitty.
*  And then she goes through this weird tunnel and all the people over there are mirrors of
*  her parents.
*  But much nicer.
*  All they're into is her.
*  They care about is her and her wishes and they give her the most delicious food and
*  they're with her all the time.
*  But they want her to have button eyes.
*  They want her to stay there forever.
*  And eventually she realized like something's really fucking wrong here.
*  And she's going back and forth between the two worlds.
*  It's really cool.
*  So whenever you have kids, Tony, whenever you shoot her a live one into the old lady and
*  you make a little baby kid, little baby Tony, little baby kid, make them watch Coraline.
*  OK.
*  Say it could be worse, you little fuck.
*  Look, this lady wants to sew buttons in your eyeballs.
*  Sounds scary.
*  It's a cool movie.
*  Yeah.
*  They get creepier and creepier as the movie goes on.
*  The parents get progressively weirder and creepier.
*  Like it's a nice slow burn.
*  Like they start off real sweet.
*  Spoiler alert.
*  And they keep getting weirder and weirder.
*  Edward Scissorhands turns into a Christmas movie at the end.
*  Does it?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think I ever watched that.
*  It's a good one.
*  I'm sure.
*  That's a fun one to watch.
*  How many movies has Johnny Depp been in?
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  They booted him out of this new movie because he lost a lawsuit.
*  See that?
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  Do you hear the recordings where she's admitting to hitting him?
*  She's admitting to punching him?
*  Yeah.
*  I guess the judge is just insane on this case.
*  Well, it was a civil suit, right?
*  Where he was suing a tabloid for describing him in an inaccurate manner.
*  Or describing his life and then he lost that suit and because he lost that suit.
*  I wonder if it's like just the optics of him losing that suit.
*  So the studio has to step in and get rid of him.
*  Right.
*  Is that what it is?
*  I think so.
*  That's just what they do nowadays.
*  They're like, okay, you're not working.
*  Not working.
*  I think they still have to pay him though.
*  I think that's also part of the thing.
*  He still gets an eight figure paycheck.
*  Oh, we.
*  Heck yeah.
*  And he gets to stay home.
*  Beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  Doesn't have to do the press releases.
*  Doesn't have to walk the red carpet.
*  He gets to just be Johnny Depp out there.
*  Wouldn't it be nice if it just the, the, the, the, he doesn't do the movie, but that money
*  just pays her off.
*  Like get out.
*  Yep.
*  Stop.
*  Leave me alone.
*  I don't think she gets any money anymore.
*  I think he's suing her now.
*  I think that's what's happening.
*  You know, he's a bad ass.
*  Jeff Bezos.
*  Got a divorce.
*  Made his ex immediately the richest woman of all time.
*  You know, immediately she became that $36 billion.
*  The richest woman of all time, one at all in a divorce.
*  And then right after that, which was 2019, he goes and he doubles or triples his overall
*  wealth.
*  So he got out right before making her twice over the richest woman of all time.
*  So she got 36 billion or whatever instead of 72, which she would have gotten a year
*  later.
*  Once the pandemic hit, probably pisses some women off at the way the richest women get
*  to be the richest women is through divorce.
*  Yep.
*  It's probably a lot of women right now that just don't even want to fucking hear that.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, can we just not mention that?
*  Stop it.
*  The richest woman of all time.
*  We're trying to be over here kicking ass.
*  Yep.
*  She did it by getting cheated on.
*  Did she?
*  I think they were already broken up.
*  Do you want a cigar?
*  I know you do.
*  She's number 22 on the list overall as of September.
*  Shut your mouth.
*  Of richest people.
*  Shut your mouth.
*  Right.
*  She's the richest woman.
*  22 for women?
*  Of all people.
*  Right.
*  Of all people.
*  She's the richest woman though.
*  Yeah, but she's, oh yeah, most of the money was in stock.
*  Why are you splitting hairs, Jamie?
*  Oh, I'm not.
*  No, I'm just saying she's still fucking got some of the money.
*  She seems like she got some of that money too.
*  Did you read that on Smops?
*  She got fucked?
*  She did not get fucked.
*  Oh, no, she made like 35 billion, right?
*  Didn't she?
*  Yeah, yeah, but I was saying like the point was that he got her out before the whole stock
*  went up.
*  Like she just went up with the stock also.
*  He knew what was coming.
*  He probably did.
*  Probably did.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, here you go.
*  35?
*  35 billion?
*  Okay.
*  She was the third wealthiest woman in the world.
*  Now she's the most, whatever, how it's gone up in just a year.
*  She gave a bunch of money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation too.
*  Like I think some Billies.
*  Crazy.
*  Gave a lot of money.
*  The giving pledge is what that's called.
*  What is?
*  The charitable giving campaign in which she willingly committed to give away almost her,
*  most of her wealth to charity over her lifetime or in her will, it says.
*  Can you take that back?
*  It's a non, legally non-binding.
*  Good change of mind.
*  That makes sense.
*  When you get older, stop having periods, start getting mean.
*  Yeah.
*  Develop some testosterone.
*  That's one of the things that you see old ladies with mustaches.
*  Yeah.
*  They get testosterone.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  The body stops producing as much estrogen.
*  Get a little more rugged, especially if you have to fend for yourself.
*  That's the amount of testosterone that I have naturally.
*  I have the testosterone of an old lady.
*  Old angry lady with no periods.
*  Same mustache.
*  By the way, I'm not a doctor.
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  I do know that women who fend for themselves and who run businesses and women who are like
*  entrepreneurs and go-getters, they do statistically have higher levels of testosterone.
*  They think there's a correlation between not just their actions, but when they're forced
*  into the role of the breadwinner and forced into this role, they actually develop, naturally
*  develop more testosterone than they would if they were in a situation where they were
*  married to Jeff Bezos and they could just chill.
*  Right.
*  That makes sense.
*  Totally makes sense.
*  People are adaptable.
*  Yeah.
*  And testosterone, I mean, of course they have to.
*  Who's going to have that type of go-getter, go-get it energy without it?
*  Like that chick from, oh man, oh, the one that tried to make the machine where it tests
*  your blood.
*  Oh, I was going to bring her up.
*  Elizabeth Thanos.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know that's a fake voice?
*  The deep voice she had.
*  So scary.
*  She faked a voice.
*  I want to hear a real voice.
*  People caught her talking on the phone and they were like, well, who was in your room?
*  And they walked in there and saw her and she saw them.
*  Hey, let me call you back.
*  She pretended to be like a female Steve Jobs.
*  She's like, I know what to do.
*  I'll just act like a man.
*  I'll put on black turtlenecks.
*  And everybody celebrated her.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody's like, you're amazing.
*  You're amazing.
*  They wanted a woman to be an entrepreneur so bad.
*  She was the richest self-made woman ever.
*  I think at one point in time, she was worth more than $9 billion.
*  And now nothing too.
*  It was all a lie.
*  Yeah.
*  It was certainly a lot of lies.
*  I don't know if it was all a lie.
*  I don't think it worked.
*  I think they really exaggerated what it could do.
*  And they sold it to like, I think they sold it to Walgreens.
*  And the thing is, it's not just as simple as they lied.
*  It's also that people got medical screenings with that device that weren't accurate.
*  So like maybe you don't feel good.
*  Maybe you have a history of cancer in your family and you're like, oh my God, I think I might have something.
*  And then you go to wherever and you get that Theranos blood screening and they go, no, Mike, you're fine.
*  You're like, whew, back to boozing.
*  Oh my God.
*  Meanwhile, Mike's got colon cancer or Mike's got a tumor in his liver or Mike's got and you never find out because this blood scanner thing is horseshit.
*  How long did they put her away for?
*  They haven't put her away.
*  She hasn't lost in court yet.
*  The I believe the company went bankrupt and then they owe so much money.
*  Like I think Betsy Devos, I think she's into them for some astounding amount of money.
*  I think she she went in for I want to say it's more than 50 million dollars.
*  And a lot of other like really high profile people got sucked into the narrative.
*  Right. The narrative was here's this genius woman.
*  Who's really like the female Steve Jobs and she even dressed like Steve Jobs.
*  And it sounded great.
*  I remember hearing the story like, wow, this chick's bad ass.
*  I remember thinking like, oh, that's cool.
*  I can get a blood test just by a finger prick.
*  Way better because I get blood tests all the time.
*  I always want to find out where my body is because I take so many vitamins and nutrients and testosterone replacement and all this shit and NAD.
*  I want to find out how healthy I am.
*  Theranos Holmes may pursue mental disease in her defense.
*  Yeah, I heard about that.
*  Yeah.
*  They she might say she's mentally ill, which is why she lied a lot.
*  But there's a really great podcast series about her.
*  The dropout.
*  It's called The Dropout.
*  It's excellent.
*  It might be wondering.
*  Find out if it's wondering.
*  Find out who makes it.
*  But it's a TV show.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's the podcast series is amazing.
*  When I was living in California, I listened to it like back to back to back until it was over, like every week when the new episode would come out, I'd get pumped.
*  ABC audio, ABC audio, whoever made it thumbs up.
*  You guys killed it because it was so compelling.
*  Like you find the story.
*  There's a guy named Sonny, who was her boyfriend, who drove a Lamborghini is a real flashy guy.
*  And the two of them put the scam together, but he claimed to not know what she was doing.
*  And you watch the whole thing on HBO, right?
*  I didn't know.
*  Oh, man.
*  Yeah, I know all about Sonny.
*  You got to watch it, man.
*  They go to work together.
*  They they didn't know.
*  They knew they were banging.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, they were hiding it, which is kind of hot.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  Pretending.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I'm so tired of Sonny shit.
*  I mean, think about firing him.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like, I think Elizabeth's lost her mind.
*  Every day.
*  Every day.
*  Send it in.
*  Rolling into work together, hooking up at night, borrowing a bunch of money for a product that was never going to work.
*  Do you think they were doing coke or something?
*  Because I think maybe when you see decisions like that, that, you know, like there's no way this is going to work.
*  What's happening here?
*  I usually think someone's on some sort of speed and Fetamines, coke, something, something crazy.
*  Very easily could have been.
*  Yeah.
*  So, you know all about this and you never watched the HBO documentary series?
*  No.
*  Oh, it's it's absolutely incredible.
*  I'm sure it's good.
*  I got the whole story from the ABC podcast series.
*  Seeing it's pretty crazy, though, because the machine is like it was just it was never going to work.
*  And every scientist is showing you it was never going to work.
*  And it shows you the needles and the glass vials just breaking.
*  It was just a pool, pools of blood in these dirty plastic machines that they had.
*  I mean, they had to get these orders out to Walgreens.
*  And as you probably know, they were training people at Walgreens with that had no cashiers that had no experience of the such how to because they ended up having to draw the blood of these people because they just kept lying to people.
*  They're like, oh, this thing isn't working today.
*  You got the pass for the the Thana.
*  What was it again?
*  Thanos.
*  Theranos.
*  But unfortunately, today it's down.
*  So we're just going to take your blood with a syringe.
*  And they had to train these Walgreens employees to tap in a vein.
*  Yes.
*  Oh, my God.
*  That's crazy.
*  And that's how they kept the con going on for even longer.
*  Because once Walgreens was behind it, they paid the money.
*  They're like, oh, well, that's at least.
*  There's something fascinating about cons.
*  Yeah, something fascinating.
*  Super fascinating.
*  You know, like I went to a boxing gym once in North Hollywood and the boxing coach.
*  Never forget this.
*  He's like, you should invest in this thing I'm doing.
*  I'm like, what is it?
*  It was a pyramid scheme.
*  He starts describing it to me.
*  It's like, well, you buy in.
*  And then when you get other people to join up, then you cash out.
*  I go, I go, you just you're you're talking about a pyramid scheme like he didn't know what a pyramid scheme is.
*  He's like, dude, I've been making some money off of this.
*  I go, do you know what a pyramid scheme is?
*  He goes, no, I go, what you described is a pyramid scheme.
*  There's no Google back then.
*  And I was like, God damn it.
*  And I'm like, I got to stop coming here, like, because the guy wouldn't stop talking to me about this.
*  Really, I'm telling you, you should invest in this.
*  It's a great deal.
*  I'm getting money back.
*  I'm putting money in.
*  You get a bunch of people to join in.
*  I go, where's the money going?
*  Well, they're investing.
*  And what?
*  And what?
*  It was like he was he didn't understand.
*  Like it's like the biggest pyramid scheme ever.
*  The biggest Ponzi scheme is Bernie Madoff, which is super, super, super sophisticated.
*  He got Steven Spielberg.
*  Really? Oh, yeah.
*  He got some sophisticated people.
*  The guy made Poltergeist also got taken.
*  See, see, find out all the people that got like famous people that got taken by Bernie Madoff.
*  It's a big list.
*  Yeah, because he was he was bringing back real returns, like real returns.
*  You'd get, you know, a certain percentage every year.
*  Like he was just nailing it.
*  And there was a lot of financial people that are like, what is this?
*  What are you doing?
*  Like what this is?
*  This is an add up.
*  What's happening here?
*  What are the odds that his fucking last name was made off?
*  Is that the weirdest?
*  It's like OJ's last name being cold blooded murder.
*  It's insane.
*  He made off with a bunch of money or or Wiener.
*  Right.
*  Right. That's another perfect one.
*  The guy always to show his dick.
*  Yeah. This guy's Andrew Wiener.
*  Is that what it was?
*  Anthony Anthony Wiener.
*  Yeah. Where's he?
*  He's out of jail, right?
*  He should be doing stand up.
*  That's a good idea.
*  That guy's a comic.
*  Steven Spielberg, the director's charity, the Wonder Kinder Foundation lost an undisclosed amount in November 2006.
*  It had assets of twelve point six million and seventy percent of its interest in and dividend income reportedly came from made off.
*  Wow.
*  Kevin Bacon.
*  They got taken and and Kira Sedgwick.
*  She got taken.
*  Norman Brandman.
*  Whoever that is.
*  Ira Renert.
*  Look at him.
*  He should be taken.
*  I don't trust your tie.
*  I don't like the color of your shirt.
*  Fuck out here.
*  Jaja Gabor.
*  God damn.
*  They took Jaja.
*  You piece of shit.
*  She suffered a ten million dollar loss.
*  Oh no.
*  She's from Greenacres, bro.
*  Goodness.
*  They got the Holocaust survivor too.
*  Sandy Koufax.
*  Sandy Koufax.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  Who else?
*  Malcovich.
*  Oh my God.
*  Malcovich.
*  You son of a bitch.
*  They should kill him for that.
*  It says most of them have recovered.
*  Oh, shut up.
*  Recovered.
*  Finally receiving payout.
*  They're not recovered everything.
*  This is finally getting starting to get money back.
*  This is twenty seventeen.
*  Four billion dollars.
*  That's a lot of money.
*  That's a lot of money.
*  That's a lot of money.
*  That's a lot of money.
*  That's a lot of money.
*  That's a lot of money.
*  That's a billion of recovered funds.
*  I wonder how they're.
*  Look at his face.
*  One of the things they said that was really fascinating about him, the cops that handled
*  him and all the people that brought him to court, like he never felt any remorse.
*  Never.
*  He was a straight up sociopath.
*  He didn't give a fuck.
*  He kept demanding things.
*  He felt he should get more things.
*  Better treatment.
*  Wanted better rooms.
*  No remorse.
*  Never felt bad.
*  All these retirees, these people that just saved their whole life and they were going
*  to put all their money in his account.
*  Oh, Norman, I think we're going to get a good return on our money.
*  And just fuck you.
*  He just stole it.
*  Stole it all.
*  I mean, why steal that much money?
*  Because that was what his business was.
*  But what's the difference between four billion and one billion?
*  Unless you're.
*  Three billion, you fucking idiot.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  When I am giving you math advice, you got a real problem.
*  But what can you buy with four that you can't buy with one?
*  Ireland.
*  But does anyone do that?
*  Yeah, no one wants their own island.
*  You're so naive.
*  Listen to me.
*  It's like everything.
*  When you're playing a game.
*  OK, let's say playing golf, right?
*  And you get you.
*  What's a good handicap?
*  Zero.
*  Zero.
*  OK.
*  And say, what are you at right now?
*  Horrible.
*  I don't know.
*  Whatever.
*  We'll say everybody starts shitty.
*  Whatever you are, you're better than me.
*  What are you?
*  I'm not sure of my exact handicap.
*  30.
*  Sure.
*  OK.
*  You want to be 15, don't you?
*  Right.
*  Then you want to be five.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  Well, when you're Elon Musk and you're worth 20 billion
*  or whatever, you look at Jeff Bezos,
*  you're like, that piece of shit's stealing my ideas.
*  His fucking Project Blue or whatever that bullshit rocket
*  formula thing he's got lying about his achievements.
*  I want to beat him.
*  Right.
*  When you're Jeff Bezos and you realize
*  like you're worth 150 billion, but you realize some Saudi oil
*  guys are probably worth a couple trillion.
*  You're like, hmm, wouldn't it be nice to be
*  the first legit trillionaire from the Western world?
*  And then you just like, why wouldn't Bezos quit?
*  Why doesn't he stop working?
*  Why doesn't he just lie on the beach somewhere,
*  get his balls massaged, and drink coconut juice?
*  Why?
*  Why do people keep working?
*  They keep working because it's a sickness.
*  Because numbers, you get numbers, you want more numbers.
*  It's one thing if you're getting numbers doing
*  what you love to do, like if you're a baseball player
*  and they keep paying you more and you love baseball.
*  But if you're just a straight up numbers man,
*  you're never fucking satisfied.
*  You want more numbers.
*  What is it?
*  Bernie Madoff asking Trump to reduce his prison sentence
*  for massive Ponzi scheme.
*  What year is this?
*  This was last year.
*  I hope he does.
*  I hope he does just for the spectacle at all.
*  I hope he pardons Snowden.
*  And I hope he pardons Julian Assange.
*  Let's Madoff out.
*  Gives OJ Simpson a full pardon.
*  What else?
*  OJ.
*  Exonerates Mike Tyson.
*  Just goes down the list of everyone who ever went to jail.
*  How many pardons do you get?
*  As many as you want.
*  Unlimited.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh my god.
*  What if he just opens up the prisons?
*  Everyone, pardon.
*  He might.
*  Donald Trump loves you and you can all vote.
*  What if he changes that, opens up the prisons,
*  makes everyone pardon for every crime ever,
*  and then you can all vote?
*  Everything except murder and rape.
*  That'd be an interesting storyline.
*  He's going to push back on this thing.
*  I don't know what's going to happen.
*  But it'd be an interesting, that'd
*  be an interesting movie.
*  A president who's mad that he didn't get re-elected.
*  So he lets out his anger on the country
*  and just uses all of his power.
*  Well, he already fired, what was it, the Secretary of State?
*  No, the Secretary of Defense.
*  Yeah, he fired the Secretary of Defense.
*  I mean, when you're firing people two months in.
*  And there was a, maybe it was New York Times article
*  I was reading about his schedule.
*  They were saying he shows little interest in his job
*  right now.
*  Yeah.
*  But what do you expect?
*  He just lost the election.
*  Do you expect a guy that played golf
*  more than any other president ever
*  in the history of presidents who complained
*  about Obama playing golf, who's playing golf
*  more than anybody ever?
*  When you tell him the job's over,
*  he's not going to make it, he's not going to keep working.
*  Why would he do that?
*  Yeah.
*  Why would he keep working?
*  And plus, you don't believe in the people that,
*  why help the people that went against you?
*  Well, not everybody went against him.
*  Right.
*  I agree.
*  I mean, look, I've always been weirdly,
*  I sort of like the guy.
*  Well, you like bad guys.
*  Yeah, but I don't think, I like bad guys
*  that are actually good guys but are bad guys.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Have you watched Cobra Kai?
*  No.
*  You should watch it.
*  That's the whole theme of the movie.
*  Really?
*  The show, the series, yeah.
*  You remember the bad guy that Ralph Macchio fucked up?
*  He's the guy you root for in the Cobra Kai series.
*  Wow.
*  It's really good.
*  It's really good and it's really cheesy.
*  In a good way, it's like watching a really well-written 1980s
*  movie, but it goes on for hours and hours and hours.
*  It's like a Netflix 1980s movie with 2020 writing,
*  but like an homage to 1980s movies.
*  And Ralph Macchio.
*  What's Ralph Macchio doing this?
*  He's the bad guy, but he's also a good guy.
*  He's a good guy, but he's making some really fucking petty
*  decisions and you kind of root against him.
*  And the bad guy is kind of a fucking loser,
*  but you kind of root for him.
*  Ralph Macchio is a winner.
*  He's got a car agency.
*  He's doing real well.
*  Yeah, LaRusso.
*  LaRusso auto sales.
*  Fucking great.
*  You know, when Trump was at Madison Square Garden,
*  I just didn't get the vibe from him that he was a bad guy.
*  Well, that's good enough.
*  It's a different...
*  You saw him from a distance.
*  It seems...
*  Jesus Christ, Tony.
*  You're the average American voter.
*  Hey, 70 million people can't be wrong.
*  Of course they can.
*  That's him.
*  That's the...
*  Johnny Lawrence.
*  Yeah, Johnny Lawrence.
*  What is his real name?
*  He's really good, though.
*  The actor.
*  I don't know what he's done since Cobra Kai.
*  I hope he's had like regular jobs.
*  I haven't seen him in anything.
*  Mike Barnes?
*  No.
*  Nope.
*  No.
*  How far into this did you get?
*  I'm always surprised by the things you end up watching and not watching.
*  This is a Bill Burr suggestion.
*  Bill Burr suggestion.
*  William Zabacki.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  I knew it was a Z.
*  Zabka.
*  He's really good.
*  He's really good in it.
*  I knew a lot of those karate douches when I was a kid.
*  I knew a lot of those guys.
*  Those never surrender.
*  Right.
*  No retreat.
*  Never surrender.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you just kick them in their chest and they surrender immediately.
*  Well, they weren't the best schools.
*  Like my school, I was really lucky.
*  I found this school when I was 15 years old.
*  I had a place that I went to before that in Newton.
*  It was Joe Esposito's karate school.
*  And he was like a Newton legend.
*  He was a karate guy.
*  It was a good school.
*  But I didn't have the method to get there.
*  It was too hard to get there.
*  I had to get my parents to give me rides and they couldn't do it in time because by the
*  time they got off work, the class had already started.
*  There was no public transportation when I was 14 that could get me there.
*  So I didn't go that often.
*  But then the T, which was the Massachusetts of Boston train system, dropped me off like
*  two blocks away from the J. Hun Kim Taekwondo Institute.
*  And I found it when I was 15.
*  I got super, super lucky because they were the most hardcore.
*  And this was in 1980.
*  It was just different.
*  I guess I was 15, so I was 81-ish.
*  81, 82.
*  They were hardcore, man.
*  But they weren't like, no retreat, no surrender.
*  There was none of that shit.
*  It was yes, sir, no, sir, honor, bowing.
*  It was like you had the tenets of Taekwondo that you had to follow.
*  There was no shenanigans or fuckery, but there was no tough guy shit either.
*  There was very stoic.
*  But we would go to tournaments and you would see those, no retreat, no surrender.
*  You'd see those guys.
*  And they weren't good.
*  That was part of the problem.
*  They were trying to make up for the lack of skill.
*  It's all about lineage, man.
*  It's all about who's teaching you.
*  Whether or not you learn your techniques correctly.
*  If you go to a bad school, one of the things that I found out when I was teaching is
*  it's really hard to unlearn shit when I would teach people things.
*  If they had a background in martial art that in the 70s and the 80s, there was no YouTube.
*  You had to find a good instructor and you didn't know who the good instructors were.
*  Some guys had bad technique, but they were just badasses.
*  They figured out how to win with bad technique.
*  But then they would go up against someone who was also a badass who had better technique.
*  And then you would see the difference.
*  The really good guys, the tough guys that didn't have the right technique, they would
*  eventually fall off.
*  It was really hard for them to relearn stuff.
*  When I would teach people, it would be real hard to relearn stuff.
*  The best students were people that knew nothing.
*  The best students were girls because they didn't have any macho bullshit.
*  One of my best students was a girl that I trained from the time she was 15 until she
*  was 18.
*  I was so proud of her.
*  I would take her to karate tournaments, these Taekwondo tournaments, and she would do well.
*  It was like this crazy weird mentor relationship I had with this girl.
*  She would listen to everything.
*  She never thought she knew more than you.
*  So I'd have like 50 people in my class, but this one girl just would show up every day.
*  Her parents would bring her and they would encourage her.
*  It was really cool.
*  But girls wouldn't fight you on things.
*  Guys, I would teach them, I'm like, you gotta pick your knee up.
*  Sometimes when the guy's close, I like to do it like this.
*  I'm like, okay.
*  Listen to me.
*  You gotta pick your knee up.
*  You wanna kick like that guy?
*  You wanna kick like John Lee?
*  You gotta pick your knee up.
*  You gotta do it right.
*  Guys would have this weird ego shit.
*  Girls wouldn't have it.
*  I would say you have to pick your knee up.
*  They would go like this, and they'd go like yes, and then turn like that.
*  And they would just do it.
*  If you learned the right way, you had a way better path.
*  So I got stupid lucky that I walked into the right school
*  and found these people that were like hardcore with technique.
*  Everything had to be done correctly.
*  And if you were off at all, we called every instructor was Mr.
*  It was Mr. O'Malley or Mr. Kim.
*  Mr. O'Malley or Mr. Kim, they would correct you.
*  Not like that, like this.
*  It didn't matter how hard you were hitting the back.
*  If your knee was low or if your knee was,
*  everything, your position was wrong, your foot wasn't pivoted, they would correct you.
*  Technique's everything.
*  You know that from wrestling, right?
*  100% everything.
*  And golf.
*  It's everything.
*  Everything.
*  Technique is everything.
*  Any moron that would take a golf club and go,
*  I'm going to hit this ball so hard without doing the 30 things at once that you have to do,
*  will fall over and look like a complete moron.
*  That's why it's so good to learn new things.
*  Because when you learn new things and you start from scratch,
*  you get to be a beginner again.
*  And one of the things that I think plagues a lot of people is they never become beginners
*  again at things.
*  And so you get proficient at something and then you become stagnant.
*  Whatever it is, whether it's martial arts or whether it's even pool.
*  I would remember when I would play in tournaments a lot,
*  there was guys that never got better.
*  They were where I was when I first started and then I got way better and they were the same.
*  Same with martial arts.
*  Some people, they do something for a long time but they never do it right.
*  They always have these weird flaws in their style or their execution or the technique.
*  But I think getting good at anything, whether it's chess or golf or playing a musical instrument,
*  I think that's one of the most important things a person can do is learn something from scratch.
*  Where you suck at it.
*  I'm trying to think of the next thing.
*  I'm not great at archery but I'm pretty good.
*  I'm pretty good.
*  I'm pretty proficient.
*  I know how to keep my shit together when it comes to the moment of truth in a bow hunting scenario.
*  I've been nervous a lot doing stand up and fighting and all the other shit I've ever done.
*  But I need something new.
*  I'm trying to figure out what it should be.
*  But I think guns, like learning how to shoot pistols correctly, like the Tarrant Tactical,
*  that helped a lot.
*  That was an interesting thing to do to get better at that because you realize
*  this is a totally different thing than anything else you do.
*  Learning from all the people there how to hold it correctly,
*  grab it really hard with your right hand or your left hand rather,
*  but your right hand you don't really grab that hard.
*  Which is interesting because that's the trigger finger.
*  But you don't have a lot of tension in that.
*  The tension is more in your left hand.
*  And all these techniques you learn from those like
*  people that win these world championships and shooting.
*  Anything you're doing man, whatever it is, whether it's yoga or any, just try something new.
*  And get better at it.
*  I play golf with one guy who wants to be good so he's not getting any better because
*  he's like cheating.
*  You know what I mean?
*  He cheats?
*  Yeah.
*  So and we all know that he cheats, but he doesn't know that we all know and that we're
*  watching him the whole time.
*  So it's one of the funniest running things.
*  Three out of the four of us know that the one is cheating continuously.
*  So he'll do this thing where he'll go, he'll find his ball, if he finds his ball by the way,
*  which if he can't find his ball, he'll just say that he found his ball and drop another ball.
*  He'll pull his cart over and then go to the other side of his cart so that we're all blocked out
*  and he'll magically find his ball.
*  But if he doesn't golf with Donald Trump, no, because that's what he does.
*  That's what everybody says.
*  No, these people are full of crap.
*  You watch Tiger Woods.
*  He'll tell you he's one of the best golfers that he's ever golfed with.
*  I'd say that too if I wanted to go to Mar-a-Lago.
*  I live in Florida.
*  I want to go to Mar-a-Lago.
*  I don't want to be banned.
*  They don't want to show you.
*  No, that's why they don't show you.
*  They don't want people to know how good he is at golf.
*  I'm dead serious.
*  Stop.
*  I will not.
*  Listen to me, stupid.
*  Don't you think Trump would have videos of him being awesome at golf?
*  Yeah, that's out there.
*  Let's watch them.
*  Okay.
*  Do you think you have videos of Trump, like you have videos of Manny Pacquiao running out on pool?
*  I told you Manny Pacquiao is like a legit pro.
*  You saw it.
*  Do you think there's videos of Trump playing like Manny Pacquiao plays pool?
*  Trump probably doesn't release the videos because he thinks people will compare him to pro golfers,
*  but to a non-pro golfer, he's a freak.
*  Listen to me, bitch.
*  I'm telling you, I'm right about this.
*  You're talking nonsense.
*  How and why President Trump treats golf even when he's playing against Tiger Woods?
*  Yeah, fake news.
*  Sure, you can go to the New York Times and they'll tell you Trump is bad at something.
*  Bro, if anybody's conservative, it's golf players.
*  So you think Tiger Woods...
*  How many conservative golf players do you think there are?
*  Is it a thousand percent?
*  There's a lot.
*  Trump owns like 10 of the best courses.
*  Understand, but people that play golf are generally business-oriented folks.
*  Business-oriented folks want better tax breaks.
*  They're the kind of people that are going to be conservative.
*  So they're going to buy Golf Magazine.
*  People who write about golf may be a little bit more liberal because they're journalists.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Every journalist is liberal.
*  Not everyone.
*  I mean, there's a couple, but nobody's reading them.
*  What's a conservative newspaper?
*  Trump doesn't just cheat at golf.
*  He cheats like a three-card Monte dealer.
*  He throws it, boots it, and moves it.
*  He lies about his lies.
*  He fudges and fools and fluffs.
*  At Winged Foot, where Trump is a member, the caddies got so used to seeing him kick his ball
*  back onto the fairway, they came up with a nickname for it.
*  Pele.
*  That's the nickname for him.
*  Pele.
*  Get out of here.
*  I played with him once.
*  Says, Brian Marshall, a longtime Winged Foot member and the chair of the coming 2020 Men's
*  U.S. Open.
*  I would say that's a legit source.
*  His quote, it was a Saturday morning game.
*  We got to the first tee and he couldn't have been nicer.
*  But then he said, you see those two guys?
*  They cheat.
*  See me?
*  I cheat.
*  And I expect you to cheat because we're going to beat those two guys today.
*  He's being funny.
*  So, yes, it's true.
*  He's going to cheat you.
*  But I think Donald, in his heart of hearts, believes that you're going to cheat him too.
*  So, if it's the same, if everybody's cheating, he doesn't see it as really cheating.
*  But that makes sense because I would think that a lot of his friends are dirtbags too.
*  One of the things about joke thieves, we all know this, they take kids on the road with them.
*  And those kids become joke thieves.
*  We don't have to name names.
*  But we know comics who started out working for thieves.
*  And those comics became thieves.
*  No doubt.
*  Because they realized, this guy's got a Mercedes.
*  He lives in a nice house.
*  Yep.
*  And that's how it's done.
*  That's how it's done.
*  If you grow up in the wrong environment, you think that that's the way to do it.
*  And I think if you're in that fucking dog-eat-dog, crazy,
*  ego-maniac, pre-internet business world, which Trump is 74, it was 50 when the internet came around.
*  Stop and think about that.
*  Yeah. They weren't expecting that.
*  Come on, son.
*  I thought you could just keep being a douchebag.
*  Speaking of cons, I saved a...
*  I stopped one the other day.
*  Stopped a con?
*  Yeah, I felt really good about it.
*  So I was leaving my place, going to get a coffee.
*  And I see this guy leaning out of his brown Bronco, yelling at this lady in the car in the lane next to him.
*  He's got a Bronco?
*  Yeah, something like that.
*  Like a nice one?
*  No, like a beat-up one.
*  Like an OJ one?
*  Yeah, like an old beat-up OJ one.
*  And it's beat up and brown.
*  Something just didn't look right about it.
*  And the guy's yelling, like, no, seriously, pull over, lady, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  And I noticed it, and I'm like, something seems shady.
*  What's going on over there?
*  And then their light turns green, and he's like, beeping at this lady aggressively that's in the lane next to him.
*  Whatever.
*  I go get my coffee.
*  Ten minutes later, I pull into a gas station to get something.
*  And I see the same car, and this guy, there's a lady pulled over at the gas station, and he's yelling at this lady.
*  And the lady's like, I'm trying to listen, but I'm not.
*  And again, I'm like, screw it, I'm going to mind my own business.
*  And I go in the gas station.
*  And then she is in line behind me.
*  She's going to the ATM.
*  And I'm like, hey, just out of curiosity, what, what, what that guy say to you?
*  She goes, I think I'm being scammed.
*  And I go, you are.
*  It turns out that this guy was screaming at ladies that because of how they were driving, he had to swerve and hit a car.
*  And he doesn't want to have to go through the insurance to just give him a few hundred bucks now.
*  Since I saw him do it to two different ladies at two different cross streets, I caught on to it.
*  And he was just about to get her.
*  She was literally at the ATM, putting her card in when I say, what's that guy talking with you about?
*  And she knew it in her gut.
*  She was right.
*  She was scared, though.
*  So she was just going to do it.
*  Right.
*  And that's how they get you.
*  There's a lot of those, man.
*  That's weird about LA.
*  You don't see a lot of those three-card Monte things.
*  Have you ever seen three-card Monte?
*  Is that with the Cubs?
*  In New York?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, or cards.
*  Three-card Monte's with cards, but the cup thing is a similar kind of scam.
*  There's a little ball into the cup, and they move the cups around.
*  And it's just like sleight of hand.
*  When you see David Blaine manipulate cards, you realize, oh, OK.
*  There's levels to everything.
*  David Blaine can do crazy shit with cards.
*  He did shit with my daughter.
*  He did these card tricks.
*  And I was watching everything he did, and I have no idea how he did it.
*  He did things where cards would—he'd have a stack of cards,
*  and he'd keep tapping the stack, and the stack would go smaller and smaller
*  to those two cards.
*  You have no idea how he did it.
*  He was just looking at them, like, what are you doing?
*  It's like he's got access to time travel.
*  And he's pulling those cards out when you're not looking,
*  and then coming back to normal time.
*  It didn't make—right?
*  I know how to do a couple of minimal card tricks, and I'm not very good at them,
*  but I have an idea of what is happening.
*  You need trick decks and shit for the ones I know.
*  I'm not good at them, but—
*  He was freaking me out.
*  I was watching him do one.
*  I swear, I was like, I'm going to catch him right now.
*  I'm going to fucking catch him.
*  I was two feet from him, and he did something.
*  I don't even—it just disappeared.
*  How about the ones where he did where the guys were holding his wrist?
*  We had our security guys hold each of his—he asked them to do it.
*  Hold each of his wrists.
*  He rolled his sleeves up, and he made these cards disappear.
*  What is happening?
*  Oh my God.
*  What are you doing?
*  Magicians are crazy.
*  He's mastered more than just cards.
*  It's like psychology and misdirection.
*  He's mixed it all together at a level that we can't understand.
*  He's so advanced.
*  Yeah.
*  I took one writing gig six or seven years ago with Justin Willman,
*  who's a genius, great magician.
*  He's the Netflix guy now.
*  I took the job because Robert Morton, who used to be the executive producer of Letterman,
*  was the EP of this.
*  Anyway, I take the job just because it's a short two, four week.
*  We're making a pilot for this magician.
*  I'm like, I like magic.
*  Magic's cool.
*  Morty's the EP, so this will be a cool thing to work on.
*  Right?
*  Short job.
*  I show up day one.
*  Basically, we're all in a big writer's room or whatever.
*  I go, yeah.
*  You know?
*  They're like, we got Tony here because he's going to add some edge to the comedy on this
*  show because it was Comedy Central's first ever magic comedy show.
*  The pilot.
*  And I go, yeah.
*  You know, I'll punch up whatever.
*  You guys show me the tricks that you want to do and I'll write jokes around the trick.
*  And that's when I realized how cool this job was about to be.
*  They go, the main guy goes, no, you write the trick and you write the jokes.
*  And I'm like, so you'll be able to do whatever my imagination thinks would be a cool magic
*  trick.
*  And like him and like four other magicians, which was basically the rest of the creative
*  staff at the same time were like, yup.
*  And that's what excites them is.
*  Because they can't even think of things.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They can, but they want to hear what a different mind thinks would be impossible.
*  And then they figure out how to do it.
*  Figure out what's an example.
*  Well, we ended up because it was a pilot of a show.
*  We ended up having to figure out a theme for just the pilot.
*  So the, for example, the, that was a technology.
*  So one of the things was him versus him versus a 3d printer.
*  In making things appear.
*  It was really funny because there was this kid, they went to this, we ended up finding
*  this like nerdy smart school where this kid was excited about his 3d printer.
*  And basically it was, it was just him making things appear out of absolutely nowhere.
*  While one kid was still printing one thing with a 3d printer.
*  It took forever and he ended up just pigeon, pigeon, pigeon, pigeon, car, car, car, car.
*  Like it ended up being, you know, it's a comedy.
*  So, but I'm trying to think of what other ones, there were some really crazy ones.
*  I think it's a whole world where there's, there's things that they understand.
*  They know what the average person like you're looking at a deck of cards.
*  You have an idea of what's possible with, with that deck of cards, but they have just
*  10 X times more options, how to hold them, how to move them, how to maneuver those cards,
*  how to distract you with the other hand.
*  I mean, I'd like to hang around with David Blaine for a few months and watch him do tricks.
*  It ended up being one of the most fun gigs I ever worked on.
*  There was just, I'd get home after a day of work and I'd find like the seven of spades in my shoe.
*  I'm like, this guy forgot to finish that one.
*  He stuffed, he stuffed a folded card under Jeff's watch band.
*  Wow.
*  And he's like, where's the card?
*  And he's just like, where'd it go?
*  He goes, look at your wrist.
*  And he's like, and he like realized like it was folded and stuffed under his watch band.
*  And he has a fucking G shock, right?
*  So it's, it's not like a loose, crazy watch band.
*  It's a tight buckle rubber strap watch band.
*  He stuffs it in there and he's like, what the fuck?
*  And I'm like, what the fuck?
*  No one saw it.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's Jamie, what you were filming some of it, right?
*  Didn't you film some of it?
*  Other people did.
*  So I was wanting, I was a big, I was a big fan of his growing up because I was like a
*  huge fan of magic, David Copperfield.
*  But like after I figured out all the fake that was moved into street magic,
*  because it's a little harder to do, you know, and that's what he was big on.
*  So I was waiting my whole life to watch him up close and he's got to be two feet from,
*  like I said, and I wanted to just, I wanted to try to catch him.
*  And he, he was so good at it.
*  He did like seven tricks in front of me.
*  He's a really nice guy, really nice guy, like genuinely nice on camera, off camera with
*  everybody, with security guys, with my family, with everybody.
*  Like you could tell it's just really nice, friendly, genuine guy.
*  But some of the stuff he does is fucking weird.
*  Like you made me shove an ice pick through his bicep.
*  Yeah.
*  What was that like?
*  I mean, are you, what, what?
*  Here's the thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, it's not a trick, right?
*  It's just pain.
*  And, um, I think the pain is just a sensation, right?
*  And if you could just tolerate the sensation, it's not deadly.
*  And one time I hit a nerve and we had to back it out and do it again.
*  I had to do it a second time because I got in there and he said, stop, stop, stop.
*  Like it hit the nerve.
*  So I had to back out and do it again.
*  I think it was supposed to be more disturbing and impressive than I reacted to it.
*  Cause, um, first of all, I'm used to pain, you know, I've been doing martial arts most
*  of my life.
*  Some always hurt.
*  I've had a bunch of surgeries and also I've butchered animals.
*  Like I understand muscle tissue and.
*  I'm not, it's just like, why are we doing this?
*  So it was more why we doing this than, oh my God, I can't believe we're doing this.
*  Like that one was not a good one for me because it's like, okay.
*  Like I could do that too.
*  Like if you want to shove that through my arm, I could just sit here while you shove
*  that through my arm.
*  I wouldn't like it though.
*  Did he bleed?
*  Yeah.
*  He bled a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  We had to stop and refilm because he had like a little bit of a hematoma, right?
*  Jamie, wasn't it?
*  Like a little building up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And so the security guys had to put like a fucking bandaid on it and shit.
*  Check it out.
*  One of them's a medic.
*  How do you think?
*  Do you think he went through the muscle?
*  I pushed it through his fucking arm, dude.
*  Like his muscle.
*  A hundred percent.
*  Not between the bone and the muscle.
*  No, no, I shoved it through his muscle.
*  One hundred percent.
*  How you can do that?
*  How thick was it?
*  The needle?
*  It was an ice pick.
*  But I'm telling you, you can do that.
*  You know, there's guys, this is one of the things we found out during the show that I
*  didn't know.
*  There's guys that would shove swords through their body.
*  Their whole gig was shoving swords through their body.
*  And we watched it live.
*  I mean, not live.
*  We watched videos of these guys shoving swords through this one guy's body who was famous for it.
*  So it would take like a long, thin sword and they'd shove it through his chest and
*  come out the other end.
*  And he'd just be standing there with his sword through him.
*  Yeah.
*  So here's me.
*  Did you see this?
*  So here's me shoving.
*  Shut up about it.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  He's like showing me how to do it.
*  But push through here.
*  Yeah.
*  Just shove it through.
*  Yeah.
*  Poked it right through.
*  One hundred percent real.
*  But again, that's not the best one for me because if you're a person who's like,
*  doesn't necessarily see a lot of pain or you haven't used to like surgery or someone
*  if you did that to a doctor, the doctor would be like, okay, I see what you're doing.
*  Just pushing something through the muscle and it probably hurts.
*  It's not a good joke or a trick.
*  It's not an illusion.
*  You're just doing something that hurts.
*  Okay.
*  Steve-O could do that.
*  Steve-O's probably done that a hundred times.
*  He does things like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Did he go to clown college or something like that?
*  I think.
*  Yeah.
*  Steve-O climbed in a fucking tree and had lions come chasing after him.
*  Yeah.
*  Like he's-
*  He's the best.
*  He does a lot of shit that hurts.
*  He did the frog thing too though, which is like another-
*  That was a different thing.
*  He swallowed a frog.
*  He swallowed a shitload of water.
*  So during the podcast, he probably drank 15, he probably drank 15 bottles of water or
*  something crazy and then he swallowed this frog and then the frog is in his stomach with all
*  the water that he swallowed and then he spit up the water slowly but surely in a bucket.
*  We had an ice bucket on the table and then he eventually got to the point where
*  he felt the frog coming up and he spit the frog out into my hand.
*  Okay.
*  Good lord.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean he knows how to do it.
*  Man.
*  That's the difference between David Blaine and Steve-O.
*  Steve-O eats the frog.
*  You're watching it come out of a different hole.
*  The frog comes out of my nose.
*  Here it comes.
*  Put the plunger to my butt hole.
*  That stuff holds up, man.
*  Nothing makes me laugh like those movies.
*  I swear to god.
*  Jackass?
*  Yup.
*  Yeah.
*  Nothing.
*  Those guys are crazy.
*  I could watch it over and over and over again.
*  What's amazing is that Steve-O walks around like he's fine.
*  It doesn't seem that hurt.
*  I mean one time real recently he had a bunch of skin grafts.
*  Remember he got real badly burnt?
*  Yeah.
*  One of the things he was doing.
*  Oh yeah because he put together this new special.
*  He had me come over to watch it and I'm telling you it is so freaking good.
*  He saved a lot of his favorite things that he wrote himself for this.
*  Did you ever see the one where Tim Kennedy choked him unconscious on stage?
*  Is that this one?
*  This new thing?
*  No this one's a while ago but my friend Tim Kennedy who was top notch middleweight in the UFC
*  put the fucking choke to him choked him completely unconscious and let him go
*  and he falls and bounces his head off the ground it's like oh.
*  This most recent one on this?
*  This is the one he taped himself.
*  He's so funny.
*  He does my favorite thing I've ever seen on this one where he pretends like he's a bicyclist.
*  You know how bicyclists wear those goofy outfits?
*  Look at the- is that his dick?
*  Yeah so he just painted himself like he's-
*  Meanwhile his dick's hanging out?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my god.
*  And all these people he always falls next to somebody and they're just about to help him
*  and then they see that his dick and balls are just painted black.
*  He doesn't really have a bike.
*  Look at this.
*  Oh my god Johnny Knoxville just kicked him right in the balls and dick.
*  That's pieces of his skin.
*  Oh Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Giant boils.
*  At one point I think he does a shot of it.
*  Does a shot glass of one of his infected burn pouches.
*  Yeah that's not good.
*  It's very funny though.
*  It's a weird way to make a living though right because after a while you realize you know
*  you're gonna go Houdini eventually.
*  Someone's gonna hit you with something.
*  You're gonna die.
*  Something's gonna go wrong.
*  But maybe not because he's been doing it- how old is Steve-o?
*  45?
*  Probably yeah.
*  45?
*  Is this a 46 or 45 when I've been doing it?
*  46.
*  Yeah.
*  He's been doing it a long ass time.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he was gonna let Chuck Liddell punch him.
*  That's not a good idea.
*  I think that was one of the things he was doing.
*  Something was gonna happen.
*  Johnny Knoxville got knocked out by Butterbean.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It was an enormous man.
*  Yeah.
*  And he let him knock him out and he had a boxing match with Butterbean which means you're gonna
*  let Butterbean knock you out because you're not gonna win.
*  Probably gave Butterbean a little bit of a thicker boxing glove on that one.
*  Right?
*  No.
*  No?
*  No.
*  No it was a regular glove.
*  Look at a nice regular 10 ounce glove.
*  And you sent him into the DMT dimension.
*  Scary.
*  It's a regular glove right?
*  I don't think it's even a sparring glove.
*  I don't think it's a 16 ounce or an 18 ounce glove.
*  I think it's a legit 10 ounce heavyweight boxing glove.
*  Butterbean who was this...
*  Early days of jackass.
*  What's that?
*  It's the early days of jackass when they were like just doing all sorts of shows on MTV still.
*  Yeah.
*  Not even just their movies.
*  Oh this is different.
*  He fought him in a ring too.
*  This is him fighting him in a store.
*  He hits his head on a display I think.
*  Look he beats the shit out of him.
*  That's legit.
*  He just beat him down and this lady's like what in the fuck?
*  Look at these people.
*  But this is legit.
*  He's not faking it.
*  So this means that Johnny Knoxville got knocked out by Butterbean more than once.
*  Because those actually look like 16 ounce gloves I'm being honest.
*  Those are bad gloves that Johnny has on because they have Velcro on them.
*  He's not there.
*  Oh he's letting them hit him.
*  He let him have a couple.
*  Oh but Johnny doesn't have a punch.
*  That's not fair.
*  And then he KO's him.
*  Yikes.
*  Terrible.
*  But there was also one maybe it was Steve-O.
*  Someone boxed him in a ring.
*  See if it's Steve-O.
*  You know what you might be thinking about?
*  You might be thinking about the Tough Enough Pro Wrestling Tournament.
*  They did a-
*  No I'm thinking about a for sure Jackass.
*  Where someone boxed Butterbean in a ring.
*  It was an actual ring.
*  I think that was all they did with them.
*  It might have been something else.
*  I'm pretty sure someone boxed him in a ring.
*  See that's why it's a-
*  WrestleMania yeah but it's not that.
*  See Butterbean KO's-
*  Text Butterbean KO Steve-O.
*  I just have Jackass and Butterbean.
*  It would come off.
*  Yeah but just take off Jackass.
*  Just Butterbean knocks out Steve-O.
*  One of the guys fought-
*  So is it only in the-
*  What's that one?
*  Keep going down.
*  The one right below Eric-
*  Yeah that one right there.
*  That's the-
*  No no right below that.
*  Sorry.
*  Same one we just watched.
*  Is that the same thing?
*  It's all giant knocks for one.
*  But there's one in a ring.
*  Maybe it's like a false memory.
*  So the WWE once did this thing.
*  They had a horrible idea.
*  It's famously one of the worst ideas ever.
*  I think it was called the tough enough tournament.
*  And Vince's big idea because UFC was just gaining popularity was to have-
*  He took like 16 of his least favorite pro wrestlers that were like on like cutting you know
*  on like the-
*  But he quickly could be fired.
*  And he decided to make this tournament called the tough enough tournament.
*  And what he didn't realize is that some people were just better fighters than others.
*  And the guy that ended up winning it all he didn't expect to win it.
*  So then he put him up against Butterbean at WrestleMania.
*  And Butterbean absolutely demolishes him.
*  Oh yeah here it is.
*  It's really sad.
*  So famously they hyped this guy up.
*  Oh the right hand is wide open.
*  There it is.
*  Hello.
*  See how low his left hand is?
*  So crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so crazy.
*  You can't do that.
*  And he's going to get up because he's tough.
*  Yep.
*  It ruined this guy's career because now he's been beaten by a boxer and a pro wrestling ring.
*  So it was over.
*  Well not only that he got beaten like legitimately.
*  Get that last one.
*  I don't think he got up from that.
*  Oh I guess he did.
*  Yeah.
*  See how they dust him off.
*  Look he still's getting up.
*  Dust him off.
*  Look he still got his left hand low.
*  Oh my god that is so bad.
*  That's so bad.
*  That's such a bad KO.
*  Go back to that again.
*  So that guy that fights over.
*  Look.
*  Oh my god.
*  That's horrendous.
*  That's horrendous.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  That's bad.
*  I just got this false memory of Butterbean fighting Johnny Knoxville in a ring.
*  Typed in a few things like just getting.
*  I was looking for any other celebrity or something that did maybe but.
*  Maybe it's not Steve-O.
*  KO by Butterbean.
*  Either way.
*  Butterbean was a fucking tank of a human.
*  He was a weird guy because he was like the king of the three rounders.
*  Or is it five rounders?
*  What would they make him fight?
*  But it didn't really have the endurance to go 12.
*  So he would go short distances but he was so big.
*  Butterbean versus Conor McGregor.
*  Who wins?
*  Butterbean.
*  Three rounds?
*  Butterbean.
*  Conor gets to go crazy.
*  Butterbean.
*  King of the four rounders they call him.
*  Yeah. Butterbean.
*  Dude he hits him once.
*  It's a weird number to land on right?
*  That means he's really tired by round five.
*  He's so big you're not going to KO him.
*  He doesn't have a neck.
*  His head starts at the top.
*  His neck starts here.
*  So it goes straight out.
*  A lot of getting KO'd as you get twisted.
*  Your head washes around.
*  Your brain washes around inside your head.
*  Dude I had a crazy dream.
*  Now I'm remembering it.
*  That a friend of mine was telling me that he's got an opening between his skull and his brain.
*  He has to close.
*  I was like what are you talking about?
*  And he lifted his skull up and I was looking into his brain and there was all this space.
*  There was his brain and then all this space and then the skull on the outside.
*  And I was like whoa you got to get that fixed.
*  What a crazy dream.
*  That is freaky.
*  I had one the other day.
*  It reminds me of that where one of the guys that works at the comedy store was coughing
*  hysterically and he was coughing and blood started shooting out of his neck and then
*  out of his ear and like each cough just da da da.
*  You know what that is?
*  What?
*  That's the comedy store dying in your head.
*  Realizing that it can only sustain itself for so long the way things are going.
*  Yeah I mean I don't know.
*  We'll see.
*  Crazy times man.
*  I think everybody has to move to Texas.
*  It's the only way to keep comedy alive.
*  They're going to keep LA on lockdown for a long time man.
*  Definitely seems that way.
*  Some news hit today just a little bit ago while we've been on.
*  Joe Biden's found the cure for cancer.
*  Not like that but Billboard posted something that
*  just for Ticketmaster for tickets about getting tested and having it linked to an app.
*  Yeah John Joseph sent me this.
*  That also vaccines.
*  They're going to have it connected to vaccines.
*  Ticketmaster.
*  I saw Ticketmaster.
*  To get into a live nation venue or something.
*  Yeah so if you're going to come to a show.
*  Listen.
*  I.
*  This is very controversial right.
*  If I'm all for testing.
*  If you can test the day of and then get in.
*  Like there's rapid tests like we did rapid tests today.
*  You do a 15 minute test.
*  The problem with the vaccine is.
*  Right now like the Pfizer vaccine if you read into it 90 percent are effective.
*  It's really good.
*  But the people that do it they get horrific headaches and real bad hangovers.
*  And what they're experiencing sounds a lot worse than what Jamie experienced.
*  Having actual COVID.
*  Tell me what it was like having actual.
*  Co.
*  I've said it a few times.
*  I thought I was getting a sinus infection.
*  That's what it felt like was like coming.
*  I've had one before it's like okay I know it's about to happen.
*  I'm about to maybe have two or three days of.
*  Nose pain whatever head pain it never actually came.
*  This is why I was like maybe it's still coming or it's like.
*  Just never got that.
*  How many days was it like that.
*  One really.
*  I never even felt like worse than maybe 60 70 percent of normal life.
*  I was like I just kind of I'm starting to feel funky whatever.
*  Maybe tomorrow will be worse.
*  And it was like not worse it was not really much better.
*  But it wasn't a whole it wasn't worse.
*  And then even as days went by though a little better.
*  And that's when when I came in I was like I think I'm fine.
*  I don't felt bad a couple of days ago but not now.
*  Yeah you didn't think you had it.
*  You thought you had hay fever or something.
*  Yeah that's what I thought because I was looking online.
*  Ragweed is what was real bad here.
*  They said even like don't go outside if you have ragweed allergies.
*  It's like it's very very bad to stay inside today.
*  Yeah people get weird allergies.
*  They're weird allergies out here.
*  There's a cedar allergy around here but it's not really cedar.
*  I forget what the actual no it's a kind of plant.
*  It's a tree it's a type of tree it's not really cedar.
*  It's like juniper or some shit.
*  They call it cedar fever.
*  What is it actually?
*  I'm looking.
*  I think it's juniper.
*  There's something that that gets you for whatever reason they call it cedar allergies.
*  But it's not really cedar.
*  But apparently for a lot of folks out here they don't get it the first year.
*  They don't get it the second year.
*  They get it like the third year.
*  Yikes.
*  I was like what?
*  You even get a part yeah it says that symptoms for the cedar fever include fatigue headache
*  facial discomfort a sore throat partial loss of smell and a feeling of having plugged ears.
*  And what is the actual plant that gives you that shit?
*  Mountain cedars is what this says.
*  Cedar fever is allergic reaction to pollen from mountain cedars according to Texas Med Clinic.
*  Oh hmm.
*  So it could be a different one.
*  Why don't you google cedar fever is actually from blank.
*  Because someone was telling me that it's a different plant.
*  I was like why do they call it cedar fever then?
*  He's like oh.
*  But anyway.
*  Ah there you go.
*  Blame it.
*  Blame it on this is a joke but it says blame it on the patriarchy.
*  There's a patriarchy.
*  Yeah I mean that's how you say patriarchy.
*  Jamie's so addicted to bullshit he doesn't even say patriarchy.
*  That's what the thing says look it says pa-tree-archy.
*  That's like oh funny they're trying to make a funny.
*  Oh tree.
*  Patriarchy.
*  Yeah what is the actual plant though?
*  Are they saying cedars as well?
*  Maybe the guy who told me it was different is full of shit.
*  Maybe he's one of those guys who likes to know things but he doesn't believe in google.
*  That's weird man.
*  Those fucking bullshit artists used to be a thing.
*  Guys would just tell you stuff and you're like really?
*  Yeah man well when JFK was killed they immediately went underground.
*  What do you think would have happened if the JFK I don't know this is a weird question.
*  If you can't say today or if the internet existed then but
*  what do you think would have been different about that if that had happened
*  during an information age like this or would it not have happened?
*  The murder?
*  Yeah.
*  See Jeffrey Epstein.
*  Here's the thing here's the thing about murders today it is equally horrific as murders in 1963
*  but there's also more information coming at you.
*  It never ends.
*  It never ends.
*  It's like voting controversy and Tifa takes over Seattle.
*  Fucking da da da da da da da.
*  You just constantly get inundated with information to the point we forget about
*  what you were mad at two days ago.
*  Yep.
*  That's part of the problem with today.
*  It's you get an information overload.
*  Like I was telling you I don't remember having this conversation with someone on a podcast
*  that I just saw a clip of I'm like oh yeah.
*  I fucking completely forgot about that guy.
*  That is like like if I had a really interesting conversation with if it was rare for me to have
*  an interesting conversation with people if I worked in a factory and very rarely I get to sit down
*  and have a cup of coffee with some scientist who tells me some really cool shit I would be telling
*  everybody about that story.
*  I'd be like dude I had this conversation three hours just me and this scientist and he was
*  telling me all kinds of crazy shit.
*  I would I would have remember all of it but I see too many.
*  I have too many too many of those stories and they just get lost in my head.
*  I think that's how we are with everything today.
*  That's why no one gives a fuck who killed Jeffrey Epstein.
*  This if you like had a national like if there was a clock or a chart rather that showed national
*  interest in the Jeffrey Epstein murder it was like 20 percent and now it's like 000.1.
*  No one gives a fuck.
*  No one's Google Jeffrey Epstein murder on Twitter.
*  You know like three crazy people that also are into QAnon and they're they're bringing
*  up the Epstein thing.
*  You know someone found the records.
*  Remember the records from the flight logs are out.
*  Everyone's fucked.
*  They're all going to jail.
*  Came and went.
*  Nobody cares.
*  Bill Gates went.
*  Did you hear Bill Gates went.
*  Came and went.
*  Nobody cares.
*  Nobody cares.
*  Right.
*  Another news cycle.
*  Google Trend.
*  Popular in the summer when that stuff came out and now back down to.
*  Down to nothing.
*  That's how we are.
*  That's I mean they probably anticipated that when they killed them.
*  Yep.
*  You know.
*  There's so much news.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah they probably just figured we can get away with this and they kind of can and if
*  things get more and more chaotic which they appear to be doing it's going to get worse
*  with that you know.
*  It's going to get even more strange.
*  It's going to get weirder and weirder and weirder Tony.
*  Where do you think it all goes.
*  Where does this crazy never ending news cycle.
*  Mexico starts being more safe the United States.
*  People start moving to Mexico.
*  The United States gets more and more crazy or you go to Canada but Canada doesn't let
*  us in.
*  It's too cold there.
*  Well it's not even that.
*  They don't want us.
*  Great.
*  I'm glad they don't want us.
*  We become Mexico.
*  Canada becomes the United States.
*  It's not too cold there.
*  You and I have been there.
*  I know but we go.
*  Yeah we go straight into a car and straight to a hotel and straight to the venue and straight
*  to a restaurant and then back home.
*  Remember we talked about this on the show when that story leaked about the it was like
*  a hot mic ABC News producer got.
*  The Epson thing.
*  Yeah.
*  NBC wasn't it.
*  This was ABC.
*  A different one.
*  She's suing ABC for 10 million dollars.
*  It's the same.
*  Was I wrong.
*  Is it NBC or ABC.
*  Let me see the lady.
*  Oh.
*  X ABC News staffer sues Disney owned network over leaked Jeffrey Epstein tape.
*  Ashley.
*  Oh it is ABC.
*  Seeking 10 million.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  I was wrong then.
*  According to the New York.
*  I thought it was NBC.
*  There was the tape they're like I can't believe they like they wouldn't put it out.
*  Blah blah blah.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that her.
*  I don't know.
*  I was a different one.
*  This is not the reporter.
*  This is the girl who found the tape.
*  Right.
*  The reporter was the girl who was on saying I broke that story.
*  I knew that story but then they buried it.
*  Yeah.
*  She got fired for leaking it or something like that I think.
*  Oh that girl got fired for leaking the tape.
*  Oh good for her.
*  Good for her.
*  I hope someone hires her.
*  Remember I think we like there's she's doing what they were supposed to do like
*  labeling things with certain whatever and then it gets just like they're like how did this leak.
*  She said she didn't do it.
*  So she did.
*  Good.
*  She should.
*  That's a crazy thing to hide.
*  Here's the tape that you're prior to video.
*  That's it.
*  That's it.
*  That's her.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah.
*  Good.
*  Whatever happened to that lady the lady who leaked it.
*  See the real worry is that they would blackball someone like that keep them from working again.
*  Someone needs to come up with a legit network online like a legit news network
*  of like really trusted news people and just give them total autonomy.
*  Never restrict them and then give them a security detail everywhere they go.
*  It's expensive.
*  Fuck yeah it is.
*  But if you think about how much money they make it like Fox News and.
*  What they want to go seek a story you got to like fly to somewhere stay in a hotel for
*  weeks weeks weeks and pay money to you know get information.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh no doubt it's not cheap.
*  Look at what's happening right now with Fox News you know people are abandoning Fox News
*  because they think that Fox News is turning on conservatives because they are there was
*  people in the Trump campaign that were talking about the election results election results being
*  fraudulent and all these different things and so Fox News said this is these are unfounded
*  accusations so they cut away from this guy explaining this and the conservatives are freaking out.
*  Right.
*  Because what Fox News is trying to say is like hey you guys this is not this is not true according
*  to them or it's at least not accurate like the amount of voter fraud is not accurate
*  or maybe it's not enough to sway the election one way or another it hasn't been proven so when
*  someone says it they for whatever reason decide that they're going to stop that person saying
*  it from broadcasting it on the air.
*  It's an interesting choice because on one hand I see their point.
*  If it's not true you really shouldn't put it on the air but on the other hand it's like the
*  president's people are saying this so it makes it news even if it's not accurate you're supposed
*  I think you're supposed to let it air and then say this is what's wrong with what he said in terms
*  as far as what we know right now but it's a tough call like if you're the head of Fox
*  and someone starts coming out on the air and saying some shit that you think is fake what do you do?
*  What do you do? Especially if he's not really the president anymore right? If like they're
*  if it seems like it's going to be Joe Biden in office you got to make a you got to hedge your bets
*  because if you get into a situation where imagine if and this is not outside of what's possible
*  imagine if whether it's Biden or the next administration whoever the fuck it is gets
*  into power and they say we're going to make laws that punish people for spreading
*  false propaganda for punish people who spread fake news we're going to make laws against it and we're
*  going to decide what's fake and what's real and so then Fox News gets fined 100 million dollars 500
*  million dollars they get they get they go blank they go dark for a week they have to stay off
*  the air for a week some crazy shit yeah if they decide that they're enemies of the current
*  administration and the current administration gets the support of the people because support
*  of the people like if most of the people are into the president and they they can like what if they
*  have control of the house or control this you know they could do it technically they could do it you
*  never know not now right now i don't think they can do it but it it's not impossible if you think
*  of the people that have been silenced from twitter right the people have been kicked off of twitter
*  people that have been kicked off of facebook new york post new york post got kicked off of twitter
*  for that hunter biden story that that would have never you've never would have imagined that being
*  possible just a few years ago right but it's possible now so now we have a new sense of what's
*  possible if you keep taking that further and further you could see how fox news would be like
*  hey hey hey hey kill that right we got a business here rupa murdoch he's alive right
*  uh-uh rupa murdoch's not alive anymore no the son's got it now right or no the he doesn't control
*  it i don't but he's still alive yeah the uh the other guy died the owner doesn't rupert have a
*  super hot wife i think he's got a super hot wife that would make sense yeah i heard she's a real
*  fox you know what i'm saying come on come on there's something about those like
*  purely transactional relationships oh yeah what's the new one
*  jagger's ex what all what come on son for real let me see a picture of her and him together
*  give me that one right there whoa oh yeah she's just waiting she's waiting well maybe he's nice
*  to her wow she was hot as fuck back when she was with mick jesus christ let me see that
*  let me see that upper left picture that you just clicked on upper left no upper left yeah
*  look at that again she's checking his pulse every day just holding on to that she loves him
*  yeah tony maybe wasn't uh look at that look at that hot body he's got does have a hot body
*  if you're really into like anatomy you want to know where the skeletons are
*  like that's what i like in a man i want to know where all his joints are i don't want anything to
*  be cloaked by meat oh there's his heart very clearly i could see it beating through his
*  weird translucent rib cage
*  how old do you think you're gonna live to be i don't really think about it
*  honestly if nothing happened if if you were to go natural causes because you're a very very
*  healthy guy what would you guess if you were to go with from old age as healthy as you are the
*  life stay wealthy yeah i'm gonna live a long time yeah unless i do something really stupid
*  yeah you're gonna stay wealthy it's gonna be interesting you'd have to really you'd have to
*  do some pretty crazy stuff i mean islands and islands right yeah i'm not into buying things
*  like that right i think um i think it's possible today to live to be 120 yeah i think with the
*  right and i think what we're dealing with now we're on the cusp of what's possible i want to i
*  i don't want to say any names but i was having a conversation the other day with a billionaire
*  a very wealthy man who believes he's going to live to be 200 years old wow yeah he's explaining to me
*  all the different things that he does and where he thinks like medicine and science is going to go
*  any any simple advice is there a secret out there celery juice or don't do all the things you did
*  in this podcast don't drink whiskey and smoke cigars i think for sure exercise it seems to be
*  the number one thing you have to keep your body moving you have to keep your blood flowing and
*  you have to keep your body strong keep your body vital there's a difference between working out
*  and uh overtraining overtraining seems bad for you i have a friend he's 28 who caught the co vid
*  and he's in really good shape but he caught it when he was working out really hard he was
*  doing a fitness instructional and he was like training way way way too hard like really beating
*  his body down and then he caught it and he caught it pretty bad he had it bad for a couple weeks
*  he's he's young and healthy so the thing about training and this is the thing about guys training
*  for fights they get sick a lot um it's because you're you're you're breaking your body down
*  you're getting to this like there's a fine line between training hard and overtraining it's a
*  really fine line and it's uh it's hard for people to find the exact spot to land in you know a lot
*  of fighters over train tim kennedy the guy we talked about earlier he famously overtrained for
*  his last fight with kelvin gaslum because he had a fight cancel he went through a full six week
*  training camp and then the fight canceled and then he got another fight come up in another six weeks
*  or five weeks i think and he went straight i'm not sure about the time but he went straight into
*  another full camp and then by the end of that camp he was so tired he just never gave himself a
*  your body can't sustain like peak performance levels for very long you can sustain a good level
*  for a long time but you got to know when to peak and when to back off and really good fight
*  trainers they know when a fighter is too too sharp they're like you're peaking we're going
*  to pull you back and so they'll pull them back and they'll say take a few days off they'll tell you
*  like go watch tv go lounge in the pool swim a little bit just relax go for a hike just chill
*  the fuck out let your body recover let your body recover let all that broken down tissue rebuild
*  itself let your body just rebound and then come back at it again but do it slowly so the smart
*  ones they're monitoring heart rate heart rate variability this thing that i wear the whoop strap
*  that's that's all about it's all about monitoring how well your body's recovered like every morning
*  when i check my app i check my whoop app and it tells me how well i've recovered from the night
*  before whether or not i'm in like whether or not i'm good to go for today or whether or not i should
*  take an easy day it'll show you based on your heart rate variability but a lot of guys don't
*  do it that way they just don't want to be a pussy you know they just want to keep pushing and keep
*  pushing and you can break your body down doing that and that's when guys get sick and if you get
*  sick when your body's already tired and compromised and then a virus gets in there and weakens you
*  even further you can get really sick i had pneumonia once for a tournament that i went to
*  it was when i was uh training really i was training like a moron i never wore a heart rate
*  monitor i wasn't even taking vitamins back then i was just eating whatever and training like a
*  terrorist and then uh i i came out here oh i came out to california i fought in this tournament in
*  anaheim i was 19 so it was like uh 86 1986 i fought in the nationals in anaheim and i had pneumonia
*  and i fought three times with pneumonia it was horrible and then the next day i was so so
*  fucking beaten down i was so tired and i can't believe i was like how did i fight yesterday like
*  what the fuck but that's also what happens when you're you you you take yourself past fitness
*  and you don't want to be a pussy so you keep pushing keep pushing but it's really dumb
*  like a smart athlete knows when to back off like an experienced athlete knows their body really well
*  and they know when to back off but the right way to do it is with heart rate monitors the right way
*  to do it is like steve um maxwell told me that a long time ago you should check your heart rate in
*  the morning and if it's more than x amount of beats per minute over your standard resting heart
*  rate it means your body hasn't recovered yet so you should not work out that day and it's hard
*  for people to do that or if you do work out you should work out really light like maybe do some
*  positional drills that doesn't tax your body like do some things where you like framing and just go
*  through everything in slow motion where you never really break yourself down but it's it's also
*  sometimes people want to do too much too soon like my friend cam haines yeah cam haines when he's
*  training for ultra marathons will run a marathon every day that's not fake like i've seen him do
*  i know he does it he shows me his fucking his uh his he has an under armor app that he uses or
*  tracks his uh his distance every day it's bananas but he's done it because he's he's done that
*  slowly but surely he's built up this base over decades of of training hard you couldn't just go
*  out and do that and if you ask like there used to be conventional science or conventional wisdom
*  rather would be that uh if you run a marathon you need to take six months off
*  he's running marathons every day yeah because there's levels like you can build up so the
*  athletes that stay in shape have a much better chance at getting through a training camp and
*  not being over trained but the athletes that take a lot of time off and party
*  those are the ones that wind up a foul i think i'm going to pee my pants oh go pee
*  okay jamie's gone too you're gonna pee with jamie this is the first time ever that i've been left
*  alone on a podcast ladies and gentlemen and i already talked too much so now what to do
*  i think that all of us are real nervous right now i think this is uh an unprecedented time
*  in history where everyone is wondering what's going to happen next everyone is wondering
*  and it's so easy to say that we need to be more empathetic and we need to be more nice to each
*  other but i really do think that that is something that we need to concentrate on this idea that like
*  people are making lists of people that voted for trump and supported trump and and that they're
*  they're going to put them on these lists and they're going to send these lists out to potential
*  employers and you got to give people the opportunity to make mistakes and you got to keep
*  give people the opportunity to grow and you got to give people the opportunity to have a different
*  opinion than yours and just to say that if you support that guy you support this or that or
*  whatever horrible thing it is whether you think it's racism or fascism or whatever ism it is
*  is i really think now more than ever is a time to come together as a country and to realize this is
*  not healthy for anybody to divide ourselves into these two groups and the more we push against
*  the especially the people that won the people in the biden camp are now like now we're going to
*  make literally even aoc wrote that we're going to make a list of all the sycophants and supporters
*  of trump like i don't think that's the right way to do it i think historically black lists
*  and lists of people that are forbidden from working are forbidden from being considered
*  a part of accepted culture it's very dangerous people are malleable and people they make mistakes
*  they fall into groups of people that have different opinions and we just got to be legitimately got
*  to be nicer to each other that's what i think and it sounds so cliche that we have to be nicer to
*  each other but that's what this country needs we need to realize like yeah yeah it's fucked up yeah
*  we're in a fucked up place yeah it's fucked up that people are riding in the streets and it's
*  fucked up that there's police brutality and it's fucked up that there's covid and it's fucked up
*  the people are losing their jobs but the only thing we have together if we're we really truly
*  are a community is to treat each other like we're a community you know you could be like if i i
*  imagine a world where there's a republican and a democrat living right next door to each other
*  and they joke around and they laugh about stuff and they talk to each other and they they have
*  different opinions what i have to tell i know i said i need like a five minute uh i need to
*  i can't just still sit here for a little bit and you go to the bathroom oh okay i thought you went
*  i did you came back when you saw oh go back and i like i gotta you don't have to tell us all right
*  i just i didn't know if you want to stop or go or what i went back to the confidence what's happening
*  jamie just he cut his p short and now his balls are aching he's got to shit yeah he's gonna shit
*  himself wow yeah i really had to pee and then i i was i had reached maximum p and then once i saw
*  jamie go i'm like jamie's peeing and then i really started thinking about peeing and i simply
*  couldn't take it anymore i understand people really you know they i bet a lot of people
*  towards the middle end of your podcast you don't realize it because your body's you know super
*  human or whatever but they have to pee a lot because people get extra hydrated oh yeah to do
*  your show and then they drink coffee and and whiskey yeah it makes you pee yeah i don't know
*  why i don't have to pee i don't have to be at all weird sometimes i do though i've had
*  podcasts where particularly after yoga because after yoga i drink a fuckload of water because
*  i do that hot yoga and i'll drink i'll bring a 64 ounce hydro flask with me filled with ice and
*  water i'll drink that whole thing during a yoga class then afterwards it's we just pb pb p yeah
*  can't stop it yeah it happens man the are you worried about the future tony yeah sure i mean
*  no more than i was two years ago really yeah it's no different it's just a different focus
*  on it you know it's different and how so i'm just uh i'm just concerned about
*  you know here let me do this let's go back to what you were just talking about
*  about being nicer to one another in a unified front is i had this thought the other day which was
*  i was thinking about america after 9 11 when we had a terrorist attack and we had what appeared
*  to be a clear enemy and it brought us all together that's probably the closest we've all been together
*  right as a country sure and then how old were you um oh boy i was in high school i was a
*  sophomore in high school so i don't know 16 15 how old are you now 36 yeah that makes sense
*  yeah that makes sense because uh i was uh i think i was 30 and i think i remember i remember hearing
*  about it going holy shit i couldn't believe it me i was 31 i couldn't believe it and then i
*  remember thinking wow everyone's so unified all these people with american flags on their cars
*  do you remember that yeah super super unified do you remember jay london yeah jay london used to
*  sell those american flags you stick in your car wow really yeah yeah jay and i uh is that pre last
*  comic standing or yeah yeah yeah yeah because last comic standing was later in the 2000s right
*  wasn't it i think so 2003 or four he was on last comic standing yeah that he had a moment in the
*  sun yeah there for a while yeah but before that he was essentially uh it was just like a street
*  vendor who's selling these american flags the little ones that attached to your window
*  you roll up the window and the flag's blowing so one of my conspiracy theories going back on that
*  to that 9 11 thing is that one of the reasons why this country is sort of turning in on one another
*  is because right now we don't have for the first time in forever because they were pulling out
*  troops of everywhere we don't have an enemy you know we don't have an actual targeted
*  let's unify to beat this opponent type of situation instead troops are coming home
*  for the first time in forever from afghanistan and this and that and we we realized that we were
*  we were we were fooled into getting into iraq and all of this other stuff it's all becoming
*  so clear and since we don't have an enemy we're starting to just a little bit of that for sure
*  yeah and then there's also covid in the lockdown which exacerbated everything because so many
*  people are stressed out and out of work there's some crazy number like 30 percent of the people
*  in this country can't pay rent right yeah that's never happened before it's in our lifetime it's
*  insane and how does that bounce back that's my my point about melrose like in a big city who's
*  going to invest in going back into those places you know when you see these closed down places to
*  bring them back up to start to imagine a time where you're going to drive down melrose and all
*  those stores are filled again and there's all hustle and bustle and traffic and and people
*  walking on the streets and not dangerous fucking gangsters everywhere like it seems weird now right
*  yeah and sometimes it picks up you know a nice warm saturday afternoon it's it looks sort of the
*  same out there sort of yeah 30 i know it's weird i'm trying to rationalize it in my head but it's
*  not the same it's not no i remember we did uh this thing for the comedy store where uh it was uh
*  whitney comings and bill burr and paul rodriguez and um andy letterman and jay leno and and me were
*  on a roof with mike binder and and uh we were it was the first time i've been in hollywood
*  in a long time and the first time i've been at the store in a long time and it was really emotional
*  and it was sad and i was sitting there hanging out and and you realize there's no one on sunset
*  no one and every now and then like lamborghinis would go racing down sunset like flying like you
*  would hear like going 90 miles an hour plus down sunset no cops i was like this is crazy like this
*  is so strange it's very surreal one of the last times i was at uh the comedy store i got pulled
*  over because my muffler was too loud the cop pulled you over i pulled me over so what's that
*  like that just seems like a scene out of a comedy movie cop walks up to you and then what does he
*  ask for the id no no he goes um i was pulling you over because your muffler is too loud i go
*  it's it's a factory muffler right like it's i have an m3 from 2005 it's a dinan and it comes
*  with the dinan muffler you know what an e46 is e46 m3 not really there's a sweet spot in the do
*  you know anything about bmw's used to have it would you have a five five series yeah beautiful
*  car yeah great car that year that you had was 2002 2004 something like same year as the e46
*  it's the a lot of people think it's the goldilocks zone of uh bmw's because it's before bmw became
*  this really cushy um like luxury car and was more of a driver-focused car and uh my the year that i
*  have is uh 2005 i actually got it from a guy who contacted jamie who we were talking about e46s
*  he's like i got one that only has 15 000 original miles it's a silver e43 it's beautiful it's like
*  a classic looking car um but it has a it's not that loud so this cop was just looking for shit
*  fuck with people by and if i was an just some asshole right or maybe a young black guy
*  i might be getting a ticket i might be in trouble like he just decided to pull me over for nothing
*  i wasn't speeding at all i just took a right out of the comedy store parking lot and all
*  sudden the lights were on like immediately i pulled over and he pulls over and i go uh what
*  did i do and he goes uh seems like you got an aftermarket uh muffler in your car i go hey me
*  i go how you doing and he goes hey what's up and i go i don't have an aftermarket muffler i go it's
*  a dinan this is the way it comes from the factory yeah and he goes well it seemed pretty loud he
*  goes will you rev it for me i go okay so i give it a little boom boom and he's like yeah that might
*  be too loud you might want to get that checked i go okay what do i do now and he's like nothing
*  you're all right i go okay he goes i'm not really trying to pull people over for this you know we're
*  looking for bad guys and drunk drivers i go i understand it's okay and i'm like all right that
*  was a that was a fame privilege moment right and a white privilege moment i was driving away from
*  that knowing like if i was just a a 25 year old kid white black whatever i was probably getting
*  a ticket for a loud muffler it wasn't even loud it was just a cop looking to fill he had like
*  you probably have like this is controversial because some cops say it's not true and i've
*  talked to cops to say it is true like they have a number of tickets that they have to write in a
*  week or a month or whatever and they get in trouble if they don't write enough shit and so this guy was
*  like well that doesn't seem that soft let me pull this dude over just no reason yeah just that was
*  it there was no i mean i was he was going left i was going right he did a u-turn pulled me over
*  it was instantaneous yeah i got off on a warning recently the guy just lied to me he's like i got
*  you doing what was it 45 in a 35 or no no it was you point out that you drive a corvette yeah
*  you probably were doing 45 yeah but i realized he didn't say 45 i knew i was doing 45 and a 35 he
*  said i was doing like 49 or something like that but i knew i wasn't because i've did literally this
*  model corvette has like three speedometers that you can't miss there's a digital giant digital one
*  there's one there and then there's one on the other side that shows you another speed um what
*  you have more than one speed almost positive i think you have a tac you fucking luddite
*  you didn't even know what you have oh my god what are you talking who cares i got the engine no
*  it's a tachometer it shows you how many revolutions per minute your engine's going
*  you fucking dummy i know what an rp is i don't call it a tac i'm not some cool car guy what are
*  you talking about it's standard this is what you have you have a speedometer and a tachometer
*  they're right next to each other on every single car that's a performance car you know what there
*  is there's a regular speedometer i'm almost positive this is a regular one and then a digital
*  one and then the digital one tells you right in the middle with big numbers right and then
*  over the digital one on top of the rpms there's also one that digitally shows you two digital
*  ones you don't know what the fuck yeah there it is wait oh yeah there's two
*  first of all that one you're looking at is a fucking tac on the left yeah yeah no on the left
*  is a speedometer that one in the middle is a tac that's a tac tachometer yeah and in the tachometer
*  then it has miles per hour in the center of the tac right so the tac will show you when you hit
*  red line if you're using your paddle shifters so most of the time a luddite like you i'm sure you
*  put it in drive like a fucking dork you don't even use those paddles do you who needs them oh how
*  dare you you know what it's like if you press the pedal all the way down and drive goes fast
*  yeah yeah yeah that's all you care about right yeah it's the best feeling in the world you don't
*  need a clutch i don't need any of it you don't need to shift have you shifted for yourself ever
*  yeah it's a grown man yeah it's a lot of fun when's the last time you did it in that car i don't know
*  no no no no no no i mean a real shift left foot clutch yeah i used to have right hand yeah i used
*  to have one what'd you have well i used to own a high end e-launtra oh yeah sporty powerful
*  that got me prepared for my corvette um but no when i rent cars and stuff sometimes on the road
*  i'll i'll get one but yeah they don't rent you a stick shift sure they do who are they who's renting
*  you a stick shift there's a lot of janky cities out there joe really yeah what do you like what
*  do you rent what's the last time you rented a stick shift i can't i don't i mean it's all a
*  blur just keep making shit up go ahead what do you mean you don't think rental cars have stick
*  shifts they do but you have to like really ask for it i feel like most of the time they drive
*  automatics like there's stickers that people put on cars that say uh anti-theft deterrent and it
*  just shows a manual transmission because most people just don't know how to drive a manual
*  i liked it i mean i and if then if the car was um manual i would have i would have done that it's
*  fun it's fun to have stuff to do i like it that's really what it is it's fun to have stuff to do
*  yeah they're on their way out manuals yeah unfortunately you know they used to have
*  manuals on motorcycles where it was an actual stick shift the really old ones yeah josh serlin
*  he's the uh owner of uh black bear brand they're a real cool clothing company they built me this
*  really dope leather jacket man it's really cool um he makes like really interesting handmade stuff
*  like clothing and and shit and he's into like craftsmanship and old stuff and he has a motorcycle
*  i think it's like if you go to his instagram black bear brand he drives this really old motorcycle
*  there's brad pitt doing it it's i think they call it a suicide shifter because you have to reach down
*  imagine brad pitt beautiful as he is no helmet just driving around see it in the upper right
*  hand corner that picture that's what it's like so you shift like uh a clutch like you press and
*  shift it by hand just go to black bear brand on instagram because he does it um he's got videos
*  of him driving through tunnels it looks so badass and he said like i talked to him about it and he
*  was like it's the most alive i ever feel he goes the tank only lasts for like 20 miles like it's
*  this little ass tank and this engine just eats gas it's so inefficient because it's a really old
*  bike but he's just and shifting with one arm on the handlebar and shifting like this but there's
*  something about there he is look at this that's josh so he's driving this thing and then when he
*  shifts see that thing over by his uh dick that's his shifter look at that see he has to reach down
*  to shift gears weird right yeah how could they make a motorcycle more dangerous first time i
*  ever saw that was a drug dealer in phoenix i met this drug dealer when we were at uh the uh improv
*  tempi yeah that sounds about right yeah and he's like he may come hang out with us i was like hmm
*  oh cut to you holding on him in the back of his motorcycle my hands right as crazy shifter you
*  got there i didn't i avoided him yeah because he just seemed like trouble he was a little too
*  enthusiastic about hanging a little coke cocaine enthusiastic yeah that tempi improv is uh wow
*  yeah well tempi is college town yeah and it's surrounded by like that scotsdale area which is
*  notoriously um it's a upper town but that's the place where i think tyson got arrested there for
*  coke it's a a lot of coke like i didn't you know i'm ignorant coke i've never done it me too never
*  not once but i was with red band who's done it a lot and red band and i were in a club and he goes
*  you know everyone's on coke i go what he goes look around everyone's talking real loud to each other
*  and they're all touching their nose and it was almost like i couldn't unsee it anymore i was
*  like oh my god he's like dude everyone's on coke here yeah i go wow really he goes yeah they're all
*  on coke yeah makes sense though yeah like that scotsdale area a lot of rich folk a lot of people
*  like to party yeah i like hanging out with those people because i don't get tired until four five
*  six a.m normally in old normal life so i sometimes i i just i'm completely oblivious to it and i don't
*  realize that they're doing that and they don't want me to know that they're doing it so they keep it
*  secret from me and everybody wins we're all having fun have you ever had a desire to try it
*  see what the fuss is all about no there's nothing really with uh with anything that's an upper that
*  excites me one time i took a half of one of the pain pills that uh my dentist gave me when i had
*  a wisdom tooth removed and i immediately uh half and he told me to take two or something crazy he's
*  like take two of these if you feel any pain i took a half of one and i could see how people
*  would love to do heroin and all of it i could immediately the the warm sweaty feeling of
*  pure happiness went over me and i was smiling ear to ear just so happy and uh so that's a scary one
*  and that that was done i remember one time i uh got a hold of the old school nyquil
*  this is like in the 90s i was sick and i got a hold of old school nyquil and i took it and i was
*  lying in bed and i just like i was like melted into my pillow like ah yeah felt so good yeah
*  feels so good just drift away just be comforted i feel like you're in the womb yeah like everything's
*  gonna be okay tony everything's gonna be okay you're gonna get a big warm hug by the world
*  that's it that's exactly how i felt that day with the argument for people that don't have anything
*  going on in their life like why should i not do that right you know right luckily i had already
*  started the adventure of doing stand-up and all that and had a reputation or whatever because
*  i could totally 100 percent see myself it made me feel so good yeah well i think a lot of people
*  if you don't have a good enough like a discipline a thing you're into that requires work that you
*  really get joy out of if you don't have that and then you find the the drug early before you've
*  had the good feeling of accomplishment right that drug feeling could take you over and then it's
*  really hard to like sacrifice it's really hard to to embrace discomfort when you're really into
*  that codeine feeling there yeah just drift away all your worries go away tony yeah that's the big
*  problem with people with opioid addictions you know if you don't have something better than that
*  a lot of people are like why should i abandon it right you know and it's a it's a tough argument
*  because what's your argument for that what do you say hey you should suffer in a factory
*  you should you should work your way up to a mediocre existence of debt and and struggle
*  and hate your job every day and stay clean yeah that's rough what do you do what do you tell them
*  that's the that's the number one problem i think people have when they don't have a lot going for
*  them and they also get into drugs like how do we how do you fix that what do you think about
*  mushrooms being legal now in oregon dude steroids are illegal in oregon whoa legal rather everything's
*  legal well that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go to oregon get fucking buff just get jacked
*  trip my balls off become like dorian yates do acid who's dorian yates how dare you oh no how dare you
*  dorian yates one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time you know who lee haini is no son of a
*  bitch but does ronnie colman does he use a tach speedometer no i know ron colman columbus ohio
*  the ohio state university okay clearly yeah uh ronnie colman ohio ronnie colman was uh
*  you're thinking of mark colman i am thinking of mark son of a bitch that's a white guy
*  right ronnie colman's like one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time he was so big he doesn't
*  even seem real look at ronnie colman he's his son get out of here yeah he um he did the podcast
*  recently and his look how big he was dude he was so big now that guy i could picture throwing an
*  ice pick in one of one of his biceps oh yeah he wouldn't even notice it yeah um he he's had
*  every single disc in his back fused except like one or two i think is it a bunch of back surgeries
*  his back is all fucked up from just lifting in immense amounts of weight and pushing himself
*  like to be that big and that strong like you have to have a crazy work ethic look at his back go to
*  that upper right hand corner picture look at that what the fuck that's alien god that's so crazy
*  look at his butt cheeks jesus jesus jesus yeah so that's what you could look like if you moved to
*  oregon start lifting there's dorian look at dorian dorian's also been on the podcast he's
*  a normal-sized guy now but back then when he was the champ go to that one in the middle right there
*  bam look at that fucking come on son that's the size of him that's what i look like after lifting
*  uh 25 pound kettlebells a few times in my head look at the size of him he was uh for his day like
*  extraordinarily massive and that was like he sort of was one of the group of the next level of
*  bodybuilders that took mass to a new level and he when he you know when he talked about it on the
*  podcast he said he basically lived like a monk like all he did is eat and train like he was just
*  obsessed with being the best is it just a life of pain tearing your muscles so that they build
*  grow back bigger again and again and again that's a lot of it but it was just the results he was
*  addicted to standing on that stage going bam and everybody boy holy shit he wanted to just
*  unveil that's it's like people have a narrow minded perspective of what art is you know and
*  i think bodybuilding is an art but i think it's an art that only people who participate in it
*  truly appreciate i think there's a lot of arts like that i think pool's an art like that like
*  when i watch a guy like like i was saying effron reyes when i watch him play like you watch that
*  guy play like wow like the way he gets out it's like it's beautiful but only people really
*  understand pool know how difficult the shots are or how he changed the angle with english and
*  and i think bodybuilding when you see a guy like dorian yates or like lee haini or like
*  ronnie colman when they get to that peak form when they're on that stage like only a person who really
*  knows how difficult it is to be that massive and that shredded and to be standing there with
*  veins on your feet all the way up to your calves and your thighs and your fucking all the way up
*  to your neck and your head like that's massive crazy dedication it's steroids and dehydration
*  and there's so much involved in reaching that peak form when you get on stage like they're really
*  unhealthy when they get on stage like that moment when they're shredded they're super dehydrated
*  yeah they cut all the water yeah yikes it's a big yikes it's a crazy way to live yeah but for them
*  because they understand the dedication involved like people that are really into that man that's
*  like a tight-knit community of people that are really into like looking shredded and vascular and
*  what it means to be that guy you know yeah to be mr olympia as you could tell by my body not really
*  my thing well but your thing is killing killing on stage like i was talking to uh well i've talked to
*  a bunch of comics about this but i think recently i was talking to sagura about it we're like can
*  you imagine living your whole life and never killing never knowing what it's like to just
*  to just crush thank you good night you know to lay down a netflix special you know and have people

*  had it once cornrows yeah i need to see that picture uh do i have a picture of it i'll give
*  you a raise if you get cornrows that high contact that glance he just gave you do it on the show or
*  what i just will you get in trouble if you wear cornrows will that be cultural appropriation of
*  the have they let that go probable i would imagine so yeah it's for white girls it's a real issue
*  but for a guy it might be a goof i would it hurt oh i would imagine it's very tight uriah
*  faber got that when he fought because you're uriah the california kid he's got some long hair
*  yeah we get some cornrows you could do it during a show you could just have one of the cornrow
*  people behind him doing it with the pig and the whole deal i did it for sure it's when i was still
*  in a band i had long hair back then i forgot you were in a band yeah wait do you have any recordings
*  pierce pierce yes well we're gonna end this show absolutely not yeah we have to no no no no it's
*  not good no that's why it's good come on let me make fun of you is it on youtube no there was
*  no youtube this is it was a long time ago i think it's on youtube saving yeah it's not it's not we
*  should put it on youtube we should put it on the jre channel probably not do you have it you
*  wouldn't even know i'm in the band those i'm not singing i'm not you know what are you playing
*  playing bass and guitar in the band so like there's a bunch of other people that they probably
*  wouldn't be big fans of that being out there either have you thought about bringing that back
*  now that we're in the center of live entertainment this is the place i have i have have you really
*  thought about coming back yeah really really people last night were trying to book me a
*  gig already i was like calm down oh my goodness what was the name of your band
*  please welcome eat shit thank you so much we're each shit good night
*  right
*  what kind of music uh it was like heavy metal rock music you know dude you're playing metal
*  uh-huh wow i mean that's how i turned i i have a ear for music like i turned you on to that
*  fucking badass song by uh aaron jones yes dude he's really good i've got into a bunch of his
*  shit his people reached out let's see he's gonna send us the album he said but it's not done yet
*  he's very good he's uh he's very good and very unique seattle sound i think is what they're
*  calling it that's a lot how much good music came out of seattle and that is a crazy part of the
*  world a lot of despair and rainy days that's it yeah motherfuckers get it go inside like how
*  much good music comes out of miami right and by the way you know seattle has one more day of rain
*  if it's good per year than cleveland and cleveland has one averages one more day of clouds than seattle
*  so they have an equal amount of shitty days and a lot of great shit comes from cleveland yep it's
*  where the rock and roll hall of fame is so if you think about it suzanne santo from honey honey
*  yeah yep honey honey came out of uh a lot of people come out of cleveland yeah those places
*  that really suck those people have a lot of pride it's weird oh yeah people like live in places that
*  are awesome they don't give a fuck about those spots but people that like fucking hang in there
*  in pittsburgh we're gonna fucking hang in here pittsburgh or death you know there was a dude
*  who came to my cleveland show with a t-shirt on i said cleveland or death and uh i put him on my
*  instagram i was like that shirt needs to be seen that was what it said right that makes sense i'm
*  sure something like that yeah i picked death on that one but you're from youngstown i know people
*  from youngstown dream of moving to cleveland yeah no i know i'm kidding uh but yeah you know being
*  from those places is great but getting out of them and getting out of there is better it only works
*  if you get out well this is fucking winters man yeah that's what i'm talking with joey diaz about
*  it's joe rogan this fucking winter is gonna be a cold one i could feel it i go there's always a
*  place for you in texas yeah he's dreading winter like a fucking game of thrones character right now
*  we're playing games we're playing games i'm eventually gonna get him out here it's just
*  gonna take some time i saw white walker the other day joe they're coming let me know when you open
*  up that club when i open up that club he'll be there day one the flood gates will open i'm gonna
*  put out the bat signal yeah because i don't think the comedy store is gonna open up and i
*  don't think the clubs in new york are gonna open up i think it's gonna be a while but we have rapid
*  testing here i mean we do it at the studio i think if i hired this is my thought if we have a parking
*  lot and in that parking lot you have a team of 10 nurses and you tell everybody to come an hour
*  before the show the show's at eight get here by seven you get tested you just have a name you you
*  everybody wears a mask you get it's a quick nose swab it's not hard you do a quick test everybody
*  goes inside when you're when you're clear and when you're not clear they get you the fuck out of
*  there yeah but i bet most people would be clear yeah and you maybe catch a few here there that
*  didn't know they'd have it right if you have it if you think you don't feel good please don't come
*  or get tested at this resource and come on down and then you have people they get tested they go
*  inside and then they can have a drink and wait for the show to start show starts at eight or
*  eight thirty give people plenty of time yeah that's not unreasonable to ask not at all people
*  before the doors open up at the store people wait in line for longer than 15 minutes right yeah so
*  if you could have 10 nurses i mean you've you got your test today it literally takes five seconds to
*  administer the test well 10 seconds right it's 10 seconds of swabbing your nose so they swab your
*  nose they do the test it takes 15 minutes to get the results but you could do that if you have a
*  name and a number like uh number 79 that's me you're clear all right good you got your ticket maybe
*  you have a qr code or something like that they scan it at the door it's not hard to imagine that
*  you could do a real show out here like a real show like 300 people packed like in a place the
*  size of the comedy store main room 350 400 people you could do that here yeah it's not
*  like because there's a disease doesn't mean there's not a workaround where everybody can
*  still be safe and still be like we're doing right now everyone in this room has been tested we're
*  okay so then we can just sit across from each other and have fun and not even think about it
*  right that could be done in a comedy club it can be done you know and is it easy to do right now
*  no it's a little complicated it's a little expensive but is it better than not doing it
*  yeah especially if you're a fan of comedy if you know that you can just get tested then you can
*  go perform in front of a real crowd like packed like the old days where everybody's clean yeah
*  god we were having so much fun we were having too much fun but this is the wake-up call it's a
*  little reminder that you and i and diaz and ari and duncan and and so many others we live through
*  the golden years of the comedy store it was the golden years and almost like poetically it ended
*  at the peak it was sold out every night yeah every night monday tuesday wednesday thursday
*  multiple shows a night main room or i remember going in there on a tuesday night there was two
*  shows sold out in the main room the show in the or was completely they were doing two shows in
*  the or remember that yeah they started doing an early show and a late show because there were so
*  many people yeah you had to rotate the crowd belly room was packed packed yeah everything was packed
*  those were always two or three shows a night in the belly yeah and people were flying in from all
*  around the world it was literally the golden age of comedy and then it ended and now tell me what
*  you were telling me about la how fucked up they are they won't even let people you're doing a show
*  with no audience in the main room streaming it to people in the parking lot and they won't let you
*  do it right they gave uh they gave the comedy store a ticket because we were streaming the show
*  from inside to outside on televisions but but you can also stream other things you can play the
*  lakers you can play ufc you could show anything you want that's live you just can't show what's
*  happening inside the building live outside to the parking lot so how does that make any sense right
*  it doesn't it's ridiculous and by the way the system's so messed up that one week it'll be one
*  person and the next week a different person says that that's okay but this isn't allowed and
*  and uh performing in a window is okay but streaming it to screens isn't or it changes
*  continuously because there is no consistency and they don't know what to do and then at one point
*  it got approved by uh west hollywood that they were allowed to do certain things shows yeah in
*  the parking lot yeah they sent out a newsletter yep i was like oh shit they're gonna do shows in
*  the parking lot yep and then the city of la shut it down yep la county was like nope even though
*  you're your own thing west hollywood were not allowing you to do that what do you think that's
*  political it's it's it's all a mess man i just i i how does that make sense if you can go eat
*  at boa and that's outside right how does that make sense right and also when you factor in
*  that people will be talking less than they would be especially you know right around the corners
*  the saddle ranch which is playing music and you have people at tables talking over the music to
*  one another so if it's about protecting people from a disease and then you factor in that almost
*  nobody talks during a comedy show other than the one person talking and that they're all facing
*  one direction and clearly if there were scientists they'd be like oh it's much easier to spread it
*  with the music and that that's totally legal then with that we're almost nobody's talking
*  and then the comedy store was also proposing a big shield a plexiglass shield between the audience
*  and this in the stand though yeah and they're still like nope right because it's live entertainment
*  and they think that if they do that people are going to just start dancing or something making
*  out i don't know what's going on doesn't make any sense what i talked to dave smith about yesterday
*  we're like these governors and these mayors they all suddenly have power it's very difficult to
*  let that power go it's not it's not nice and they keep getting paid what should happen is
*  their income should be based entirely on the income of the city or the state so when the income
*  the city and the state is drastically reduced the salary of the governor and the salary of the mayor
*  should be radically reduced as well it's brilliant and then you would see how quickly these
*  motherfuckers would open things up yeah 100 and on that note fuck faces that's it that's it
*  um where you at tonight well people will find out tomorrow yeah but i'm at uh i'm at uh vulcan
