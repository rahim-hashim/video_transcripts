# Joe Rogan Experience #1928 - Jimmy Corsetti & Ben van Kerkwyk
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6.0s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=13.0s)]
*  Hi Joe, how you doing? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=15.0s)]
*  Good to see you again. Ben, nice to meet you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=16.0s)]
*  It's a pleasure to meet you as well, Joe. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=17.0s)]
*  I've enjoyed your videos and I've enjoyed your videos, of course. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=19.0s)]
*  Jimmy, I watched your whole series on Atlanta all day today. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=22.0s)]
*  I've been watching for hours. I've been watching impact videos, videos about the Atlanta structure. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=27.0s)]
*  And so let's just get into it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=35.0s)]
*  Let's do it. So the Rishat structure, I was on your show a little over a year ago and shared some details about it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=37.0s)]
*  To people who aren't aware, there's a location in the western Sahara desert of Mauritania called the Rishat structure. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=43.0s)]
*  It's also commonly referred to as the Eye of the Sahara. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=49.0s)]
*  It is a site that most people have never seen or heard of before, which is truly peculiar because it's so spectacular. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=53.0s)]
*  It's a site that astronauts typically use to reference from space. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=61.0s)]
*  It is a geological feature that is said to be volcanic in nature. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=65.0s)]
*  And what's so spectacular about this is that it just so happens to match more than a dozen striking similarities to what Plato had described as the lost ancient capital city of Atlantis. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=69.0s)]
*  I almost feel like we're not going to do your video justice by just talking about it because the video is so good and you go into so many details. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=81.0s)]
*  By the end of it, my jaw was dropped. I was like, holy shit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=90.0s)]
*  Like from what you had the last time you were on the podcast to what you put out now, it's even more compelling. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=93.0s)]
*  Way more compelling. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=101.0s)]
*  I appreciate you saying that. And I guess to anyone that wants to check it out, I have a YouTube channel called Bright Insight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=103.0s)]
*  It's right at the top of the page and it says lost ancient Roman map has Atlantis and Sahara Africa. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=108.0s)]
*  And that's kind of where it goes from there is that there is a actually let me just mention real quick. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=115.0s)]
*  Like you're a very inquisitive individual. You have many interesting people that come and chat with you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=120.0s)]
*  And when I had asked you last time, you said that until you had saw my video, you'd never seen or heard of the structure. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah. Anytime I meet somebody new or from at some party like, oh, what do you do? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=130.0s)]
*  We start chatting about YouTube. The first thing I do now is I show him a picture of the wrist shot. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=135.0s)]
*  And I've never not once ever come across one single person that has seen or heard of it before other than people who are familiar with what I've shared. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=138.0s)]
*  But there's so many things like the where the water flows to the south, where there's clear evidence of water erosion that took place after the volcano. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=146.0s)]
*  There's so much that points to that possibly being Atlantis. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=158.0s)]
*  It's spectacular. So just to run down real quick, Plato had described Atlantis as being the capital. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=163.0s)]
*  Let me just mention that because it was an empire said to be made up of ten kingdoms. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=168.0s)]
*  And what I'm focusing on is the lost capital city, which was said to be made up of concentric circles, three of water, two of land, which matches the wrist shot structure. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=171.0s)]
*  It also was said to have an opening to the sea at the south. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=180.0s)]
*  And if you look at it from satellite imagery, you can clearly see that water had ran through it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=183.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. Tell Jamie what image to pull up so we can. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=187.0s)]
*  And furthermore, it was said to have mountains to the north. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=190.0s)]
*  And you just so happen to have mountains called the Atlas Mountain Chain, which Atlas was said to be the very first king of Atlantis. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=196.0s)]
*  And what's interesting is that the very first known king of Mauritania, which is where the wrist shot structure is located, is also their very first known king was also named Atlas. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=203.0s)]
*  And though I'm not saying that that's the same individual, but what we do today is we pass down names, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=212.0s)]
*  Like people like, oh, my dad's name is John, and so is my son. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=218.0s)]
*  And so it's another striking similarity. But it goes further than that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=222.0s)]
*  Like there's geological similarities, such as the fact that Atlantis was said to be made up of red, black and white color stone, which is another similarity you see at the wrist shot structure. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=225.0s)]
*  It was said to have an abundance of gold and that the outer walls were lined with it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=234.0s)]
*  And it turns out that Mauritania is loaded with gold. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=238.0s)]
*  And not only that, the richest person ever known to exist in all of mankind is Mansa Musa of the Mali Empire, which consisted partly of modern day Mauritania. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=241.0s)]
*  And he was so rich from gold that he would be richer than Elon Musk and like Bezos combined almost like many unfathomable amount of billions of dollars. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=251.0s)]
*  So that's another similarity. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=260.0s)]
*  What year was this? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=262.0s)]
*  Oh, this is 1300s or 1400s. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=263.0s)]
*  There he is. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=266.0s)]
*  Yeah, there we are. 1312, 1337. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=267.0s)]
*  What a great name too. Mansa Musa. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=269.0s)]
*  But the similarities don't end there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=271.0s)]
*  There was said to be an abundance of elephants, which is one reason why to suggest that Atlantis would have been in Africa is because besides the fact that elephants are known to be in throughout Africa, they used to be in Mauritania. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=273.0s)]
*  They're unfortunately pretty much extinct there today. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=284.0s)]
*  But another little detail that most people aren't aware of because they think of Atlantis like, oh, it must be at the bottom of the ocean. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=287.0s)]
*  Well, that's not exactly how Plato worded it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=294.0s)]
*  He did describe that the aftermath of Atlantis followed a catastrophic event involving water is that what was left of Atlantis was reeds of grass and a shoal of mud that prevented ships from navigating to and from. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=297.0s)]
*  And what people don't realize is that Sahara Africa up until about 4500 to 5000 years ago was totally green. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=311.0s)]
*  It was tropical. It had the largest network or one of the largest networks of rivers ever known to exist. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=319.0s)]
*  It had the largest freshwater lake ever known to exist, which is mega Lake Chad, which just to put this into perspective, it is if you take all the North American Great Lakes combined, that's 94000 square miles of surface area, whereas mega Lake Chad was 139000. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=324.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=341.0s)]
*  Massive. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=342.0s)]
*  The additionally Atlantis, the capital was said to have a river that went just north of it or next to it in the Tom and Ross at River went right through the Rishat structure or just north of it went all the way to the Atlas Mountains that I described, which is in modern day Morocco. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=344.0s)]
*  And the evidence is that it existed at that same period of time when Atlantis was said to be around 11600 years ago prior to its destruction up until about 5000 years ago. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=361.0s)]
*  So going back to my point, like a lot of people see the Sahara Desert, and they don't realize that this place was unbelievably different than it is today. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=372.0s)]
*  And one of the things that's so important is that I know some people listening will hear Atlantis, they think, oh, it didn't exist. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=380.0s)]
*  Right. Whether it existed or not, the the evidence that we're going to chat about today to show you that there is conclusive evidence, I would say that catastrophic water erosion that the ocean had blasted through the Sahara. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=386.0s)]
*  Tens of millions of years more recently than previously known, according to the science, 56 to 66 million years ago was the time of the Trans-Saharan Seaway, which was the last time the ocean blasted through it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=399.0s)]
*  However, there are a few lines of evidence that say otherwise. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=410.0s)]
*  Besides the fact that anyone that looks at the Sahara Desert on through the Google Earth app, you can see fluvial striations, which is signature traits of water erosion. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=414.0s)]
*  This is confirmed by other experts that look into these things as far as I like to mention Randall Carlson. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=424.0s)]
*  He's someone that's analyzed the area and has said, yes, this is catastrophic water erosion. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=430.0s)]
*  But so one of the signature lines of evidence that suggests that the ocean blasted through it far more recently was the largest volcano in Sahara Africa is in Chad. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=435.0s)]
*  It's Mount Kusi and there is a lava flow that goes through it that is dated at 12,000 or so years ago. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=447.0s)]
*  The volcano itself is supposed to be somewhere between 1.2 and 2.3 million years ago. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=455.0s)]
*  But if you look at Mount Kusi to the south, you can see and I don't know, Jamie, if you're able to bring up one of the photos of of that mountain chain, but you can see that the water erosion cuts off that lava flow directly to the south. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=460.0s)]
*  Yeah, keep going over a little bit right there. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=473.0s)]
*  OK, so go over a couple of that is the mountain and you can see those striations, which are signature traits of water erosion. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=476.0s)]
*  All those white blemishes are salt. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=483.0s)]
*  And I should point out real quick that it is a confirmed fact that much of the Sahara has surface level salt. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=485.0s)]
*  And you see those white blemishes on that mountain that is not clouds. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=490.0s)]
*  That is not snow. Those are salt deposits and surface level salt that would have been from the ocean. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=493.0s)]
*  That is what I that is what I suggest, because in the middle of that caldera, you have huge patches of salt. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=500.0s)]
*  And is it reasonable to suggest that that salt existed before that the creation of that volcano? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=505.0s)]
*  Because it seems to me that all that molten that salt would burn up. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=511.0s)]
*  And not only that, there is scientific studies that show that there are gastropods, which are sea life, that existed inside that caldera that used to be a thousand feet deep and dried up just a few thousand years ago. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=514.0s)]
*  So the fact that this is an 11000 foot volcano that has salt on top of it, I would say is corresponding evidence that the ocean had once went through it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=526.0s)]
*  And if you go over a couple more images, Jamie, you will see far better images that show you that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=535.0s)]
*  OK, so notice how it cuts off. You see to the black right here that that is a lava flow that's dated around 12000 or so years ago. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=542.0s)]
*  And regardless of whether the volcano or that water erosion happened 12000 years ago or two million years ago, that in itself is evidence that the ocean blasted through the Sahara Desert literally 50 to 60 million years more recently than previously known. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=550.0s)]
*  And the implications of this as far as climate science, as far as the topic of geology and cataclysms cannot be overstated. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=566.0s)]
*  I mean, does it not look like that that water, excuse me, that lava flow was cut off by whatever type of erosion that is? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=574.0s)]
*  Does it? I mean, that's yeah, completely. Yeah, it's it's such a clean line and it aligns with all the water erosion marks that are to the left of it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=581.0s)]
*  Can you make that smaller, Jamie? Can you make it stretch it out? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=589.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I'll start. Go ahead. Nothing. It's just like you could really clearly see that it looks like a line, like a water line pass through what was marked by the volcanic eruption. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=596.0s)]
*  And this is one thing I say. I'm like, it's it's visible to anyone that has eyes to see. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=609.0s)]
*  But it turns out that the Sahara Desert is one of the least studied places on Earth, mostly because it's so inhospitable. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=613.0s)]
*  It's an average of one hundred and twenty five degrees Fahrenheit much of the year. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=620.0s)]
*  It is so unbelievably big that just to get out there, I mean, you need reliable aircraft or vehicles. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=623.0s)]
*  There is most of the countries out there are, I regret to say, third world in that you just don't have supplies. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=629.0s)]
*  It's not feasible to just travel out there with a whole team at on a whim. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=635.0s)]
*  So most of it is essentially undocumented. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=639.0s)]
*  And it's not a site, the Sahara as a whole isn't a site that gets much attention. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=642.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, Ben, we got to bring you in. Otherwise, it's going to talk forever. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=645.0s)]
*  I was going to say something that that you mentioned about the origin of, I guess, the Plato's description. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=648.0s)]
*  You said it was mud and grasses was like the aftermath. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=654.0s)]
*  It's interesting. It's the topic I've been exploring recently is that that does match some of the translations of origin stories from the ancient Egyptians. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=657.0s)]
*  So it's like that the Temple of Horus at Edfu, it's this amazing structure, but it's literally covered head to toe in hieroglyphs and descriptions and all these types of things. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=665.0s)]
*  But one of the stories in the translations they do talk about is this what they would call the the original point or the primordial mound, the primordial island. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=674.0s)]
*  They describe it as being an island that was surrounded by water that was sinking. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=683.0s)]
*  And essentially these reeds that were growing on it that created a falcon's perch. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=687.0s)]
*  And then the god, it was either Horus or Horun, one of the falcon gods, alights on this perch and then gains divinity. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=691.0s)]
*  But as part of that story, I mean, they they and then he goes and forms Kemet, the essentially the god of the gods. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=697.0s)]
*  Kemet, the essentially the motherland Egypt. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=703.0s)]
*  And it's this tale of them, I guess, their civilization moving and migrating to this new land. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=706.0s)]
*  But they they do talk about a whole stack of unknown gods and a whole culture that existed before that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=712.0s)]
*  It's an interesting correlation. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=719.0s)]
*  It's something that Graham Hancock speculated about in his work with the Temple of Horus at Edfu. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=721.0s)]
*  You know, they they also have, you know, catastrophic flood myths and things like this. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=726.0s)]
*  But it it may be that whatever prior civilization and that's might have been where the dynastic Egyptians actually got their origins from, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=730.0s)]
*  because it seems clear that they've inherited some things from the past. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=738.0s)]
*  That's a story they themselves tell. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=741.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't aware that the story of Atlantis had come from Egypt. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=743.0s)]
*  That's one of the most bizarre parts about it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=747.0s)]
*  I didn't know this until just a few years ago, either. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=749.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, wait a second. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=751.0s)]
*  Plato didn't just Plato, his his distant relative, Solon, had traveled there in search of knowledge because Egypt was the place to go for it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=752.0s)]
*  And yeah, it was it was the priests of the delta that told Solon. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=759.0s)]
*  And he said they said that, yes, so six thousand years or nine thousand years prior to the time of Solon was when the sinking of this city happened. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=763.0s)]
*  And that that works out to be nine thousand six hundred B.C. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=772.0s)]
*  So eleven thousand six hundred years ago, which is bang on exactly where now the geological evidence points to basically the end of the Younger Dryas cataclysm like something. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=776.0s)]
*  We know something happened at the start at like twelve thousand eight hundred nine hundred years and then eleven thousand six hundred years ago was that end of the Younger Dryas that brought us up out of the cold spell and into the Holocene. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=783.0s)]
*  Isn't it crazy that that's a full thousand years and we think about it in like the same time period like, yeah, I mean, around that time. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=793.0s)]
*  We're literally eleven thousand six hundred twelve thousand eight hundred. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=801.0s)]
*  We're literally talking about a thousand fucking years. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=804.0s)]
*  It's so much time. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=807.0s)]
*  It's so much time that actually if you go from twelve thousand eight. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=808.0s)]
*  So basically, let's say twelve hundred years. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=811.0s)]
*  The English language, Old English, is only like fourteen hundred years and Modern English is only like four or five hundred years. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=813.0s)]
*  So this is such a wide, a long period of time that we weren't even speaking the same language that in that same, you know, thousand years ago. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=819.0s)]
*  It's a you think of it like that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=827.0s)]
*  It's like it's not a different world. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=828.0s)]
*  It's nuts. And if you think about the people that lived a thousand years ago and how they lived, you know, all of this that I've learned from Graham Hancock and from Randall Carlson and from you guys, all of it is so astonishing. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=830.0s)]
*  And it all fits into place. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=845.0s)]
*  It all makes sense. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=847.0s)]
*  Like, why are we so fucked up? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=848.0s)]
*  Like, why is civilization so wacky? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=850.0s)]
*  Why do we have these these these weird structures that no one can really explain? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=853.0s)]
*  And when you think about the fact that there's so much evidence that we were hit by comets, that we were hit by large objects like I didn't know about that enormous crater that's in Antarctica. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=858.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=872.0s)]
*  Tell I don't know all the details on how old that one's supposed to be, but it's one of the largest, isn't it? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=873.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a big one in in in Antarctica. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=878.0s)]
*  I don't know that much about it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=881.0s)]
*  But another one that you have you heard of Burkle Crater? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=882.0s)]
*  That's another one. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=884.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=885.0s)]
*  Yeah, Burkle Crater, like the 20, 20 mile hole in the bottom of the Indian Ocean. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=886.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=889.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=890.0s)]
*  And when is that supposed to be? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=891.0s)]
*  So five. That was 5000 years ago. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=892.0s)]
*  They've dated that it's something plopped down in the Indian Ocean and it washed up these mega tsunamis on the coast of Madagascar in Western Australia that we can see in satellite images today. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=894.0s)]
*  He's got these like five, six hundred foot high chevrons from where the water went miles inland. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=904.0s)]
*  And they found organic material from the seabed in these chevrons. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=908.0s)]
*  And then they date that with carbon 14 dating and they put it right at 5000 years ago. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=913.0s)]
*  So 2500 around that time, B.C., which is actually a really interesting date when you consider some of the I guess the publications that we rely on in our in our modern civilization today. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=918.0s)]
*  The Bible, the Old Testament wasn't written long after that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=928.0s)]
*  And if you think about where the Indian Ocean is, that could have been the source of the biblical flood like that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=931.0s)]
*  That would have washed up north into the Persian Gulf, flooded the hell out of that whole region. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=936.0s)]
*  It's just crazy that it's happened so many times. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=940.0s)]
*  We like to think of history as being this linear thing. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=943.0s)]
*  We started out as cave people. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=946.0s)]
*  We branched out from Africa all across the world and kept and kept learning. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=948.0s)]
*  And here we are today with cell phones. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=953.0s)]
*  No, no, it's we've been we've been rocked like multiple times, many, many times. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=955.0s)]
*  And there's real solid evidence. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=960.0s)]
*  The Antarctica one. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=962.0s)]
*  How old do they think that is? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=963.0s)]
*  I don't recall on that. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=965.0s)]
*  I have to double check that I have to do a Google, Jamie. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=966.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=969.0s)]
*  So researchers have discovered a crater 1.5 kilometers beneath the Antarctica ice crust, 482 kilometers in diameter, 482 kilometers in diameter. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=970.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=980.0s)]
*  What does that probably dates back to a meteorite impact 250 million years ago? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=982.0s)]
*  That's wow. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=987.0s)]
*  OK, so that's an old one. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=988.0s)]
*  It's like an order of magnitude bigger than anything related even with the younger draw. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=989.0s)]
*  I mean, that's bigger than the dinosaur one. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=993.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's like a 99 point whatever percent extinction event. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=995.0s)]
*  So it just keeps happening. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=999.0s)]
*  The earth just over millions and millions of years and thousands of years that humans have been around. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1001.0s)]
*  The earth just keeps getting whacked. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1005.0s)]
*  The evidence is so overwhelming in it and say going back to the younger, driest period of time, there's evidence. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1008.0s)]
*  When you say get whacked, more than 30 percent of all landmass at that time was charred, burned. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1013.0s)]
*  They claim that it's more fires than existed in the time of the dinosaurs. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1019.0s)]
*  Now, I don't know if that's an article I read on Science Alert. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1022.0s)]
*  I don't know if they can truly prove that. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1025.0s)]
*  But if nothing else, 30 percent of all landmass existing today was burned and scorched to death at that period of time. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1027.0s)]
*  That like helps people to wrap their heads around like this. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1033.0s)]
*  The world was on fire. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1036.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the younger, driest map. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1037.0s)]
*  They estimate as part of the burning and because there was floods and fire and this correlates to a lot of origin myths from cultures all around the world. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1039.0s)]
*  But yeah, 10 percent of the biomass, I think, is the 9 to 10 percent of the, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1047.0s)]
*  which is an inconceivable number of that's how much of the world was was burnt and that's now embedded in this black mass. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1051.0s)]
*  10 percent of the biomass. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1058.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1059.0s)]
*  It's so crazy that there's like literally a dark line. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1060.0s)]
*  Yeah, in the ground. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1063.0s)]
*  In the ground. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1064.0s)]
*  It shows where everything was on fire for a long fucking time. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1065.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1068.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1069.0s)]
*  We barely survived it. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1070.0s)]
*  There's actually we now have a correlation of not only population reduction, but a significant drop in like genetic diversity as a result. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1071.0s)]
*  Like it's tied to the younger dry. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1081.0s)]
*  There's been a few good studies recently done at that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1082.0s)]
*  So we were one of the megafauna that the 50 percent of megafauna at the time that actually survived and got through that event. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1084.0s)]
*  How do they think people survived? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1091.0s)]
*  Is there any speculation? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1092.0s)]
*  And where did we survive? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1094.0s)]
*  Like where was the good spot? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1096.0s)]
*  I think caves. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1098.0s)]
*  I think a lot of it would have been underground. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1099.0s)]
*  And I think that's you might actually they may have even known. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1101.0s)]
*  I think there's some evidence to suggest that some of these like Derinkuyu in Turkey, in the Cappadocia region, region could host tens of thousands of people. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1104.0s)]
*  There's massive labyrinths all over Egypt beneath Saqqara. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1113.0s)]
*  There's miles and miles of tunnels and catacombs. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1116.0s)]
*  I've been down into a bunch of them. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1118.0s)]
*  And even when you look at sites like Gobekli Tepe, there's been some interpretations of the artwork on that site that seems to indicate a cosmic calendar. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1120.0s)]
*  Like they're almost marking that date. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1129.0s)]
*  We know that the ancients were watching the sky like they were concerned about it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1131.0s)]
*  And comet mythology is a fantastic topic for Randall. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1135.0s)]
*  I talked with him about this quite a bit. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1138.0s)]
*  The comet it wasn't seen as a pretty thing in the sky. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1140.0s)]
*  Like it was the harbinger of doom. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1142.0s)]
*  Like comets and all those types of things were just seen as really bad things that they were preparing for. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1144.0s)]
*  But I think we survived partly because of diversity and being spread out all around the world. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1150.0s)]
*  There were parts of the world that weren't as badly touched like Australia, for example. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1155.0s)]
*  That whole continent wasn't as badly affected as, say, the northern hemisphere was from the younger dryas. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1159.0s)]
*  But also caves, 100 percent caves and sheltered caves. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1164.0s)]
*  Those big cities that they could take tens of thousands of people on the ground. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1168.0s)]
*  Yeah. Something wild that has popped back up in my head. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1172.0s)]
*  Speaking of flooding and this 11,000 year time frame, going back to the Rishat structure, there's a study that I came across that ties into the video that we were just mentioning. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1175.0s)]
*  That off the west coast of Sahara Africa, right in front of the Rishat structure, there is an underwater seafloor slide dated at approximately 11,000 years ago. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1183.0s)]
*  And keyword approximately, the very symbol is in there. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1193.0s)]
*  So they're not entirely sure the date, but in that time frame and this sediment looks like in the shape that was blasted from a flood of water coming out of the Sahara, just based on the nature of the shape of it. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1195.0s)]
*  That's more than 200 miles wide and maybe 130, 140, 150 miles from north to south. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1206.0s)]
*  And it's layered sentiment that is 2,000 meters, excuse me, more than a mile deep. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1212.0s)]
*  And it's layered this right here. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1219.0s)]
*  So one, it's corresponding evidence that massive force of water may have blown out of the Sahara. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1221.0s)]
*  And the one reason why this is so significant is besides the fact that it indicates a possible flood of 11,000 years ago. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1227.0s)]
*  But if there was any remnants of Atlantis, if there was, if the Rishat structure was the location, this is where you would want to go looking. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1233.0s)]
*  I mean, it's again layered sentiment, more sediment, excuse me, thank you, sentiment, more than a mile deep. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1241.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1250.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's just to put this in a perspective from going from east to west based on this 200 mile, the widest point of the Florida Peninsula is 150 miles. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1251.0s)]
*  Like this is more than 50 miles wider than the entire state of Florida panhandle. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1261.0s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, it's the same distance from New York City to where do I have that in D.C., excuse me. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1266.0s)]
*  So like this is literally evidence of a catastrophic flood. That's more than just a seafloor slide, something bulldozed. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1274.0s)]
*  And when you look at these fluvial erosions, anyone that's looking at this right now, signature traits of catastrophic water erosion. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1280.0s)]
*  And it looks exactly like they teach in school when it comes to water striations, whether it's from glaciers or from water. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1289.0s)]
*  These are signature traits of water. This is not wind. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1294.0s)]
*  And the fact that all these areas of white blemishes, say in the Rishat, are confirmed salt. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1297.0s)]
*  There's numerous studies. I mean, for example, there is a treaties from 1851 from England and Mauritania that list a few things that talks about one, that abundance of gold. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1302.0s)]
*  It lists that. But we'll actually move back up salt. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1314.0s)]
*  They used to export gold out of Mauritania to Europe, and that's one of the locations. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1317.0s)]
*  And also gold. It said that prior to the land or the gold rush of North America back in the 1800s, Europe got most of their gold supply from Mauritania as well, which is an interesting point, because if that was a site of Atlantis, which was said to be so rich in gold, what an interesting similarity. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1322.0s)]
*  Go back to that image again, please, Jamie. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1341.0s)]
*  What's really fascinating, too, is the description of Atlantis, of having that opening to the south, and then you see this clear pathway to the south. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1344.0s)]
*  Everything lines up, the shape of Atlantis, like the concentric circles, the amount of them, earth to water, the way the representation of it as described, the mountains to the north, like everything lines up. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1356.0s)]
*  And not only that, all that salt is all, if people play around with this on Google Earth, you can check the elevation by using your mouse. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1371.0s)]
*  All the areas with all the most significant amounts of salt happen to be at the lowest elevations, which I think is corresponding evidence that seawater had settled and later evaporated there. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1377.0s)]
*  And as you see here, you can see it rips through the entire Sahara. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1387.0s)]
*  And if you look at their study that's showing the Trans-Saharan Seaway of 56 to 66 million years ago, it shows that the water blasted to the south, but it does not show it going west over the Rishat. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1391.0s)]
*  So I feel like there was some other event, something separate that happened. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1403.0s)]
*  And, I mean, yeah, these photos are spectacular. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1408.0s)]
*  The photos are spectacular, but could you zoom out again, please, Jamie? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1410.0s)]
*  The thing that's crazy is how clearly it looks like water came over that and washed back. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1413.0s)]
*  Look at the left side of that image. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1419.0s)]
*  It looks so clearly like massive amounts of water came over there and then pulled back. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1422.0s)]
*  Like, look at the way it's eroded. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1429.0s)]
*  Do you want something that's going to blow your mind? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1431.0s)]
*  So this area right here, scroll in, Jamie, and you'll see we discussed this last time as being water ripples. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1433.0s)]
*  So remember when Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson were on your show a few years ago and they were showing you the area of the Missoula floodplains in Montana and Washington? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1439.0s)]
*  Westpaw. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1449.0s)]
*  God, look, it's so clear. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1450.0s)]
*  And so what's interesting is that, so I measured these and there might be some of the slides in there. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1452.0s)]
*  I'm not totally sure, but yeah, that's white salt. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1456.0s)]
*  This is a wild image. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1459.0s)]
*  This picture's got me. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1461.0s)]
*  Isn't it amazing? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1462.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1463.0s)]
*  God, it's amazing. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1464.0s)]
*  You can keep digging in like that. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1466.0s)]
*  So these ripples, when you pan out, so the ones that Randall had showed you, those were something like closer to 300 feet apart and 50 feet high. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1468.0s)]
*  I've measured these more than 3,000 feet to 6,600 feet in between each ripple and more than 200 feet high. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1477.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1483.0s)]
*  So if these are indeed caused from like ripples that you see on the beach from catastrophic flooding, this is a force of water that is truly, it goes beyond the mind's comprehension. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1484.0s)]
*  It's something that I don't think we could even understand. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1496.0s)]
*  But if you pan out, you have people have to understand that this is a couple hundred miles from one side to the other. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1499.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1504.0s)]
*  And so this is this is this would have been a force of floodwater that I think goes beyond anything we could have thought possible. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1505.0s)]
*  I think this is why scientists have somehow missed it, because I don't know how to say this, but no one else seems to be talking about this. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1510.0s)]
*  Now, the structure that you think is Atlantis, how tall are those concentric rings? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1516.0s)]
*  So it is the entire structure from one side to the other is nearly 30 miles, but the interior structure of the concentric circles is 16 miles. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1521.0s)]
*  And this is one argument that's made against it, is that the the size dimensions that Plato had gave are significantly smaller. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1529.0s)]
*  And so but I I would make two arguments on this one. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1538.0s)]
*  This is a 12,000 year old story. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1542.0s)]
*  And I would argue that it is impossible for over 12,000 years to keep. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1544.0s)]
*  To carry down precise translations because of how often is it from the translations? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1549.0s)]
*  Oh, significantly. The the entire site would be a small circle inside the middle of the circle. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1555.0s)]
*  But here's the reason why I think those mention dimensions are wrong is because Atlantis was said to be busy all day and all night. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1560.0s)]
*  And I would compare that to any modern city today, which you could argue would be a population within the millions. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1568.0s)]
*  So if it was as small as Plato described, it wouldn't be feasible to suggest that millions of people would have lived there. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1573.0s)]
*  And I'll make one other little point, which is that because many people posit that it could be in the Atlantic Ocean like that the Azores. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1579.0s)]
*  And I think that's a phenomenal argument for that. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1585.0s)]
*  But one if I was to defend the wrist shot or I would say that if this was a place that was spoken from languages of all over and was said to be a trading hub, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1587.0s)]
*  I don't think that it would be as feasible to suggest that Atlantis would be in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean as opposed to West Africa, which was green at the time. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1597.0s)]
*  This whole area was connected by a network of rivers, which I should have some slides close to the coast. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1606.0s)]
*  Right. Boats and you wouldn't have to venture out in the middle of the ocean as you described in your video. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1610.0s)]
*  You make a very, very compelling argument. My question, though, how tall those circles like how high do those things go? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1615.0s)]
*  I want to say 60 feet from 60 to actually no, no, excuse me. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1622.0s)]
*  I want to say 100 feet at some of the highest points down to the salt. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1626.0s)]
*  I'd have to remeasure it. But if Jamie, if you go over, did you go there personally? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1629.0s)]
*  No. So I have in fact, let me give them a shout out. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1633.0s)]
*  Josh Sigurdsson and David Stig Hansen went there individually. These are some intrepid fellows. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1635.0s)]
*  It is a gutsy trip. Josh almost died because you have to drive through a minefield to go there. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1641.0s)]
*  He saw actual skeletons like an AK pointed at his head. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1645.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a wild ass place. Yeah. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1648.0s)]
*  You have to drive through a fucking minefield to get there. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1651.0s)]
*  He had bowls of steel that year. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1654.0s)]
*  He's an intrepid fellow. Same with David. And to be honest, like I don't look, I don't. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1656.0s)]
*  I'd rather fly over it. If someone wants to fly me over it, I'd love to get some great pictures. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1661.0s)]
*  They shoot at the helicopter. And that's nothing. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1665.0s)]
*  I don't want to trash Mortania because I've heard from people have gone there. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1668.0s)]
*  They met the nicest people they've ever met in their lives. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1671.0s)]
*  As long as they're not shooting you, they're nice. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1673.0s)]
*  But it's worth mentioning that, I know. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1675.0s)]
*  Well, there's all the gold there too. I would imagine they would want to protect that gold. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1677.0s)]
*  Which is why they won't let you do ground radar here. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1681.0s)]
*  So Josh brought out ground radar equipment and they threatened imprisonment. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1683.0s)]
*  And apparently this is one of those countries where they will cut off your fingers if you get caught stealing potentially. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1686.0s)]
*  And this is a country that it wasn't until the 80s, as well as additional law legislation in like 2007, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1691.0s)]
*  where to abolish slavery, but apparently it's not being enforced. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1698.0s)]
*  So there are still slaves in Mortania. So I'm like, when I hear details like this, it makes me just not feel like driving out there. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1701.0s)]
*  Do they know that people think that's Atlantis? Are they aware of this? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1708.0s)]
*  It's growing. Yeah, people are now talking about it. People are venturing out there. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1711.0s)]
*  They have this on their currency, the picture of the wrist shot. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1716.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, just the whole term of Atlantis too, we do tend to focus on it being like a single city, a single thing. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1720.0s)]
*  And I was chatting with Randall about this just last night and he was saying, you know, there were colonies, there were outposts. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1727.0s)]
*  They would have had a global kind of outpost all around the world. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1734.0s)]
*  So it's possible, even likely, that Atlantis existed in various different places. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1738.0s)]
*  And it's almost a term now that, you know, you say Atlantis, it gets this connotation to it. It's almost a pseudo-archaeological term. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1743.0s)]
*  But we thought that about Troy as well. We did. Troy is another one. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1751.0s)]
*  Troy is one until what year was Troy actually physically discovered? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1755.0s)]
*  1890, 18 something like that, late 1890s, I want to say. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1759.0s)]
*  So up until that moment, they thought that Troy was just a myth. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1763.0s)]
*  Fantasy. Yeah, just fantasy. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1766.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, people used to take Atlantis a lot more seriously. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1768.0s)]
*  It was something happened. In the 1960s, there was a lot of legitimate scientific work being done on the In the Azores region, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1772.0s)]
*  looking at the possibility of subversion and can there be large parts of land that sink. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1778.0s)]
*  And then something happened where it's like the establishment just turned on it and it became this pseudo term. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1783.0s)]
*  And anyone who mentioned it was kind of dismissed and shaken off in the same way that, you know, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1789.0s)]
*  they're treating guys like Hancock and with his ancient apocalypse series are now. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1794.0s)]
*  But I don't know. I don't know specifically what happened, but it used to be taken a lot more seriously. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1798.0s)]
*  And there's certainly a lot of evidence coming from prior cultures that something did exist. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1802.0s)]
*  And I think now we've got a massive body of evidence that suggests our history as a species and as a civilization. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1807.0s)]
*  Goes way back much further than than what we've thought about as being our own history since, you know, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1812.0s)]
*  I mean, right up until 2006, we pretty much thought, no, the last six thousand years, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1818.0s)]
*  that's when we stopped being cavemen and became, you know, started building cities and organized societies and things like that. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1822.0s)]
*  And that's the gatekeepers of academia. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1827.0s)]
*  You know, just the stuff that you two gentlemen put on your YouTube pages should open up fields of inquiry. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1831.0s)]
*  People should be reaching out to you. They should be having you speak at universities. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1839.0s)]
*  They should be watching your videos. They should be like, oh, my God, like, look at all this actual evidence, not speculation, not like look. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1844.0s)]
*  You're looking at physical, geological evidence, physical erosion evidence. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1853.0s)]
*  And then all the stuff with the structure that lines up exactly with the stories of Atlantis, it's fucking wild. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1858.0s)]
*  It's it's one of these things like I'm a very open minded person. I'm not I can't say like with 100 percent certainty. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1867.0s)]
*  I mean, anything's possible, of course, but even but I'm like, there's so many similarities that if nothing else, it shouldn't be ignored. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1872.0s)]
*  The off the West Coast should be drilled and run with some LIDAR to see what's going on underneath that sediment. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1878.0s)]
*  And not only that, like, let's just pretend, OK, Atlantis never existed. The Rishaw, it's not it. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1884.0s)]
*  Well, then that's like focus in then on why is this catastrophic water erosion going through the Sahara 60 million years more recently than it was supposed to? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1889.0s)]
*  There's another image in there, Jamie, that shows where the Trans-Saharan Seaway went. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1898.0s)]
*  And it does not reflect it going west over the Western Sahara. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1902.0s)]
*  So I'm like in the context of climate science, I'm like this should be discussed. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1905.0s)]
*  Why is nobody talking about the Sahara was green potentially 4500 years ago, which is, by the way, the same alleged date as the Great Pyramids construction in Giza. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1909.0s)]
*  Forty five hundred years ago. So check this out. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1918.0s)]
*  As you can see, it does not annotate the water erosion going west over the Rishaw. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1921.0s)]
*  But as we just showed, it clearly did. And this was based on a 20 year study. Wonderful people did this. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1927.0s)]
*  I don't know. I have no explanation for why they don't annotate it going west, but it clearly did. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1932.0s)]
*  And not only that, it went east of Niger along Chad, which, you know, I showed you the water erosion along the volcano. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1938.0s)]
*  So what I'm suggesting is that either something else separate happened or they just missed something because, again, the Sahara is a big place and they can only search so many places. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1945.0s)]
*  When they did this, did they have the sort of satellite imagery that are available today? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1952.0s)]
*  No. Well, I can't say no. Satellites were certainly around. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1956.0s)]
*  What year was this? This is like I want to say 2007 or so. I could be wrong. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1959.0s)]
*  And I got to double check that. I would have had satellite. Yeah. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1964.0s)]
*  Yeah. So but I know that they were doing some boots on the ground stuff. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1967.0s)]
*  Maybe they just didn't think to look at that particular area as being maybe they had like a preconceived notion. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1970.0s)]
*  That's what I suspect. I don't think they are intentionally not looking at it. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1978.0s)]
*  But I feel like, you know, when it comes to, you know, you're mentioning that we should be speaking at universities. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1981.0s)]
*  You know, Joe, the first thing they ever say is like, oh, Jimmy, he was a fraud investigators from the corporate world. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1986.0s)]
*  Ben has an awesome story, too, by the way, coming out of the corporate world. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1991.0s)]
*  You got we could get into that. Yeah. You got patents with a tech guy. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1995.0s)]
*  We'll get into that. But like so that's the immediately dismiss. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=1999.0s)]
*  And I want to make an interesting point, which is that so crazy that their gatekeepers. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2002.0s)]
*  Yeah. They will. Ego centric, ego minded gatekeepers. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2006.0s)]
*  Like they don't want anyone to discover something they haven't noticed. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2010.0s)]
*  100 percent. It is it is totally what they do. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2014.0s)]
*  It's almost unbelievable coming as like an outsider to this. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2018.0s)]
*  I couldn't be more surprised to see the reactions to anything alternative because it's like, wait a second, the success of the things that we present, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2020.0s)]
*  the success of Graham Hancock's Ancient Apocalypse show this any true enthusiasts of the ancient of ancient history or geology. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2028.0s)]
*  This is a win win for everybody because it's gaining interest in these unanswered questions and everybody would stand to gain from it. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2035.0s)]
*  Like archaeologists, like if it was up to me, they'd be out there digging right now because of this stuff. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2042.0s)]
*  The problem is they have already made these assertions. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2046.0s)]
*  They've already published papers, they've already written books, and those books would now be disproven and they would look foolish. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2050.0s)]
*  And they do not want to look foolish. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2056.0s)]
*  It's it's they're throwing everything at ancient apocalypse. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2058.0s)]
*  They really are. Every word in the book. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2062.0s)]
*  I don't want to racism. Yeah. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2064.0s)]
*  White supremacy. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2066.0s)]
*  How is it white supremacy to say that people who lived 12,000 years ago, we have zero idea what color they were. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2067.0s)]
*  We have zero idea what they looked like. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2074.0s)]
*  We were literally talking about human beings, fellow human beings that created some unbelievably magnificent structures that exist today. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2076.0s)]
*  Yeah. To call that or somehow or another connect that to racism. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2087.0s)]
*  Like how? It's it's ad hominem. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2091.0s)]
*  The only reason why you would do this, it's one of two things. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2093.0s)]
*  I've listened to their arguments and it's either one of I'm just going to say it. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2095.0s)]
*  I'll be bold. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2098.0s)]
*  They're either really stupid to associate that with racism or they're doing exactly what I see going for anyone that says something counter to a narrative, which is we need to cancel this person. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2099.0s)]
*  Shut them up. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2109.0s)]
*  And I had a friend reach out to me when the show came out and they Googled. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2110.0s)]
*  I didn't want to say this, but it has to be said. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2114.0s)]
*  They Googled Graham Hancock and there's articles at the top linking him to white supremacy. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2116.0s)]
*  I'm like, this is in my mind. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2120.0s)]
*  That's why they do it, because they want to just shout some doubt on you. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2122.0s)]
*  It's going to generate outrage without addressing the things that he says and addressing his specific arguments. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2124.0s)]
*  It's so dense. Married to an Indian woman. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2130.0s)]
*  Everything about it is fucking dumb. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2131.0s)]
*  And he's one of the nicest guy in the world. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2133.0s)]
*  I know Graham pretty well, too. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2136.0s)]
*  He's yeah, he is. He's one of the most considerate people you ever meet. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2137.0s)]
*  He's so nice and he's just so inquisitive and he's been so courageous his entire career. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2139.0s)]
*  And the more time goes on, the more he's validated. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2145.0s)]
*  It's true. Really? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2148.0s)]
*  Yes. I mean, you go back to Fingerprints of the Gods. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2149.0s)]
*  I read about that in the 90s. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2151.0s)]
*  I read that book in the 90s and that's when I got really into his stuff. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2153.0s)]
*  And back then, if you brought it up, people go, oh, he's a kook. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2156.0s)]
*  But as the Internet came about and as more and more information became available [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2159.0s)]
*  and then the discovery of Gobekli Tepe just threw the whole thing on its head. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2164.0s)]
*  I would argue he's done more to, sorry, Ben, let's work quick. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2168.0s)]
*  He's done more for bringing the topic of the mysteries of lost ancient civilizations, cataclysms, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2171.0s)]
*  than arguably anyone else on Earth. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2179.0s)]
*  Because of him, I saw him on your show. I go down the rabbit hole and start looking. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2181.0s)]
*  I start talking about these things. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2184.0s)]
*  So it's like everyone should be saying thank you to Graham Hancock. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2186.0s)]
*  They're just so scared that he's going to make them look like fools [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2189.0s)]
*  because they wrote these books when they had limited access to information [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2193.0s)]
*  and they made these very direct assertions. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2197.0s)]
*  This is what happened and they're wrong. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2202.0s)]
*  It's a position of power. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2205.0s)]
*  Archaeology not being a hard science that does hypothesis, experiment, and result [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2207.0s)]
*  like you can do in things like chemistry, for example. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2212.0s)]
*  These guys, they rise to their positions of powers. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2215.0s)]
*  In academia, their whole personal sense of self is somehow tied up around this position as an expert in this story. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2219.0s)]
*  And that's all it is. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2227.0s)]
*  Ultimately, we're trying to interpret the very scant evidence that is history. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2229.0s)]
*  Looking through the bones of many civilizations, people have destroyed things, rebuilt them, destroyed them, rebuilt them. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2233.0s)]
*  You're trying to put that together and evaluate this evidence. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2238.0s)]
*  And yeah, they write the textbooks and they kind of have that position of power. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2241.0s)]
*  And when new evidence comes along that I think threatens that, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2245.0s)]
*  that's why you get in some ways such a strong reaction because you're almost threatening the person. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2248.0s)]
*  I think they take it that way. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2253.0s)]
*  And it's unfortunate. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2255.0s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen the original discussion that Graham had with Dr. Robert Schock [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2256.0s)]
*  when they brought the evidence of the water erosion to the Sphinx. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2265.0s)]
*  And then that archaeologists like laughing, but like not really laughing. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2268.0s)]
*  What evidence do we have of an ancient civilization 11,000 years ago? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2274.0s)]
*  Well, now we have a lot, fuck face. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2280.0s)]
*  There's a lot. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2282.0s)]
*  Well, there's, there's, Gobekli Tepe is massive. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2283.0s)]
*  And then there's another structure that's close to Gobekli Tepe. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2285.0s)]
*  Karahan Tepe. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2287.0s)]
*  In fact, they're describing many of them now. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2288.0s)]
*  It's, it's, yeah, it's not only that the whole story, as we're told it in Dynastic Egypt, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2290.0s)]
*  just doesn't make sense from a number of different perspectives. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2294.0s)]
*  It's as if they arose out of nowhere, like perfect and then degraded over time. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2296.0s)]
*  When you think about it, things like the pyramids, I mean, those are the first pyramids ever made. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2301.0s)]
*  Like these massive megalithic stone pyramids that have all of these different elements of sacred geometry [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2306.0s)]
*  and precision and all these different aspects of incredible engineering built into them. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2311.0s)]
*  They did. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2315.0s)]
*  That's apparently what they did first. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2316.0s)]
*  They kept building pyramids after that time. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2317.0s)]
*  And they sucked. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2320.0s)]
*  They sucked. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2321.0s)]
*  Well, they're adobe. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2322.0s)]
*  They're made from mud brick. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2323.0s)]
*  Well, they don't really know. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2324.0s)]
*  That's what's, what do you got here, Jeremy? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2325.0s)]
*  Karahan Tepe. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2326.0s)]
*  Karahan Tepe. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2327.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2328.0s)]
*  I'm going to be there in April. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2329.0s)]
*  Are you really? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2330.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2331.0s)]
*  Look at that face. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2332.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2333.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at that face. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2334.0s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2335.0s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2336.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2337.0s)]
*  Doesn't that look scary? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2338.0s)]
*  I remember the video that showed the similarities, not just between pyramids, but between construction [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2339.0s)]
*  methods all over the world in Japan. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2344.4s)]
*  I had no idea that they had made the sarcophagus covers in Japan that were exactly the same [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2347.0s)]
*  shape as the one, and odd, oddly shaped, exactly the same as the ones they made in Egypt. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2354.4s)]
*  And in a place, there is supposed to be zero connection between ancient Japan and ancient [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2361.6s)]
*  Egypt. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2365.48s)]
*  That's not supposed to exist. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2366.48s)]
*  If you compare that sarcophagus work, it looks unbelievably, uncannily similar. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2367.96s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2372.16s)]
*  It's almost impossible that two people would come up with the same design. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2373.16s)]
*  Because it's like coming up with, I don't know, I don't have a good, if someone like [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2377.0s)]
*  this lighter, if someone, I mean, this is an unusually shaped lighter, the way the top [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2383.68s)]
*  pops. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2388.68s)]
*  If someone just coincidentally, without any internet, came up with this on the other side [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2389.68s)]
*  of the planet, be like, how the fuck? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2393.64s)]
*  It's so oddly shaped. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2395.68s)]
*  The buttons in the same place, the lids in the same place, there's no way. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2397.6s)]
*  That's what it looks like to me. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2401.68s)]
*  And the fact that it took an enormous amount of effort to make and move and put it into [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2403.04s)]
*  place, because you're talking about incredibly heavy stone. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2408.0s)]
*  And hard stone. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2411.3599999999997s)]
*  Like that's the other people don't appreciate just how hard this igneous stone is that these [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2412.3599999999997s)]
*  things are made from. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2415.8799999999997s)]
*  Granite, granodiorite, cyanite, these are harder than steel. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2416.8799999999997s)]
*  There's 6.57 on the Mohs scale. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2422.28s)]
*  It's incredible work. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2425.36s)]
*  And the fact that these similar construction methods existed in Peru, they existed in Egypt, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2426.36s)]
*  they existed in Japan, and we don't know how old stone is. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2432.28s)]
*  That's what's really wacky. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2437.16s)]
*  When we talk about carbon dating, they're not carbon dating stone. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2438.16s)]
*  They really don't know. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2442.6s)]
*  So even when they go back to ancient Egypt and they say, oh, we date the pyramids construction [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2444.18s)]
*  2500 BC, it's a fucking guess. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2449.32s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2452.24s)]
*  It's a guess. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2453.24s)]
*  It really is. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2454.24s)]
*  It has to be a guess. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2455.24s)]
*  It really can't be anything other than a guess. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2456.24s)]
*  They can measure organic matter. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2458.2s)]
*  They can measure stuff that's in between the stones. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2460.46s)]
*  But we have no idea when that was put there. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2462.52s)]
*  If something existed for tens of thousands of years before we're dating it, we really [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2464.78s)]
*  wouldn't know. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2470.72s)]
*  We would have evidence that these, of course people would still live there. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2472.02s)]
*  Of course people would still live around them. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2475.4s)]
*  We would have evidence that those people left stuff behind that was a certain age, but we [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2478.4799999999996s)]
*  have zero evidence as to how old those things are. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2482.56s)]
*  When I found that out, I was baffled. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2485.9599999999996s)]
*  Because I always thought they knew, 2500 BC, rock solid, this is it. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2487.7999999999997s)]
*  They tie it to the guy, the king. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2492.8599999999997s)]
*  They know when Khufu lived. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2495.52s)]
*  So they try and tie it. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2497.0s)]
*  And literally with the Great Pyramid, very little evidence. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2498.0s)]
*  There's like this big statue of him that they found down in the Valley Temple, nowhere near [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2500.52s)]
*  it. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2505.2s)]
*  There's a glyph on the inside. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2506.2s)]
*  There's a lot of controversy around that. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2507.48s)]
*  But there are some of these artifacts they do for that reason because they date a lot [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2509.4399999999996s)]
*  of stuff based on the site that they found it. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2515.3399999999997s)]
*  So if there's organic material at the site that they found it, and what's been, I've [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2517.8399999999997s)]
*  found that's kind of like a smoking gun piece in all of this, is all the vases. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2520.48s)]
*  So are you familiar with the incredible stone vases that they make in Egypt? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2525.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2528.3999999999996s)]
*  Please talk about them. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2529.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so there is a collection of these things. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2530.3999999999996s)]
*  They're made from igneous stone. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2532.7599999999998s)]
*  And Jamie, I've got a few pictures of the vases in that vase directory. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2534.32s)]
*  And they date back. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2537.6800000000003s)]
*  What's interesting to me about these is that they're some of the earliest types of artifacts [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2539.78s)]
*  that we find. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2544.88s)]
*  They stretch back far into what we'd call pre-dynastic time, basically Mesolithic times. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2545.88s)]
*  Right back to even 15,000 years ago, there was a site called Toshka that was dug up. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2550.4s)]
*  It's underwater now. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2555.96s)]
*  But in this, and it was a primitive burial. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2556.96s)]
*  There was a guy that was curled up in this burial site on the side. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2559.0s)]
*  Go back to that Jamie, the thin card one. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2563.92s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2566.2400000000002s)]
*  So this is an example. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2567.2400000000002s)]
*  And these vases display just astonishing aspects of precision and engineering. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2568.2400000000002s)]
*  So this is an example of just how thin this material is. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2572.6800000000003s)]
*  So it's igneous stone. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2575.7200000000003s)]
*  This might be porphyry or something like this. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2576.8s)]
*  A very, very hard stone, very hard to work, but also brittle when it becomes thin. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2579.12s)]
*  You can see the giant crystal occlusions, the white marks in it. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2583.44s)]
*  This stuff becomes brittle, yet it's been worked down to this thinness because this [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2587.0s)]
*  one's been damaged. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2590.7200000000003s)]
*  You can see how thin that interior wall is. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2591.72s)]
*  Flinders Petrie is a great Egyptologist, the first guy to really start applying engineering [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2595.0s)]
*  principles from the industrial age to this stuff. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2599.3999999999996s)]
*  He found one, he talks about one in his work that was one fortieth of an inch thick. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2601.8799999999997s)]
*  A fortieth of an inch thick. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2605.9599999999996s)]
*  And the interesting thing about these vases, there's 50,000 plus of them were discovered [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2608.0s)]
*  beneath the step pyramid of Joza. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2612.48s)]
*  He collected them all up. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2615.16s)]
*  And even in the museum that's at Saqqara, they talk about, yeah, this is so, I've been [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2616.66s)]
*  down underneath the step pyramid. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2620.4s)]
*  This is a fragment of one of these vases that I found you can handle down there. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2621.92s)]
*  And even in the museum there, they talk about, well, he didn't have the mate. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2626.48s)]
*  These were inherited objects from earlier times. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2630.44s)]
*  They get the concept right. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2632.92s)]
*  And so these things stretch back way back into time. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2634.96s)]
*  There's pre-dynastic artifacts from pre-dynastic burials. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2637.2400000000002s)]
*  But there's always these sort of arguments. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2640.4s)]
*  Well, can you do this by hand? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2641.88s)]
*  Can you not? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2643.28s)]
*  And so recently, there's been some work done. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2645.0s)]
*  I've been working with a couple of guys. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2647.08s)]
*  The son of Christopher Dunn, who wrote some real seminal textbooks on ancient Egyptian [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2648.92s)]
*  technology, his son Alex and Nick Sierra, they're called professional metrologists. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2653.64s)]
*  They work for Rolls-Royce in Indianapolis. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2659.6800000000003s)]
*  They make aerospace parts, turbine blades, things like that. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2661.96s)]
*  They've got their hands on a pre-dynastic Egyptian vase. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2665.84s)]
*  And for the first time, they've actually been able to scan this thing using a structured [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2669.76s)]
*  light scanner and define the specific elements of precision on it. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2674.08s)]
*  And it's just astounding. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2678.32s)]
*  This puts the whole concept of, can these even remotely be made by hand to bed? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2681.1200000000003s)]
*  These things had to have been made on a machine and made with extreme precision because this [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2686.0400000000004s)]
*  vase that is pre-dynastic, this is a picture of the vase here that they found in a private [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2691.6400000000003s)]
*  collection because I should say, generally archaeologists, Egyptologists, they're not [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2696.2400000000002s)]
*  engineers. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2700.96s)]
*  They're not particularly interested in how things were manufactured. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2702.0400000000004s)]
*  So what they've done is they've taken this and put this in a machine and it's a structured [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2705.8s)]
*  light scanner. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2710.2000000000003s)]
*  So it creates like a point cloud of different lights and then you match a geometric shape [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2711.2000000000003s)]
*  to it, be that like a flat plane, a cylinder, a sphere, a cone, and then you can perform [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2715.5600000000004s)]
*  sort of geometric calculations on it and define things like precision. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2720.36s)]
*  So if you go back to the surface, the vase lip, right? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2724.4s)]
*  So this is, you can see down on the bottom, they've created a point cloud of the top of [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2728.36s)]
*  this lip, so the flatness and they've called this surface A. It's comprised of 3,813 points [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2733.48s)]
*  and it's within three thousandths of an inch of being basically perfectly flat. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2740.7200000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2746.12s)]
*  Three thousandths of an inch. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2747.12s)]
*  And this is over who knows how many thousands of years of erosion and sand and dust and [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2749.64s)]
*  wind. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2755.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2756.36s)]
*  It's at least 5,000 years old. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2757.36s)]
*  I suspect this could be far older than that. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2759.0s)]
*  Now what's interesting, once you start doing this, and if you go to the next one, Jamie, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2760.88s)]
*  now we're looking at the lip. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2766.12s)]
*  So you take a cylinder and you basically take 10,000 points plus and you match the inside, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2767.6400000000003s)]
*  the mouth of the vase to a cylinder and you can now measure that against the other surface. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2773.6400000000003s)]
*  So if you think of the top of it as being like the X axis, this is now your Y axis. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2779.52s)]
*  So that first symbol here, the perpendicular symbol, what it's showing is how perpendicular [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2783.6600000000003s)]
*  is this cylinder on its axis relative to the top of the vase, the surface A that's on the [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2789.3599999999997s)]
*  top, within one thousandth of an inch. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2795.16s)]
*  So it's perfectly perpendicular to within one thousandth of an inch of the top of the [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2798.52s)]
*  vase and then the second reading here shows you how perfectly, what's the circular error, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2803.56s)]
*  like what's the circularity of it within 13,000th of an inch of being perfectly circular. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2808.56s)]
*  How are you going to do that by hand? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2812.8799999999997s)]
*  Well you can't. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2815.3999999999996s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2816.3999999999996s)]
*  You literally can't? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2817.88s)]
*  No, no one's ever been at you. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2818.88s)]
*  If you rub two surfaces together you can make them flat. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2823.1600000000003s)]
*  But when you start looking at the real teller in precision and in these discussions about [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2826.04s)]
*  ancient engineering, it's an easy thing to understand when we talk about 90 degree turns [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2831.0s)]
*  and flat surfaces. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2836.12s)]
*  But what gets really interesting is when you start talking about one surface in relation [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2837.7200000000003s)]
*  to another and remember these objects like the big boxes in the Serapium that weigh like [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2841.78s)]
*  70 tonnes, you've got surfaces 11 feet apart, it's the relativity of one surface to another. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2845.68s)]
*  So how flat, how straight is this in relationship to this surface? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2852.0s)]
*  And with this vase, the incredible thing about it is that as you go down it, there's another [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2856.32s)]
*  slide if you can look at the... [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2862.24s)]
*  And you should mention how much this equipment costs real quick. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2865.16s)]
*  Well yeah, so these structured light scanners are like $250,000. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2867.28s)]
*  This is absolutely a tool that gets used in aerospace quite a bit. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2872.56s)]
*  So no one's ever really done this type of work. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2875.36s)]
*  And it does, there's nothing like this approaching, you can't do this with hand work, this type [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2880.44s)]
*  of thing. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2884.56s)]
*  But if you skip to the next one, so now this is a great example. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2885.56s)]
*  So what you're doing here is measuring the circularity. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2890.36s)]
*  Go to the next one because the lug handles are kind of the really important part of this. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2892.48s)]
*  It's an interesting thing. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2896.72s)]
*  So for one thing it's showing you that, okay, they solved the problem of carving granite. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2897.72s)]
*  It's made from granite. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2901.08s)]
*  It's made from the same rose granite that the box in the King's chamber of the Great [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2902.08s)]
*  Pyramid is. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2905.36s)]
*  Not pottery, just in case someone doesn't understand what this is. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2906.56s)]
*  This isn't pottery. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2909.24s)]
*  People often call it pottery. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2910.24s)]
*  Can I pause real quick? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2911.24s)]
*  When you talk about these measurements, what kind of measurements can be achieved through [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2912.64s)]
*  ceramic pottery? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2917.0s)]
*  Well ceramic pottery, if you're spinning on a wheel, I'm not even sure. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2918.52s)]
*  You might be able to get down to tenths of an inch or half. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2922.64s)]
*  But you would never get to a thousandths of an inch. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2927.44s)]
*  Not to a thousandth, no. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2928.7999999999997s)]
*  And this is carved. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2930.2s)]
*  This is carved out of stone. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2931.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2932.24s)]
*  But I'm just saying, if you think about a pottery wheel spinning and you think about [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2933.24s)]
*  the precision involved in that and you look at it, it's beautiful, it seems symmetrical, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2937.68s)]
*  it seems amazing. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2942.04s)]
*  But nothing compared to this kind of symmetry. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2943.2s)]
*  To give you an example, a thousandth of an inch, if you take a sheet of printed paper [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2945.96s)]
*  like this, that's about seven and a half thousandths thick. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2949.9199999999996s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2953.9199999999996s)]
*  A human hair, two to three thousandths of an inch. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2954.9199999999996s)]
*  So it's half the size of a human hair. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2957.2s)]
*  Of being perfect. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2962.0s)]
*  Of being perfect. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2963.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2964.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2965.0s)]
*  That's how precisely aligned the mouth of the vase is. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2966.0s)]
*  So again, we've carved this out of stone and remember, even the Egyptologists don't say [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2969.64s)]
*  that they're not spun, they're not cast and created. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2974.7999999999997s)]
*  They say that the Egyptians used very primitive tools to make these pounding stones, chisels, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2978.0s)]
*  flint chisels. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2983.64s)]
*  What would they say in the face of this overwhelming data? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2984.8399999999997s)]
*  They don't, so they don't address it. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2987.24s)]
*  In general, they don't address the evidence for precision. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2989.08s)]
*  Should hold them down. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2991.3199999999997s)]
*  Huh? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2992.3199999999997s)]
*  Should hold them down. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2993.3199999999997s)]
*  This is what I'm... [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2994.3199999999997s)]
*  Like literally grab them and go, tell me what the fuck is going on. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2995.3199999999997s)]
*  This work should do a bit of that because there's always been arguments. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=2999.0s)]
*  How many of these are there? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3001.64s)]
*  It's not just one perfect one that you're talking about. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3003.8399999999997s)]
*  No, no. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3006.64s)]
*  This is the only one we've managed to scan so far and I would love to say that if, because [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3007.64s)]
*  you can't get your hands on these things, in general, curators of Egyptology museums [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3013.24s)]
*  aren't interested in their manufacturing or engineering and they don't gain it, you don't [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3017.72s)]
*  get access to these vases to do it. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3022.16s)]
*  This one came from a... [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3024.04s)]
*  How could they not be interested in that? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3025.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3026.56s)]
*  It blows my mind. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3027.9599999999996s)]
*  So here's an example of another perfect... [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3028.9599999999996s)]
*  I'd love to scan this one. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3030.52s)]
*  It's one of my favorites. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3031.52s)]
*  It's like you can see the symmetry inherent in the vase just in the fact that it's sitting [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3032.52s)]
*  on almost like an egg shell. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3035.18s)]
*  It's so perfect. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3038.3199999999997s)]
*  What that study is showing and what that precision that's now been measured is showing that, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3041.76s)]
*  okay, these were turned on a machine and not only were they turned on a machine, but when [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3046.48s)]
*  you think about the shape of the vase, it has these lug handles on each side. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3051.2s)]
*  They've got little holes here. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3054.68s)]
*  Those can't be turned. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3056.6s)]
*  If you think of it spinning and this is being carved by a machine, those lug handles can't [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3058.64s)]
*  be turned. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3062.76s)]
*  You would have to cut out a round thing around it and then take another tool and shape the [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3063.76s)]
*  lug handles without turning it. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3069.16s)]
*  In precision manufacturing, when you introduce another tool, that introduces error, even [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3071.32s)]
*  in our best processes today, and we just don't see that on this vase. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3075.48s)]
*  Those lug handles are within one thousandth of an inch of being perfectly aligned with [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3079.5600000000004s)]
*  those other surfaces of the vase. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3084.5600000000004s)]
*  It's that relativity of one section of the vase to another that means, A, unquestionably [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3087.0s)]
*  not possible by hand, but B, this has been designed. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3092.48s)]
*  They made a model of this and they had a very sophisticated bit of machinery that must [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3096.36s)]
*  have carved it out. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3101.04s)]
*  When we talk about this machinery, what's the speculation? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3102.8s)]
*  What do they think was used to carve these things? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3108.6400000000003s)]
*  Is there any markings on them that would indicate? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3111.6400000000003s)]
*  There is. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3115.6s)]
*  This is a whole other discussion when you get into the depths of this work. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3116.6s)]
*  When you look at ancient Egypt and the way that gets treated, they found tools. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3120.8s)]
*  I should say it's very rare to find metal in the ancient world. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3125.32s)]
*  As soon as the Bronze Age starts, any metal, super precious, gets smelted down, turned [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3127.96s)]
*  into tools, weapons, things like that. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3132.84s)]
*  It's very rare to find metal in general. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3134.5600000000004s)]
*  Across ancient Egypt, they found a bunch of tools. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3137.96s)]
*  They found some copper chisels, bronze chisels, very primitive stuff, some wooden squares [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3139.8s)]
*  and plumb bobs, pounding stones, flint chisels. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3145.4s)]
*  Those are the tools that are found. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3149.2000000000003s)]
*  In general, it's like the orthodoxy here and the academia will do everything they can [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3151.12s)]
*  to just hammer everything you find into this box and say, these are the tools we found, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3155.92s)]
*  so therefore everything's made by these tools. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3161.04s)]
*  Now, outside of that, there's a whole realm of what I would call machining marks that [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3163.6s)]
*  exist all over these sites in Egypt. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3168.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a place called Abu Seir that's been closed to the public for more than 100 years. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3170.0s)]
*  You have to get special permission to go there. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3173.72s)]
*  It's one of my favorite sites. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3175.2s)]
*  It's an old kingdom site, like Fifth Dynasty. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3176.3199999999997s)]
*  All over this site, you find amazing evidence for massive circular saws. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3179.88s)]
*  You see machining marks. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3184.6000000000004s)]
*  There are these tube drills. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3186.2000000000003s)]
*  I've got an hour-long documentary just on the tube drills because there's been an argument [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3187.48s)]
*  going on for 150 years about the tube drills. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3192.2000000000003s)]
*  There is evidence for very sophisticated and powerful tools that is etched into these artifacts [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3194.8s)]
*  from the very earliest points in Egypt all over the place. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3200.32s)]
*  A lot of these things, they disappear in later periods of time. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3203.6800000000003s)]
*  Go back to that image, Jamie, you just had. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3206.1200000000003s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3208.2400000000002s)]
*  Here's an example. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3209.24s)]
*  I didn't send you any of the machining marks, but I can show them to you at some point. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3210.24s)]
*  Yeah, so you find the tube drills are really interesting because it's a very thin tool. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3214.9599999999996s)]
*  What they would do, they range in size from a half inch up to nine inches. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3220.8799999999997s)]
*  Are those plugs that were removed from the stone? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3224.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3227.16s)]
*  It's like a hollow tool that gets cut down and then you snap off the core. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3228.16s)]
*  Now, Flinders Petrie, you're familiar with Petrie? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3231.9599999999996s)]
*  He was around late 1800s, early 1900s. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3235.9199999999996s)]
*  I use his work a lot in the stuff that I do because he was the first guy to apply engineering [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3239.4399999999996s)]
*  principles to what we saw, which is kind of this meta point that messes with my head a [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3245.12s)]
*  bit in that it took our civilization up to the industrial age to even be able to put [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3248.9599999999996s)]
*  some of this stuff into context. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3254.2799999999997s)]
*  Anyone else that looked at this stuff before we understood what machining was, what working [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3257.16s)]
*  in this stone was, what it looks like to cut stone with a circular saw, you don't have [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3260.64s)]
*  the context to explain it. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3265.6s)]
*  We had to get to the industrial age and develop mass manufacturing and engineering for us [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3267.04s)]
*  to even recognize what we're seeing here. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3271.7599999999998s)]
*  He found, there's a famous core, it's called Petrie's Core Number 7. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3274.32s)]
*  It's a drill core from one of these holes. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3279.44s)]
*  It's in Granite. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3280.96s)]
*  It's located in the Petrie Museum. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3282.2799999999997s)]
*  This museum is one that actually allows research appointments and you can analyze it. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3284.04s)]
*  It's been analyzed several times. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3287.7599999999998s)]
*  It's been an argument that's been going on for literally 150 years about this core because [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3289.6s)]
*  Petrie found and what Chris Dunn later verified. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3293.7999999999997s)]
*  That's Petrie's Core Number 7. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3298.2799999999997s)]
*  Exactly, right there. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3299.56s)]
*  That in fact might even be Chris Dunn's photo. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3300.56s)]
*  That groove that goes around it, very obvious striations. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3304.72s)]
*  It's been incontrovertibly shown that that's a spiral. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3308.72s)]
*  It's a spiral. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3313.04s)]
*  It's not like just horizontal striation. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3314.22s)]
*  If you can imagine the way we do it today, we have tube drills and core drills, spins [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3316.04s)]
*  really fast, makes lots of little marks. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3321.52s)]
*  There's been studies done looking at those sort of marks. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3323.76s)]
*  That's not what we're seeing here. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3326.28s)]
*  What we see here is a continuous spiral groove of at least two points. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3327.32s)]
*  It's a twin spiral that runs down the length of the core. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3331.08s)]
*  From that and analyzing that, you can determine a few things. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3335.32s)]
*  Things like how fast was this drill or how quickly was this drill penetrating the granite. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3338.2s)]
*  Petrie and Dunn both analyzed it and looked at it. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3344.96s)]
*  Well, it's about a one in 60 rate. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3347.0s)]
*  To reach, say, 60 inches of horizontal travel, it's going one inch into the stone. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3348.64s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3354.64s)]
*  If you take a spiral and straighten it out, and you just imagine, 60 inches this way, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3355.64s)]
*  you're getting one inch of vertical travel. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3361.44s)]
*  That figure is 500 times greater than we can achieve today in terms of how fast it penetrates [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3364.3199999999997s)]
*  the granite. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3372.2799999999997s)]
*  500 times greater. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3373.2799999999997s)]
*  500 times. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3374.2799999999997s)]
*  Now, it doesn't mean it cut quicker. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3375.2799999999997s)]
*  It could have been moving slowly. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3377.08s)]
*  It might have been turning slowly. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3378.48s)]
*  But it's penetrating the granite at a rate far greater than what we can achieve with [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3380.36s)]
*  our technology today. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3384.92s)]
*  This is why it's so important to bring outside eyes into this, whether it's an aerospace [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3388.08s)]
*  engineer. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3391.88s)]
*  Going back to Troy, that was discovered by a businessman. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3392.88s)]
*  He wasn't an archeologist. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3395.7999999999997s)]
*  That's something that most people don't know. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3397.2799999999997s)]
*  When you bring an outside set of eyes with different sets of experiences, they'll pick [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3398.96s)]
*  up on things that others wouldn't. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3402.12s)]
*  Look at that image, all the spiral lines around that. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3404.32s)]
*  That's just amazing. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3408.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3409.92s)]
*  You can go there. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3410.92s)]
*  I intend to do this. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3411.92s)]
*  I might be in the UK this year. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3412.92s)]
*  I intend to do that. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3413.92s)]
*  It's called the cotton wrap test. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3414.92s)]
*  You can actually, under a little microscope, run a piece of cotton through that groove. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3416.0s)]
*  Now, they actually took it a step further, and they made a latex molding of it. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3419.96s)]
*  They sent it to Chris Dunn. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3426.76s)]
*  The Petrie Museum did this. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3427.88s)]
*  Then he cut reference holes in it, cut it out, and then geometrically proved, basically, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3429.52s)]
*  that this is a spiral groove. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3434.24s)]
*  It definitely starts above the line. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3435.56s)]
*  It ends below the line. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3437.08s)]
*  He showed that that's it. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3438.3599999999997s)]
*  What I would love to see happen is we could get this core and then scan it with that structured [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3439.6s)]
*  light scanner, because it will put that stuff to bed. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3445.08s)]
*  No problem. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3447.8399999999997s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, this is a spiral groove. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3449.3999999999996s)]
*  The case has been closed, but people still argue the point. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3451.24s)]
*  It's 100% an indicator of some form of technology that's far away beyond the primitive stuff [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3455.2799999999997s)]
*  that we attribute to the dynastic Egyptians. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3460.8399999999997s)]
*  To me, it's an indicator that ... I don't think the dynastic Egyptians, they don't describe [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3463.16s)]
*  having this type of capability. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3468.44s)]
*  We've never found any tools from them that can do this type of thing. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3469.92s)]
*  I think what we're looking at here with dynastic Egypt is a story. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3472.92s)]
*  It's a longer timeline. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3476.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a story of inheritance. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3477.7599999999998s)]
*  I think they inherited a lot of artifacts, potentially some architecture, potentially [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3479.3199999999997s)]
*  parts of the pyramids or that type of thing. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3485.16s)]
*  Then that's where their culture grew from that. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3487.72s)]
*  They themselves describe their history as going back nearly 40,000 years. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3490.0s)]
*  They themselves look at them like a legacy culture. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3495.84s)]
*  This is in the Palermo Stone. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3500.2s)]
*  It's in the Turan Papyrus. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3501.6s)]
*  The priest Minethos talks about it. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3503.12s)]
*  There's a lot of different ... Yeah, so that actual yellow image in the center, that's [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3505.36s)]
*  the latex core ... No, up to the right. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3509.56s)]
*  Yeah, that one. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3512.28s)]
*  That's the latex core, the latex molding of core number seven. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3513.28s)]
*  The crazy thing is too, this is the only core that's really been analyzed. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3520.12s)]
*  These things, they're all over the place. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3523.9s)]
*  Lots of museums have them. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3526.32s)]
*  I'd love to see a body of work be built up with true analysis of it because ... [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3527.32s)]
*  Do they all have similar markings on them? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3530.68s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3533.8s)]
*  You can see the holes on a lot of the sites that seem to have a very clear striation on [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3534.8s)]
*  them. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3538.76s)]
*  Some of the tubes, the actual drill cores, if you like, seem to have it that way. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3539.76s)]
*  There were other techniques used. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3544.2400000000002s)]
*  The argument that ... How the mainstream archeologists describe them solving this problem is they [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3545.96s)]
*  had a copper tube and they got sand and they put a rock on top of the tube and a bow drill [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3552.16s)]
*  and they just went back and forth with this. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3557.08s)]
*  They did some experiments and look, grinding works ultimately because sand has little chunks [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3559.12s)]
*  of quartz and corundum in it, but it takes days and days and days to cut this much. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3563.76s)]
*  The markings and the machining doesn't look anything like what you see in the ancient [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3570.64s)]
*  examples. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3575.28s)]
*  What's more, and what's interesting here is that the actual drill cores that they found, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3576.28s)]
*  they're tapered. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3580.52s)]
*  Actually, they taper in like this. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3581.52s)]
*  The holes are straight, the cores are tapered. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3583.32s)]
*  It means that the tool itself must have had almost like a cone shape. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3586.1200000000003s)]
*  The thing that ... Some people say, well, those lines could have been created when the [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3591.5600000000004s)]
*  tool was removed. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3594.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm like, no. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3595.6400000000003s)]
*  If you think about a tapered tool like this, the second you take any pressure off it, the [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3597.36s)]
*  whole tool removes itself from the surface of the stone. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3601.4s)]
*  Those marks can't be made by withdrawal of the tool. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3604.2s)]
*  It's 100% something going on. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3608.2s)]
*  Petrie, back in the late 1800s, was scratching his head looking at this stuff and he goes, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3610.3999999999996s)]
*  there must have been a weight of two or three tons on one ... He said it was a jeweled tube [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3615.7999999999997s)]
*  of bronze that did this, but he was looking at it. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3621.8799999999997s)]
*  He knew a mystery when he saw it and he couldn't explain it. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3624.8399999999997s)]
*  What's the speculation? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3628.48s)]
*  What's the wildest speculation as to how these things were made? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3630.52s)]
*  I'm pretty convinced that there was ... There's obviously saws and tube drills that are powered [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3634.76s)]
*  by something. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3641.76s)]
*  Now, I think it may not just be pure friction. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3642.76s)]
*  There might be ultrasonics involved. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3645.0400000000004s)]
*  One of the whole interesting things I like about this space is it's like ... This has [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3647.5600000000004s)]
*  to do with even the energy stuff that Randall was talking about that he's coming to talk [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3651.32s)]
*  about as well. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3655.0s)]
*  There are realms of science that sit outside of our understanding. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3656.1200000000003s)]
*  We'll know more tomorrow in 10 years, in 1,000 years about science. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3659.2400000000002s)]
*  I think when we look at some of these things in the past, we should be open-minded enough [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3662.56s)]
*  to consider the possibility that some of the answers may sit outside of our current perspective [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3666.96s)]
*  because our tendency is to look at it all and try and ... How would we do it? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3670.92s)]
*  How would our technology solve this? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3675.12s)]
*  Does anybody have wild speculation that you've entertained? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3676.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3679.4s)]
*  One of the topics that often gets mentioned here is ultrasonic drilling. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3681.2s)]
*  Having it resonated a frequency that matches the native frequency of the rock and separating [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3686.2s)]
*  the rock more easily. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3690.44s)]
*  That's a technology that we're developing. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3693.36s)]
*  We do some ultrasonic drilling like this today with jewelry and stuff. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3694.96s)]
*  You literally vibrate. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3698.6800000000003s)]
*  You find the correct vibration. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3699.6800000000003s)]
*  You can put a little star-shaped bit through a stone. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3700.88s)]
*  They do it in small work. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3705.02s)]
*  I've seen lots of examples. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3706.2400000000002s)]
*  If you turn off the machine, it's like Excalibur stuck in the stone. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3707.56s)]
*  You can't get that thing out. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3710.52s)]
*  It takes ... You need that vibration to go through it. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3711.88s)]
*  Plasma, you can even go as far as well. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3714.92s)]
*  I was softening the stone somehow with some molecular technology. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3717.2s)]
*  Speculation like that. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3723.12s)]
*  I would also say that some of these examples of technology and machining extend way up [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3724.12s)]
*  to these massive objects. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3728.48s)]
*  You have thousand ton single piece objects that also exhibit some of these signs of precision [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3730.08s)]
*  engineering. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3736.12s)]
*  You might be talking about some truly giant machines that made them. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3737.12s)]
*  Giant columns and statues and things like that. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3740.72s)]
*  What do conventional archeologists say when they're confronted by all this data? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3743.72s)]
*  The pottery or the vases, this stuff that you're looking at here. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3749.48s)]
*  What do they say? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3755.68s)]
*  You either just get a denial and they won't address it and you get dismissed as just being [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3758.3999999999996s)]
*  ridiculous pseudo-archaeology fantasy theory type thing. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3765.16s)]
*  In the case of the tube drills, for example, they will ... It's a funny story because they [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3769.32s)]
*  will argue that, no, no, it's not spiral. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3773.84s)]
*  The grooves on that thing aren't spiral. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3776.1600000000003s)]
*  In fact, in the textbook, this is what Chris Dunn found out. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3777.88s)]
*  In the textbook where they do try to address the engineering with that tube drill, they [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3781.1200000000003s)]
*  took the photo of the tube drill and they just tilted it just a little bit. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3785.04s)]
*  When you look at it on the page, the lines look horizontal. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3788.8s)]
*  It's literally in the textbook. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3792.44s)]
*  Oh, they fucked with it in the textbook? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3793.92s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3795.96s)]
*  They altered the photo because if you admit that that tube has a spiral groove on it, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3797.2s)]
*  now you're admitting that they're cutting into that granite at a ridiculous rate and [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3805.2400000000002s)]
*  you can't do any of that stuff with any of the primitive tools. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3808.7200000000003s)]
*  It has this flow-on effect that just knocks over this house of cards that says, all this [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3811.68s)]
*  stuff was built with primitive technology and our whole concept of the ancient Egyptians [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3815.44s)]
*  is off. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3819.4s)]
*  Now, I don't think it's ... I think the dynastic Egyptians, they used primitive tools. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3820.4s)]
*  I think they just inherited a lot of stuff that's potentially a lot older. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3824.56s)]
*  The proofs in the puddings with these vases, for example, those things disappear from dynastic [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3830.4s)]
*  Egypt after the third, fourth dynasty. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3836.24s)]
*  They don't make them anymore. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3838.48s)]
*  They make alabaster vases. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3839.48s)]
*  Is that a tool? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3840.48s)]
*  What is that? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3841.48s)]
*  That's a fantastic example of what I would call an out of place artifact. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3842.48s)]
*  It's a hollow tube of lapis lazuli, which by the way, there's no quarries for lapis [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3846.2s)]
*  in Egypt. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3850.44s)]
*  The closest one's probably in Afghanistan. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3851.44s)]
*  It came from Gebel, found in a pre-dynastic site. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3854.44s)]
*  It's hollowed. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3857.04s)]
*  It's perfectly made. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3858.28s)]
*  This is a very difficult thing to achieve, even with modern machinery. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3859.28s)]
*  It's displayed in a cabinet next to what? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3863.2000000000003s)]
*  Bone and beads. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3865.16s)]
*  What is that? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3868.16s)]
*  What is that supposed to be? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3869.16s)]
*  That tube. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3870.8s)]
*  It's something decorative, I assume. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3871.8s)]
*  It has a gold sheath, but it's a hollow tube. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3873.08s)]
*  I actually have pictures of it from the end on, not probably in the ones you have, Jamie. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3875.56s)]
*  Yeah, hollow tube. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3879.08s)]
*  It's an out of place artifact. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3880.32s)]
*  These things from hardstone, and these are more examples, rock crystal obsidian gourds [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3882.04s)]
*  and vases that show just perfect, just very high degrees of sophistication. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3887.14s)]
*  You should mention the statue faces in the cemetery. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3892.72s)]
*  How can you possibly do that by hand? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3896.4s)]
*  This will wow you. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3898.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3899.24s)]
*  There's a whole category of aspects to the discussion around ancient technology. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3900.24s)]
*  I have to be kind of careful about what you say, oh, it is or it isn't, because in reality [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3906.64s)]
*  we really haven't analyzed that many artifacts. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3909.88s)]
*  This vase work that we've done, first one we've actually taken a look at. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3912.02s)]
*  That core is the first one and the only one that's really been analyzed. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3916.78s)]
*  I characterize something that's beyond the capabilities of these primitive ancient civilizations [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3921.2599999999998s)]
*  as being, okay, machining marks, tool marks, like these giant circular source tube drills, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3926.06s)]
*  precision, and there's elements to precision, and one of those is symmetry. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3931.42s)]
*  There's been some interesting studies done on the faces of giant statues. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3936.06s)]
*  One in particular is the face of Ramses. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3939.1s)]
*  It's a statue at Luxor. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3941.54s)]
*  They've since put the head back up. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3943.22s)]
*  It's up now 30 feet in the air on top of the statue, but it used to be on the ground. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3944.56s)]
*  Again, Chris Dunn was real seminal in this. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3947.94s)]
*  He went and took a photo, like bang on, like very front on, and then what he did was you [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3950.14s)]
*  take a copy of that photo, you make it 50% transparent, make the original 50% transparent, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3956.06s)]
*  you take one and you flip it on that horizontal axis, then you overlay them. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3960.62s)]
*  You would see the left to right, it's like overlaying the left side on the right side, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3965.66s)]
*  and it's perfect. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3970.98s)]
*  It's this face here, but I wonder if you can find the picture of Chris Dunn. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3972.86s)]
*  That's actually my video. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3975.98s)]
*  There's your video right there. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3976.98s)]
*  The video is there as well, where I get into it. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3977.98s)]
*  It's not the picture you're asking for. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3978.98s)]
*  No, it's similar, but it shows other aspects of, well, the same radius of tool being used [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3981.1s)]
*  to cut. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3986.1800000000003s)]
*  What's interesting about the symmetry, it's perfectly symmetrical, left to right. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3987.1800000000003s)]
*  Now, this isn't a feature in humans. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3990.5s)]
*  No human is perfectly symmetrical, different nostrils, different eyeballs. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3994.1800000000003s)]
*  It's also not something that is done in artwork. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=3998.42s)]
*  People often say, well, Michelangelo, he carved David. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4002.42s)]
*  It's a beautiful statue I've seen. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4005.1s)]
*  It's incredible, but it's human. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4006.7400000000002s)]
*  It's not symmetrical. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4009.2200000000003s)]
*  Symmetrical is, again, you can't achieve that degree of symmetry just by eyeballing [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4010.62s)]
*  it and doing it by hand. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4015.46s)]
*  It's also something that's not really human. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4017.54s)]
*  I think some of these statues almost look a bit inhuman because of that symmetry when [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4019.26s)]
*  they're up there and they're staring at you, because it's mind-blowing to actually go and [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4023.5s)]
*  look at them. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4026.9s)]
*  The other aspect is the most efficient way to create that would be to say, well, if you [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4030.1800000000003s)]
*  were going to design it in a computer, it's like, well, I'm going to create half this [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4034.6600000000003s)]
*  face in a program and map it out, and then I'm just going to reverse it and say, well, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4037.26s)]
*  that's the other half. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4041.94s)]
*  It's literally the most efficient way to do it, and that's kind of what we're seeing in [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4043.08s)]
*  some of these statues. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4046.58s)]
*  Go back to that image, please. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4047.58s)]
*  It's virtual perfection. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4049.86s)]
*  What's the explanation for this that modern archaeologists use? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4053.18s)]
*  They did it by hand, right? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4057.7799999999997s)]
*  That's what they claim. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4058.7799999999997s)]
*  They do it by hand. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4059.7799999999997s)]
*  That's literally what they say. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4060.7799999999997s)]
*  They're not engineers and construction experts at the end of the day. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4061.7799999999997s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4065.22s)]
*  It's very difficult to engage them on those specific details. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4066.22s)]
*  I've taken many engineers, master stonemasons, stone carvers, construction guys, and a lot [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4069.98s)]
*  of them see it immediately. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4077.3399999999997s)]
*  takes to both work in this material and to work at the scale that some of this stuff [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4079.78s)]
*  is worked in. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4084.2200000000003s)]
*  They see it immediately, and they just dismiss the idea that this was done with literally [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4085.5800000000004s)]
*  pounding stones and copper chisels. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4089.3s)]
*  It's a funny thing. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4093.1800000000003s)]
*  They insist those things are how they were done, but not once. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4094.34s)]
*  No one ever has cut a single big slab of granite the size of a refrigerator in half. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4097.780000000001s)]
*  We've never gone that far. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4102.66s)]
*  No one's demonstrated that, yep, you can take a copper bar and sand and grind your [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4104.5s)]
*  way through a refrigerator-sized block. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4109.02s)]
*  You're saying copper because we think that they didn't have steel back then. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4111.58s)]
*  They didn't. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4114.74s)]
*  Well, yeah, they didn't, and not until later. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4115.74s)]
*  There's no evidence for it. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4118.3s)]
*  There's evidence for copper and bronze. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4119.34s)]
*  There's no evidence for it when we're talking about 2500 BC. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4121.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4124.38s)]
*  Now, if there was some sort of very sophisticated civilization that was tens of thousands of [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4125.38s)]
*  years before that, and they were wiped out, and then you're leaving behind these artifacts [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4130.62s)]
*  and then people are claiming them as their own and then trying to copy them. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4137.46s)]
*  Imitation was a huge part of it, and we even see that. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4143.3s)]
*  You go to the Egyptian Museum and there's these beautiful igneous stone vases made of [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4145.78s)]
*  granite, and right next to them, on the same display, because they're found in the same [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4151.34s)]
*  pottery vase that's not even turned, just put together by hand, and they've painted [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4156.78s)]
*  it with dots to make it look like granite, and it's shaped the same way as the granite [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4161.34s)]
*  vase. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4164.34s)]
*  It's like that's pure imitation, like this here. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4165.34s)]
*  I love this. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4167.0599999999995s)]
*  This is one of my favorite examples, and this is like either first dynasty or pre-dynastic. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4168.259999999999s)]
*  But yeah, you have a hard igneous stone vessel made with perfection, and right next to what's [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4172.94s)]
*  clearly an imitation of it made from pottery, and they've even dotted it up to make it look [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4177.62s)]
*  like granite. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4180.9s)]
*  All the most sophisticated artifacts, pyramids, everything, are all the oldest. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4182.5s)]
*  It gets worse as it goes on, and that's not supposed to make sense. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4186.58s)]
*  When last time I was on with you, Joe, I was trying to articulate a point, which was that [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4191.58s)]
*  there was a Middle Kingdom, there was the First Kingdom, and there was these periods [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4194.18s)]
*  of revolt and revolution and missing history within Egypt, and there was three different [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4200.38s)]
*  kingdoms, and one of which was 126 years of lost history, another was over 200 years. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4204.12s)]
*  The one point to mention about that is that that means that whoever took over and reestablished [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4210.3s)]
*  themselves, there's now no one alive at that period of time that was around prior to whatever [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4214.42s)]
*  it is that reset them, that government or whatever they were. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4220.38s)]
*  If there's 126 years of lost history, no one is now alive to say what was what before that [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4224.54s)]
*  year one of 126 years, if that makes sense. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4230.34s)]
*  It's 3,000 years. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4234.58s)]
*  The dynastic Egyptian civilization itself is 3,000 years old. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4235.74s)]
*  They do trace that back, 30 plus thousand years. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4239.9s)]
*  They describe a time, Zeptepe, when the gods walked the earth. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4242.5s)]
*  They literally talk about these magical abilities that you could interpret as technology, and [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4246.099999999999s)]
*  then after that there was the Shemsu-Hor, the followers of Horus, these semi-divine mystical [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4251.0599999999995s)]
*  beings, and they have a list of kings and rulers that go back into that time. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4255.219999999999s)]
*  It's only in our interpretation and our archaeologists that really say, well, you know what, that's [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4260.339999999999s)]
*  just myth and legend, and after that, you know, we start dynasty one, king one. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4264.0599999999995s)]
*  That's actually history. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4270.0199999999995s)]
*  But what is their justification? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4271.0199999999995s)]
*  Why do they say that it's just myth and legend? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4272.9s)]
*  Where are they getting this information from? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4274.94s)]
*  Why are they making these assertions? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4277.139999999999s)]
*  Civilization can't exist until 6,000 years ago. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4279.78s)]
*  It says it right here, Joe. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4281.34s)]
*  Memorize it. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4282.58s)]
*  But once they see Gobekli Tepe, don't they kind of have to re-formulate? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4283.58s)]
*  They should. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4288.46s)]
*  They haven't done it. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4289.46s)]
*  They refuse. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4290.46s)]
*  They say they're primitive. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4291.46s)]
*  They say Gobekli Tepe was created by ... They changed it, and it literally happened. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4292.46s)]
*  I saw this argument being made when Michael Schoen was here with Graham and Randall. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4295.54s)]
*  They say it's made by hunter-gatherers. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4300.5s)]
*  They literally changed the definition of what it means to be a hunter-gatherer rather than [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4302.18s)]
*  move that precious date of civilization starting from 6,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago with [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4306.9s)]
*  Gobekli Tepe. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4312.42s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4313.94s)]
*  Gobekli Tepe, you cannot produce that type of installation without civilization. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4315.02s)]
*  So many things. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4323.1s)]
*  The specialization of allowing someone to be able to carve 18-foot pillars that weigh [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4324.1s)]
*  several tons with high relief. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4328.700000000001s)]
*  Not just that, but the fact that these animals on those pillars are 3D. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4329.700000000001s)]
*  You carve out the stone to remove stone so that you have these giant pillars with a lizard [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4335.02s)]
*  crawling up the side of it, but the lizard extends out from the stone. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4342.1s)]
*  High relief. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4346.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's not carved into it. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4347.660000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's just insane. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4348.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, as difficult as possible. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4349.660000000001s)]
*  You need a population base to support the development of specialization like that. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4352.54s)]
*  To me, it's as if they just think, well, no, these hunter-gatherers, these dudes just want [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4357.5s)]
*  to get around the weekends, get away from the women, go and do some rock carving project [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4360.54s)]
*  on the weekend. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4365.02s)]
*  We'll move some stones over here. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4366.02s)]
*  And it's not just stone circles. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4367.02s)]
*  There's buildings and cisterns and quarries. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4368.46s)]
*  There's infrastructure at these sites as well. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4371.06s)]
*  And they're finding more and more of them in Turkey. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4373.38s)]
*  The fact that it all goes back to that date is just like, look, we should be shifting [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4376.1s)]
*  the date of civilization back. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4379.9s)]
*  We've shifted back our date as a species. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4381.24s)]
*  I mean, fossil record, we were 190,000 years old forever. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4383.5199999999995s)]
*  They found a human jawbone in Morocco. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4387.88s)]
*  Now we're 300,000 years old. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4389.8s)]
*  The latest DNA evidence looking at our divergence from a common ancestor with the Neanderthals [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4391.48s)]
*  and studies on teeth morphology put us at around 800 to 900,000 years old, potentially. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4398.12s)]
*  That's the range of us as being sitting around here as modern humans on the planet. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4405.719999999999s)]
*  So much time. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4410.12s)]
*  Dude, it goes back to other periods. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4411.4800000000005s)]
*  You think about it like that's into other periods of warm, more hospitable environments. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4413.56s)]
*  Like it's beyond, you go through a couple of different glaciation cycles in that timeframe. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4419.32s)]
*  And give us a few warm sunny days and enough shit to eat and we're going to solve some [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4424.64s)]
*  friggin problems. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4427.88s)]
*  Yeah, especially for thousands of years. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4428.88s)]
*  Something wild about Gobekli Tepe, how many of those pillars are still buried and not [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4432.08s)]
*  excavated yet? [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4435.68s)]
*  Almost 200? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4436.68s)]
*  It's like 5% of it's been excavated. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4437.68s)]
*  And they found it by accident in the 90s. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4439.64s)]
*  They did. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4441.96s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4442.96s)]
*  Like, wasn't it a sheep herder? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4443.96s)]
*  Yep. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4445.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's a pot-bellied hill. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4446.96s)]
*  Yeah, he found something sticking out of the ground. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4447.96s)]
*  What's this? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4449.68s)]
*  Let me kick the dirt away from this thing. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4450.68s)]
*  And then what the fuck? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4452.52s)]
*  You find 12,000 year old massive stone structures that predate what we think of as history by [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4455.280000000001s)]
*  6,000 years. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4462.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4464.76s)]
*  And it's just finding more and more of it. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4466.6s)]
*  You know, it's funny, Jimmy, you mentioned about an interesting point about the sediment, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4469.92s)]
*  because I know, and Graham Hancock likes to talk about this too, underwater archaeology, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4472.5199999999995s)]
*  the fact that sea levels have risen 300 to 400 feet. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4475.96s)]
*  One of the challenges with that is exactly that, is that this catastrophic flooding that [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4479.08s)]
*  happened as a result of this violent process that got us to our climate of today and our [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4482.86s)]
*  sea level, is that yeah, there's sediment everywhere. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4487.24s)]
*  So even if there were cities, there were remains, the Younger Dryas and the Cataclysm was so [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4490.2s)]
*  violent and such a savage event that it would have just smashed stuff. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4496.04s)]
*  And even if there was stuff that's now underwater, it's like buried in sediment. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4499.8s)]
*  It's not like you're going to just take pictures of the ocean floor around these continents [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4502.96s)]
*  and find lost cities. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4506.36s)]
*  In a lot of places, this is all going to be buried in sediment and smashed into bits. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4508.76s)]
*  Yeah, gravel. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4512.0s)]
*  Just complete smithereens. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4513.0s)]
*  But they should go looking. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4514.0s)]
*  They should go looking, but I mean, just knowing the geological data, knowing that the Younger [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4516.6s)]
*  Dryas impact theory appears to be correct, knowing that there's people like Randall [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4524.28s)]
*  Carlson who have looked at the surface area of North America and shown these incredible [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4529.639999999999s)]
*  pieces of evidence that there's massive water flooding that went through, impossible to [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4539.679999999999s)]
*  understand. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4545.679999999999s)]
*  Like you can't comprehend the amount of water and the amount of power that would come from [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4546.679999999999s)]
*  that water and just from being impacted by a mile wide chunk of iron that slams into [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4553.5599999999995s)]
*  an ice cap. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4559.719999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4561.599999999999s)]
*  The channeled scablands is absolutely spectacular. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4562.599999999999s)]
*  I've done those trips with Randall a bunch of times. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4565.04s)]
*  It's such an incredible landscape when you put it in that context and you're looking [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4567.4s)]
*  at this outflow from these floods like we've never... [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4571.44s)]
*  It's these massive big coolies that are 800 foot high and you're standing on top of about [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4575.2s)]
*  of sediment to the bottom and it's just ripped all this basalt out and then dumped it out [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4579.719999999999s)]
*  into this massive big boulder spree that's also several hundred foot deep and you've [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4584.36s)]
*  got granite from Canada that's been carried by these floods down here and deposited in [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4588.16s)]
*  these giant icebergs. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4592.44s)]
*  And happened over a couple of days. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4593.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, maybe up to a week, but yeah, I really think he's onto something with the major flood. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4595.32s)]
*  There's so many problems with the Missoula flood, the main theory of lots of little floods [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4602.2s)]
*  that this ice dam reformed and it's a good topic for Randall. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4606.64s)]
*  But yeah, I think it definitely it happened in a real short time because that whole Lake [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4609.72s)]
*  Missoula area where they say was the reformation of an ice dam, that's what they say. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4614.360000000001s)]
*  It's like, well, this reformed like 95 times and these floods happened. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4619.0s)]
*  We have no evidence for that and there's nothing that ever supports that theory, least of all [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4623.360000000001s)]
*  hydrodynamics of trying to form an ice dam that's like 2000 feet deep and six miles [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4627.120000000001s)]
*  wide. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4631.52s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4632.52s)]
*  Ice dams don't get that big. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4633.52s)]
*  It can't happen. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4635.080000000001s)]
*  And it makes sense if you think about the fact that they believe we got hit by these [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4636.92s)]
*  massive chunks of rock and ice and stone and iron from space. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4641.2s)]
*  Let me ask. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4647.599999999999s)]
*  43,000 miles an hour. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4648.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4650.4s)]
*  Boom. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4651.4s)]
*  Into two mile thick ice. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4652.4s)]
*  Two mile thick ice. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4654.4s)]
*  Have you let me ask you a question. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4655.4s)]
*  Have you heard of the Carolina Bays? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4656.4s)]
*  No. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4657.679999999999s)]
*  Okay, so this is this is a great one because this ties into that. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4658.679999999999s)]
*  And this is like one of those things that nobody knows about, but it's a feature that's [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4661.8s)]
*  everywhere. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4664.8s)]
*  If you search for Carolina Bays, Jamie, all up and down the East Coast, it's not just [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4666.360000000001s)]
*  the Carolina. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4670.2s)]
*  There are literally millions of these geological features. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4671.2s)]
*  They're literally bays. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4674.360000000001s)]
*  They're elliptical bays. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4676.12s)]
*  The whole landscape's littered with them. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4677.96s)]
*  We started to notice them with the advent of aerial photography. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4679.52s)]
*  And then when we started doing LiDAR flyovers, we start to see them under everything. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4682.04s)]
*  Millions of them. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4686.28s)]
*  We also, that's on the East Coast. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4687.28s)]
*  Then over on Missoula, we have what's called Missoula Rainwater Basins. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4688.72s)]
*  Again, millions of them. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4691.52s)]
*  All over the landscape. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4692.92s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4693.92s)]
*  It's Carolina Bays. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4695.04s)]
*  And they're everywhere. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4696.8s)]
*  They range in size from pretty small to pretty big, like miles in diameter. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4697.8s)]
*  And they're all elliptical. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4700.8s)]
*  They're all like a conic section. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4702.96s)]
*  Now what do they think? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4704.4800000000005s)]
*  Look at that LiDAR one. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4705.4800000000005s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4706.4800000000005s)]
*  What do they think these are? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4707.4800000000005s)]
*  So there's been some debate. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4708.4800000000005s)]
*  And one of the mainstream opinions is that they're, well, they're wind and sand. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4709.4800000000005s)]
*  Aeolian, lacustrine solution created. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4713.72s)]
*  None of the experiments along the lines of wind can back this up. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4718.56s)]
*  The interesting thing about these is that they're all oriented in a specific direction. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4722.44s)]
*  And what turns out is that there was a study done because a guy went and mapped out thousands [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4727.32s)]
*  of them and lined them up. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4732.16s)]
*  And it wasn't until he took into account the Coriolis effect, so the spin of the earth, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4734.0s)]
*  that all of a sudden all these lines, the orientation of these bays all lined up at [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4739.16s)]
*  around Saginaw Bay, which would have been buried in ice. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4743.32s)]
*  So here's the theory that comes out about the Carolina Bays is that there was a massive [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4747.5199999999995s)]
*  impact into the ice and it basically threw up splash damage of ice boulders the size [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4751.72s)]
*  of baseball stadiums on suborbital trajectories that then created this saturation bombardment [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4758.8s)]
*  and liquefaction of the entire East Coast and over there in Missoula of the entire land. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4765.76s)]
*  Like it's absolutely nuts. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4771.12s)]
*  And that image, Jamie, in that lower left hand, oh I have a laser pointer. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4772.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4776.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4777.72s)]
*  Jimmy can't get laser pointed. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4778.72s)]
*  I brought one. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4780.320000000001s)]
*  The gift that we'll keep on giving. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4782.32s)]
*  What do I have to do to get this? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4783.719999999999s)]
*  Just press that button. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4785.12s)]
*  Oh yeah, rip off that little plastic thing. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4786.12s)]
*  Rip out the... [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4787.12s)]
*  It's like a safety? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4788.12s)]
*  Oh no, not that. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4789.12s)]
*  Rip out the battery, the little color. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4790.12s)]
*  Here, you can use this one. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4791.12s)]
*  It's ready to go. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4792.12s)]
*  Okay, show me how to... [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4793.12s)]
*  I gotcha. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4794.12s)]
*  Okay, so this one right here. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4795.12s)]
*  Whoa, Jesus. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4797.12s)]
*  I know, crazy, right? [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4798.12s)]
*  Reflected back and went and shit out of it. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4799.12s)]
*  This is the real deal. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4801.12s)]
*  So is that what they look like in real life? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4802.4s)]
*  They're more elliptical than that in general, so if you look at the LiDAR imagery, but a [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4804.92s)]
*  lot of them, yeah. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4810.28s)]
*  They're overlapping as well. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4812.24s)]
*  I'm going to be shooting this thing at airplanes later. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4813.24s)]
*  I got one that's the best $18 I've ever spent on Amazon ever. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4816.24s)]
*  I got one that'll pop balloons. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4819.24s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4822.24s)]
*  So much. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4823.24s)]
*  Oh dude, I bought a pop of balloons. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4824.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4825.24s)]
*  It comes with a little case with safety goggles. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4826.24s)]
*  You got to put them on. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4828.24s)]
*  I learned so much from this show. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4829.24s)]
*  I learned so much. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4831.24s)]
*  I'll bring it. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4832.24s)]
*  So these are... [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4833.24s)]
*  What is that in real life? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4834.24s)]
*  Does it actually look like that? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4835.24s)]
*  It depends. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4837.24s)]
*  Some of them are just farmland. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4838.24s)]
*  Some of them are still lakes. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4839.24s)]
*  They have bodies of water in them. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4840.56s)]
*  They mostly show up with LiDAR. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4841.88s)]
*  Oh, look at this, Jamie. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4843.280000000001s)]
*  There are a few spots. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4844.96s)]
*  Look at this, Jamie's going to Google Earth. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4845.96s)]
*  You can see them on Google Earth. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4848.080000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's there right there? [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4850.4800000000005s)]
*  That's more of a natural lake, but they're literally everywhere and they overlap. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4852.280000000001s)]
*  The whole landscape's made up of them. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4856.120000000001s)]
*  Didn't they find most of them through LiDAR though? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4858.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, LiDAR. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4859.4400000000005s)]
*  So a lot of them under the sediment. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4860.4400000000005s)]
*  They started to see them with aerial photography, and then LiDAR, they just turned up everywhere. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4861.4400000000005s)]
*  Under farmland. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4864.64s)]
*  I wish if I could... [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4865.64s)]
*  I didn't send you the photos of the bays with LiDAR. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4866.64s)]
*  It's just the crazy story about their creation is that these are splash damage from a cosmic [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4870.44s)]
*  impact into the ice, and they think it may be related to the younger dry. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4875.24s)]
*  So one of the impacts into the ice kicks up massive ice boulders that are coming in at [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4878.4s)]
*  like six or seven kilometers per second that take seven or eight minutes of these ballistic [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4882.6s)]
*  trajectories to come down from Saginaw Bay and then just all over the East Coast and [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4888.5199999999995s)]
*  Missoula. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4894.28s)]
*  And it would have exterminated anything that lived there. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4895.28s)]
*  It literally liquefied the ground. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4897.72s)]
*  The ground would have... [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4899.36s)]
*  The earthquakes and the impacts would have turned the ground into quicksand. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4900.36s)]
*  Like we see in the aftermath of earthquakes, you have cars that are half buried in mud. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4905.08s)]
*  Like it literally liquefies the earth. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4909.32s)]
*  And it was just a saturation bombardment on the East Coast. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4911.48s)]
*  And it's people now just, you know, we play golf on them and it's all this stuff. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4914.22s)]
*  But it's a catastrophic landscape, the entire East Coast, which is likely off the coast [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4917.96s)]
*  as well. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4922.76s)]
*  So here, this image is what? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4923.76s)]
*  This is from South Carolina's government page talking about it. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4925.4s)]
*  You see their ellipse, they're elliptical, they all orient in a certain direction. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4929.320000000001s)]
*  And so the conventional explanation is wind? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4933.04s)]
*  Wind and basically water. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4936.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4938.4400000000005s)]
*  But it doesn't... [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4939.4400000000005s)]
*  None of the experiments make sense. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4940.4400000000005s)]
*  There's a guy on YouTube, Antonio Zamora, he's also written a paper on it and a couple [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4941.4400000000005s)]
*  of books. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4946.0s)]
*  But he shows that, yeah, there's always been a bit of debate about them. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4947.0s)]
*  But by far the best, I think, explanation for them is the ice boulder hypothesis. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4950.400000000001s)]
*  It's crazy to think about it. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4957.48s)]
*  Impact happens over here, eight, nine, ten minutes later, you just have this rain of [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4960.24s)]
*  just destruction coming from the sky that obliterates the entire coast of the United [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4964.44s)]
*  States. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4970.16s)]
*  That's what you'd expect if there's something that hit at a high speed and of course there'd [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4971.16s)]
*  be fallout. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4975.04s)]
*  Things would get sprayed about. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4976.04s)]
*  It would make sense to find that if the Younger Dryas climate impact hypothesis is true, there [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4977.04s)]
*  would be something like that. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4981.44s)]
*  They've done experiments. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4982.48s)]
*  So you shoot a bullet into ice at an angle and it shows the shattering of ice and the [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4983.839999999999s)]
*  orientation. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4990.44s)]
*  So we can step backwards from the bays and look at, okay, what's the energy required [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4991.44s)]
*  for the impact and at what angle was the impact coming in? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4995.639999999999s)]
*  And it's something like it would have been probably a mile wide impactor up at Saginaw [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=4998.599999999999s)]
*  Bay that might have ejected that much ice to do that. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5003.36s)]
*  We're so vulnerable. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5006.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5007.599999999999s)]
*  Cosmic shooting gallery. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5008.599999999999s)]
*  We are so vulnerable. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5009.599999999999s)]
*  And we like to think this is all permanent. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5010.599999999999s)]
*  When you think about how ridiculous human beings are, we spend most of our lives accumulating [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5013.6s)]
*  stuff, trying to get status, trying to fuck as many people as we can and get the biggest [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5017.8s)]
*  house and meanwhile there's rocks headed our way that are going 45,000 miles an hour that [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5023.96s)]
*  could exterminate 90% of the population instantaneously and completely erase every little bit of information [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5030.32s)]
*  we've ever accumulated. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5038.88s)]
*  All the knowledge, all of our history, all of our understanding of physics, mathematics, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5040.32s)]
*  the astronomy, everything. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5045.8s)]
*  Gone. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5047.8s)]
*  See ya. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5048.8s)]
*  Goodbye. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5049.8s)]
*  Welcome to being a fucking ape man again. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5050.8s)]
*  Welcome to like eating whatever the fuck you can get in your mouth and dying when you're [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5053.24s)]
*  12. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5057.16s)]
*  And having people try to steal all that from you. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5058.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5060.72s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5061.72s)]
*  And within like what, like three, four generations, people would be, this is what I love, the [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5062.72s)]
*  ancient Egypt analysis. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5066.16s)]
*  We would be probably hammering a black rock into a shape like this, like a phone and dancing [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5067.56s)]
*  around a cave, a fire, trying to turn it on. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5072.240000000001s)]
*  Like if we dance around a fire hard enough, then this black rock will turn on and it'll [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5075.080000000001s)]
*  give me the fucking answer to anything I want. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5078.0s)]
*  Like it's just, we'd be talking about plasma TVs like it's a legend in the past. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5080.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, we would have no evidence of any of this stuff. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5084.52s)]
*  And one of the weirder things about us is we insist on putting our stuff on hard drives. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5087.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh God. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5091.52s)]
*  Right? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5092.52s)]
*  Which is the absolute worst thing. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5093.52s)]
*  And then there was the Georgia Guidestones. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5094.72s)]
*  People like, well, let's blow that shit up. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5096.4800000000005s)]
*  Somebody blew that up. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5098.76s)]
*  Something interesting. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5099.84s)]
*  They still haven't found anyone from that. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5100.84s)]
*  I find that quite interesting that they called it an act of domestic terrorism. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5102.6s)]
*  I mean, exploded ordinance on government land or as public as ran by the state, but they [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5106.4800000000005s)]
*  don't have anyone. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5113.96s)]
*  They had a car drive right by it. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5114.96s)]
*  They have no suspects. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5115.96s)]
*  I find that really peculiar because there was supposed to be that buried time capsule. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5117.92s)]
*  Well, they allegedly dug it up and there was nothing there. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5122.76s)]
*  I find that interesting. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5125.76s)]
*  What's your crazy tin foil hat conspiracy theory? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5127.76s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5130.6s)]
*  It was so this is this is complicated. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5131.88s)]
*  Who made the Georgia Guidestones, by the way? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5134.28s)]
*  Do we know that? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5136.28s)]
*  Some of it's a mystery. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5137.28s)]
*  Some of it we know. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5138.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5139.28s)]
*  It was it was a gentleman. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5140.28s)]
*  I made a video about this RC Christian and there was a small group of donors and they [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5142.04s)]
*  had had these written essentially laws for if like in the event of a cataclysm in human [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5147.2s)]
*  history was to be reset and this would be a guidance for how we should proceed. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5153.36s)]
*  And some people consider it to be very benign. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5157.8s)]
*  I don't I wasn't a big fan of them because it basically preaches I would say communism. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5160.32s)]
*  It talks about having population control as far as not allowing that there should be societal [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5166.5199999999995s)]
*  pressure as well as legal pressure on controlling how many kids people have moving forward and [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5172.839999999999s)]
*  to keep a balance at five hundred million. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5178.599999999999s)]
*  They don't say reduce the population to five hundred million. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5180.599999999999s)]
*  That's where some of the conspiracies come in is that this is a depopulation agenda. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5182.799999999999s)]
*  But the conspiracy to answer your question, some people suspect that what if because there's [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5186.08s)]
*  a lot of talk today about people wanting to reduce population and we're destroying the [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5191.4s)]
*  earth that what if the powers that be that did create them purposely if they're if they're [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5195.36s)]
*  under that way if they're under their plan, they'd want to destroy them, remove that evidence [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5200.96s)]
*  and pretend those guided stones didn't even exist in the first place and remove that that [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5205.04s)]
*  time capsule. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5209.52s)]
*  This is complete conspiracy. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5210.52s)]
*  I don't know what I'm talking about. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5211.52s)]
*  But what I do find interesting is that the car. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5212.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5215.88s)]
*  Here's the most bizarre thing of this whole thing. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5216.88s)]
*  The charge they destroyed. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5218.88s)]
*  So as you can see, they cause significant damage. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5221.320000000001s)]
*  But the very next day, less than 24 hours after this bomb went off, they they leveled [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5224.24s)]
*  it. They raised it to the ground because they said it was a safety hazard. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5230.28s)]
*  But I'm like, this is the middle of a field. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5232.84s)]
*  They can cordon off with police crime scene tape and just be an Iraq veteran. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5234.16s)]
*  Like when there was an idea to go off, they'd have people come out and investigate this [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5237.76s)]
*  into an investigation. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5241.04s)]
*  This was a bomb on on the on United States ground. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5242.36s)]
*  And they leveled it the next day. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5247.12s)]
*  And I'm like, where's all the forensic teams coming in to try and analyze the explosive [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5248.639999999999s)]
*  evidence? It just seemed really, really they urgently removed all evidence of this. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5253.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's the part that makes my little conspiracy wheels go is because, you know, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5258.84s)]
*  where's the true investigation? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5263.64s)]
*  Where's the FBI? Where's the ATF? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5265.16s)]
*  Again, less than a day after that bomb went off, they raised it to the ground and nothing [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5267.400000000001s)]
*  since. I mean, how have they not found this person? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5272.360000000001s)]
*  Why would they raise it to the ground? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5275.24s)]
*  Why wouldn't they just fix it? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5276.64s)]
*  Or maybe it wasn't salvageable. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5278.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know. What I do know is that they quickly remove that thing. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5280.4400000000005s)]
*  And I just that just that's just a little bit weird. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5284.320000000001s)]
*  Why would you do that? Where's the ATF? [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5286.68s)]
*  Where's all the people out there taking swabs of everything? [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5288.96s)]
*  You know, if there was a natural disaster that was imminent and it was headed our way [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5291.400000000001s)]
*  and only a few people knew about it, how much do you think they'd tell us? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5296.4400000000005s)]
*  They wouldn't. Yeah. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5299.92s)]
*  Yeah. I don't say a goddamn thing because we would go crazy. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5300.84s)]
*  We'd wind up looting all the targets. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5303.6s)]
*  That's right. Targeting Walmart. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5305.24s)]
*  I'm going to last game. Starbucks. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5309.8s)]
*  Real quick. Did you hear what Elon Musk said on the Full Send podcast a few months ago? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5312.04s)]
*  What? So there's Full Send, the Nelk Boys. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5318.0s)]
*  Awesome guys. Great podcast. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5320.84s)]
*  Elon Musk was on there. It's like four months ago. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5322.92s)]
*  It's like 15 million views. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5324.6s)]
*  So three hour podcast. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5326.2s)]
*  And at two hours and like 53 minutes, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5327.4400000000005s)]
*  they start talking about cataclysms and ice ages. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5330.320000000001s)]
*  And Elon Musk, this is out of all things that were discussed on the podcast. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5333.12s)]
*  In my mind, the most interesting part of it all got zero coverage. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5337.04s)]
*  It's like nobody talked about it. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5340.320000000001s)]
*  And it's because it's two hours and 50 minutes in. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5341.28s)]
*  But Elon Musk says a couple of things within just a few minutes. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5344.0s)]
*  He says, if you want to go down a deep, deep rabbit hole, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5346.64s)]
*  look into ice ages and how often they happen. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5350.4800000000005s)]
*  He goes on to say that if you listen to this, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5353.160000000001s)]
*  if you read about ice ages. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5356.8s)]
*  Yeah. Really? Like a deep rabbit hole on ice ages. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5359.04s)]
*  What's so intriguing about them? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5362.280000000001s)]
*  The whole earth has just been through like the whole earth is just freezing. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5363.6s)]
*  Like I said, this deep rabbit hole on ice ages, deep rabbit hole. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5368.160000000001s)]
*  Where should we go? So many. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5372.160000000001s)]
*  Wait, there's so many. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5374.6s)]
*  Wikipedia or some kind of a candidate. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5375.56s)]
*  It was like a little bit of a tidbit of it. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5377.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Why do you love it? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5379.96s)]
*  Why do I love it? I mean, I think it's just interesting. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5381.400000000001s)]
*  So interesting. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5383.8s)]
*  That's how much climate has changed and even where the where the [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5384.68s)]
*  magnetically where the poles are has shifted over time. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5389.200000000001s)]
*  So. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5393.240000000001s)]
*  You know, anyway, there's. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5397.6s)]
*  There's also been times where. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5400.360000000001s)]
*  In the past, where our galaxy is like collided with another galaxy [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5403.16s)]
*  that probably, you know, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5407.88s)]
*  threw things for a bit of a loop at the time. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5409.92s)]
*  Was there a conspiracy when it comes to ice ages or anything like that? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5411.96s)]
*  Or is not really. No. OK. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5414.84s)]
*  When was the last ice age? How long ago was that? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5416.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, we're technically in [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5419.84s)]
*  sort of an ice age right now, although it turns out what you call an ice age. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5423.84s)]
*  What happened to global warming? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5428.0s)]
*  Yeah. How so? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5429.32s)]
*  What defines an ice age at that? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5431.24s)]
*  Global warming is not cool anymore. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5432.44s)]
*  But it's a deep rabbit hole. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5434.12s)]
*  What do you do when you go down a deep rabbit hole, though? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5437.44s)]
*  Is it YouTube videos, books or how do you educate? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5439.5599999999995s)]
*  Internet and books and clicking around the Internet, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5443.4s)]
*  Googling Wikipedia, you know, YouTube, whatever. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5447.32s)]
*  So. Twitter can be interesting. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5450.839999999999s)]
*  So. I think there was probably something [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5455.0s)]
*  significant that happened at the in the last ice age [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5459.68s)]
*  because we don't see any evidence of writing. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5464.5599999999995s)]
*  I want to say I'm using ice age in the colloquial term [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5467.88s)]
*  of like when when was it very snowy [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5471.48s)]
*  and where the glaciers came down far and where summer was short, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5475.08s)]
*  winter was very long. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5479.68s)]
*  And that was about 10,000 years ago. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5481.72s)]
*  So. Something happened [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5485.08s)]
*  around, I think, around that ice age that because we see no writing. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5488.68s)]
*  How do you know writing before that ice age? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5494.04s)]
*  And we start to see writing pop up in multiple places on Earth [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5495.92s)]
*  after that, after the most recent colloquially termed ice age. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5500.08s)]
*  So, you know, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5506.360000000001s)]
*  like I said, there have been times when. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5510.360000000001s)]
*  Earth has been extremely tropical and where it's been a snowball. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5513.04s)]
*  But these these tend to occur over very long periods of time. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5517.4s)]
*  The global warming thing we're talking about here. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5521.48s)]
*  That's about it. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5523.799999999999s)]
*  He knows for such an unbelievably smart individual [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5524.799999999999s)]
*  and as rich and powerful as he is, I look at these topics that we're into. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5528.799999999999s)]
*  Cataclysms, younger, driest, lost ancient technology. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5532.679999999999s)]
*  Magnetic poles. That's the one thing that I would like to dive into that. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5536.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I watched a video on that this morning. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5540.2s)]
*  The Adam and Eve video. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5543.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The G.N. Thomas thing. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5545.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. That's an interesting one. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5546.28s)]
*  Is that how much of that is [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5549.04s)]
*  agreed upon that there could be a time [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5553.4800000000005s)]
*  where the magnetic poles actually shift? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5556.6s)]
*  So this is science. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5558.96s)]
*  They say that the last one was like seven hundred and seventy eight thousand [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5561.2s)]
*  years ago and were more there were like something like two hundred [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5564.12s)]
*  thousand years overdue. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5566.2s)]
*  But the Adam and Eve story, the theory of that is that these [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5568.16s)]
*  it happens in cycles of sixty five hundred years and that it's a ninety degree [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5571.32s)]
*  flip. But six days later or on the seventh day, it corrects itself. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5575.36s)]
*  The planet flips. Not just that. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5579.56s)]
*  Correct. It's a planet flip. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5581.68s)]
*  Ninety degree. And that because of it, the earth essentially does a standstill. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5583.32s)]
*  The sun will be direct. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5587.52s)]
*  Will basically stay in the same spot, causing heating like we've never experienced. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5588.96s)]
*  And that the wind and the waters continue with their momentum [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5593.96s)]
*  because essentially the wind travels at approximately a thousand miles an hour [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5597.599999999999s)]
*  at the equator. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5601.32s)]
*  So the theory is that when that event happens, it's going to be cataclysmic. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5602.28s)]
*  And here's the wild thing is that in that document, it says [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5606.48s)]
*  a continental sized tsunami being two miles high. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5610.2s)]
*  Well, I showed you the Emikusi volcano in Africa and the Sahara, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5613.28s)]
*  which is at eleven thousand three hundred feet, that has salt as well [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5617.28s)]
*  as evidence of gastropods sea life. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5620.599999999999s)]
*  Two miles high. Yes. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5622.5199999999995s)]
*  And I'm like, it's just it would make a lot of sense. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5624.16s)]
*  Like if you look at the Bible and involving like revelations [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5626.56s)]
*  and it's saying like six days on the seventh day, God rested. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5629.04s)]
*  And that document, it says six days things start simmering down a bit. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5632.56s)]
*  And, you know, by day seven, things are starting over new. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5636.320000000001s)]
*  So what's the science behind this complete reversal of the magnetic pole? [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5639.84s)]
*  So real quick, this is the I the part that sets me off about this [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5645.0s)]
*  is that any article you ever read on this and makes it crystal clear [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5648.72s)]
*  that this will not be apocalyptic. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5652.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe we'll have some. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5655.280000000001s)]
*  No, we'll potentially have some satellite communication issues [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5656.400000000001s)]
*  that could affect our power grid and telecommunication systems. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5658.76s)]
*  And that's going to be unfortunate. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5661.320000000001s)]
*  But don't worry, it's not a doomsday. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5662.68s)]
*  I'm like, OK, first of all, if the grid goes down, that is doomsday. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5664.200000000001s)]
*  But number two, they don't know what they're talking about [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5667.64s)]
*  because they claim that the geo magnetic pole shift is because of the interior, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5670.4400000000005s)]
*  whether it's iron core or whatever it is, the molten core does a shift. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5675.92s)]
*  And because of it, that's why the compass will flip. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5679.240000000001s)]
*  But I'm like, if you look at the nature of earthquakes, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5682.5599999999995s)]
*  they some originate in the crust, others originate in the mantle, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5685.4s)]
*  in the in the parts that are that aren't solid. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5689.36s)]
*  So I'm like, if you're saying that the interior that is molten does a shift, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5691.48s)]
*  why on earth would you suggest that it wouldn't cause earthquakes [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5696.759999999999s)]
*  or volcanic activity on the surface? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5700.44s)]
*  So I feel like the every article I ever read on geomagnetic pole shifts, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5703.4s)]
*  they go out of their way to say, don't worry, it's fine. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5707.679999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, but yet the evidence shows that it's accelerating. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5710.48s)]
*  Back in just the 1990s, it was traveling the pole. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5714.12s)]
*  The North Pole was transitioning at 10 miles a year. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5717.599999999999s)]
*  Now it's at 40 or almost 40 miles. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5720.16s)]
*  It's accelerating. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5722.5599999999995s)]
*  And then Adam and Eve story, it talks about actually not the Adam story. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5723.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a documentary on Nova years ago that the evidence shows that when you've [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5726.599999999999s)]
*  studied all the other volcanic rock for prior known pole shifts, [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5730.0s)]
*  because keep in mind, there's hundreds that are known. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5734.12s)]
*  This has happened throughout millions and millions of years. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5736.0s)]
*  This is mainstream science. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5738.08s)]
*  The poles do flip. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5739.48s)]
*  They but it's not that the earth flips over. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5741.0s)]
*  It's that the inside core does. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5743.719999999999s)]
*  And so your magnetic compass will flip like what causes it. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5745.36s)]
*  So the whatever that molten core is, it does a shift inside. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5749.04s)]
*  It allegedly happens in cycles and we're long overdue. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5752.36s)]
*  And when it happens, the other theory is that the earth's shields will be diminished. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5756.24s)]
*  Well, definitely. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5761.16s)]
*  So the magnet, we know two things right now is that the pole is moving. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5761.96s)]
*  So it's off. I think it's it's off. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5766.04s)]
*  Even the South Pole might be off of Antarctica at this point, the magnetic south. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5767.88s)]
*  And then the magnetic field consequently to this movement is weakening. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5771.96s)]
*  So we know our magnetic field. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5775.16s)]
*  And that's where a lot of that danger is going to come from, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5776.4800000000005s)]
*  is if the magnetic field keeps weakening now, everything cosmically that happens [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5779.08s)]
*  is going to hit the earth and particularly us with our electronics. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5783.28s)]
*  It's all going to get [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5786.76s)]
*  more easily smashed because the magnetic field is what protects us from solar [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5789.04s)]
*  flares and cosmic radiation and all this stuff. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5792.04s)]
*  So as as as the field and the acceleration of that weakening, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5794.56s)]
*  of the field, sorry, is accelerating. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5797.88s)]
*  So it's it's getting it's getting weaker, faster. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5799.52s)]
*  So we seem to be heading towards an unknown or undetermined time [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5802.92s)]
*  where the poles may shift like the polarity of the the earth will shift. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5806.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And the compass. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5810.52s)]
*  And are there any estimates on when this could possibly take place? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5811.2s)]
*  According to every article I ever read, look, oh, don't worry. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5815.76s)]
*  It's probably another thousand years. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5818.08s)]
*  I mean, you have no idea what you're talking about. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5819.36s)]
*  It's accelerating. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5821.84s)]
*  And if you look, there's a there you don't have to Google this, Jamie. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5822.72s)]
*  I don't know what the there's a mountain chain in eastern Oregon. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5825.32s)]
*  Where is the evidence of a pole shift that there was [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5828.04s)]
*  a volcano that was active during the shift. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5831.8s)]
*  And if you take a compass along the the volcanic rock, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5834.2s)]
*  the compass will slowly start to change. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5838.64s)]
*  And so wherever like pottery or volcanic rock solidifies that [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5840.4800000000005s)]
*  wherever the North Pole is at that time, [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5844.64s)]
*  it's an imprint and the compass will continue to show that. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5846.88s)]
*  It's really fun. Take a compass around volcanic rock and it'll [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5849.8s)]
*  it'll move the compass to wherever the North Pole was then. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5852.36s)]
*  But here's the interesting part is that what it shows is that the [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5855.8s)]
*  pole shift starts slow and then they accelerate to the point where [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5858.96s)]
*  the day that it happens, you could potentially see the compass slowly moving. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5863.84s)]
*  And then when you go back to this Adam and Eve story [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5868.8s)]
*  talking about the pole shift, they say that the event happens [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5870.6s)]
*  in approximately a quarter of a day, so six hours. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5872.72s)]
*  So it's like it starts it comes out of nowhere. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5875.52s)]
*  And I'm like, what if like I'm into the cosmic impact that [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5877.360000000001s)]
*  there's unbelievable evidence that definitely happened. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5880.68s)]
*  But there's other things that happen on Earth, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5883.080000000001s)]
*  whether it's super volcanoes, what if that's related to pole shifts as well? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5884.52s)]
*  And the reason why the evidence wouldn't be necessarily that we couldn't find it [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5888.280000000001s)]
*  is because if the Adam and Eve story, if the if the details discussed in it [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5892.52s)]
*  are accurate, the reason why we're not seeing the evidence of it [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5895.56s)]
*  is because it flips right back and thus masks the evidence that had ever happened. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5898.280000000001s)]
*  So it's pretty wild. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5904.360000000001s)]
*  You guys are freaking me the fuck out, man. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5905.160000000001s)]
*  Can you text Elon real quick? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5907.120000000001s)]
*  He knows he talks about no writing before ten thousand years [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5909.120000000001s)]
*  and he's saying it afterwards and he's talking about deep, deep rabbit hole. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5912.28s)]
*  I listen to what he says. He's careful with his words. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5915.5199999999995s)]
*  And I mean, since we know there's been five interglacial periods [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5917.92s)]
*  over the last four hundred and fifty thousand years, this is the topic. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5921.44s)]
*  You want to see something else? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5925.12s)]
*  Donald President Trump said it, too. What did he say? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5926.679999999999s)]
*  He was I have the I have the video on my my laptop. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5929.24s)]
*  It's only 30 seconds long. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5932.28s)]
*  If you YouTube Donald Trump on climate, climate scientists, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5933.5199999999995s)]
*  basically they're talking about global warming. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5938.2s)]
*  And he says he basically interrupts and says, it's going to cool first, though, isn't it? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5940.639999999999s)]
*  And the scientists like, oh, that's not what the evidence shows. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5945.08s)]
*  And he starts he kind of laughs. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5947.639999999999s)]
*  He goes, I'm not so sure you know that. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5948.84s)]
*  And I'm like, of course he would know people don't Trump's anti-Syrian. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5951.719999999999s)]
*  He's stupid. I'm like, he didn't just pull that out of his ass. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5955.679999999999s)]
*  He was saying when he was the president. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5958.599999999999s)]
*  Yes, this was just a few years ago. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5960.32s)]
*  This is probably his last year of his term. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5961.8s)]
*  It's I had I have the clip on my laptop. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5964.639999999999s)]
*  It's a 30 second clip or maybe 20 seconds. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5966.5599999999995s)]
*  He said it's going to cool first, though, before, isn't it? [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5968.8s)]
*  And I'm like, I look at what Musk is saying and this evidence of the poll shift. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5971.72s)]
*  I think that the true data on Earth is that the Earth is cold most of the time, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5974.96s)]
*  that right now we should be grateful that it's nice and cozy [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5980.280000000001s)]
*  because we can live when it's warm. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5982.84s)]
*  But I think that the data might indicate that Earth is cold more often than it's hot. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5984.68s)]
*  Well, that's what Randall Carlson has said. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5989.64s)]
*  And what Randall Carlson said that really freaked me out, he goes, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5991.4400000000005s)]
*  global warming is not scary. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5994.8s)]
*  He goes global cooling is that's what's really scary. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=5996.88s)]
*  But we're so concerned with our own guilt and impact because of industrialized [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6000.400000000001s)]
*  society and what sort of, you know, impact we're having on the climate [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6005.92s)]
*  and the earth and our air. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6010.68s)]
*  And and then there's this narrative that just gets repeated over and over [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6012.64s)]
*  and over again, this fear mongering. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6017.56s)]
*  And everyone gets freaked out. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6019.8s)]
*  It's not to say that we aren't polluting. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6021.28s)]
*  We certainly are. Not to say that we shouldn't improve. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6023.04s)]
*  We certainly should. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6025.16s)]
*  But if the fucking magnetic poles might shift [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6026.32s)]
*  and we might get hit by a giant rock from space, we might have bigger problems. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6029.32s)]
*  Yeah. And we're going to be concentrating on nonsense, [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6033.28s)]
*  which is really par for the course with human beings. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6036.0s)]
*  We're going to be concentrating on these things that we're really not going to fix [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6040.0s)]
*  over the short term when something might happen that it makes all of it a moot point. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6043.4s)]
*  This is what the doomsday people say. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6049.48s)]
*  Were you going to say something? [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6051.16s)]
*  Yeah, I was just going to say like that's the analogy is a great one [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6052.12s)]
*  from my friend George Howard says it's like we're sitting in a car [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6055.2s)]
*  arguing about what what's what channel the radio is tuned to. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6058.08s)]
*  But the car sitting on a train track and the trains coming eventually. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6061.4s)]
*  Because the climate, the climate change that we're going to get from [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6064.6s)]
*  yet catastrophic impact or any of these other events [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6067.68s)]
*  that inject kind of energy in from the exterior system. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6071.84s)]
*  I mean, just all of this current discussion piles into nothingness. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6074.4s)]
*  And then there's super volcanoes to happen all the time. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6077.24s)]
*  What about Yellowstone? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6080.36s)]
*  Yellowstone's overdue. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6081.84s)]
*  Yellowstone is a continent killer. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6083.56s)]
*  I mean, we have no safeguards in place. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6086.160000000001s)]
*  There's no we're lucky that the last essentially 10,000 years [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6089.6s)]
*  with a couple of blips, things like Burkle Crater, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6093.56s)]
*  we've had really calm, pleasant weather for most of it. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6096.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's why our civilization has risen, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6099.0s)]
*  because if you look at the temperature record and the swings from cold [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6101.88s)]
*  to even colder and back again, I mean, it's it's up and down. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6105.64s)]
*  There was all sorts of nasty things happening, you know, more than 10,000 years ago. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6108.84s)]
*  And ever since then, it's this pretty straight line. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6112.72s)]
*  It's the reason that we're a civilization now. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6114.72s)]
*  And because we think in such short term timeframes, human lifetimes or, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6116.64s)]
*  you know, even just a couple of hundred years, we just ignore that stuff. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6120.96s)]
*  But if you extend the timeline out far enough, these things are going to happen again. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6124.12s)]
*  And we should probably be a bit more conscious of them. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6128.360000000001s)]
*  And yeah, that's that's the threat. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6131.240000000001s)]
*  Someone must know some if there's enough smart people, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6133.64s)]
*  they should be investigating this. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6136.96s)]
*  I'm like, what does Elon know? What do other people know? [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6138.2s)]
*  Some people speculate that the reason for such brazen [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6140.36s)]
*  poor behavior involving spending with the government and the economy [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6143.96s)]
*  and the US dollar and all these things like that's some speculate [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6146.92s)]
*  this totally conspiracy that like the powers that be know something's coming. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6149.96s)]
*  And so they're just going to keep things going until then. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6153.12s)]
*  Because the way things are being run does it makes no sense. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6156.5199999999995s)]
*  Like the world economic forum is taking place right now at Davos [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6159.4s)]
*  and Klaus Schwab and George Soros just pulled out of it. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6162.599999999999s)]
*  They did. What do you make of that? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6165.48s)]
*  They went to the bunker. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6167.04s)]
*  They dig in some pretty big holes in Colorado. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6169.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of bunkers in New Zealand, too, that are owned by billionaires. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6170.84s)]
*  So big holes in Colorado. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6173.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, that's that's also the Cheyenne Mountain. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6175.4s)]
*  And that's where all like the the nuclear command is and stuff. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6178.4800000000005s)]
*  And and they've they've been [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6181.08s)]
*  from from sources unknown. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6184.04s)]
*  I can also tell you that at some point they have I've seen [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6185.64s)]
*  I've eyeballed this like an an RFP request for proposal [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6189.16s)]
*  for people to develop basically drone systems, you know, that the movie Prometheus, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6193.12s)]
*  where they threw the drones up in the tunnels. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6197.76s)]
*  They there was an RFP for people to develop tech like that [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6199.84s)]
*  because the the government was interesting. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6202.84s)]
*  The premise was that they wanted to be able to fight in underground cities. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6205.360000000001s)]
*  Fight. Yeah. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6209.280000000001s)]
*  Like as in for the military, want to be able to map terrain [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6210.24s)]
*  and have these drones that can navigate in underground space without GPS [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6212.96s)]
*  and map the environment because it's the combat situation [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6216.72s)]
*  was fighting in underground cities. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6219.64s)]
*  Because there's going to be a small population of marauding people. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6220.92s)]
*  And there's very little resources. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6223.76s)]
*  And a small number of humans left alive and civilization [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6225.96s)]
*  will be thrown into chaos. Right. Fun. Yeah. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6229.88s)]
*  A good time. So much fun. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6232.92s)]
*  But let's argue about what gender you should use the restroom. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6234.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6237.32s)]
*  I'm sure there's people that exploring that premise, man. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6239.52s)]
*  They have to be, I think. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6241.72s)]
*  Smart people, top men, as they call it. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6242.8s)]
*  They must be looking into it. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6245.08s)]
*  And so like I brought up on the first time I was on with you. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6246.04s)]
*  And then Graham Hancock had a whole episode on it. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6248.4s)]
*  The Cappadocia, you know, underground cities. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6250.96s)]
*  There's many of them. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6253.24s)]
*  And a lot of them can support tens of thousands of people. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6254.84s)]
*  That almost to me looks like a doomsday bunker, like an ark of some kind. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6258.16s)]
*  Like they could hold house farm animals. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6262.24s)]
*  They connect to underground rivers that are 15 stories down. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6265.32s)]
*  That this was sophisticated. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6268.64s)]
*  And I'm like, that's underground rivers that are 15 stories down. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6270.08s)]
*  They dug right to them. And here's something else. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6273.76s)]
*  They say that there's zero evidence of any type of cave in. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6275.6s)]
*  So whoever carved this out of the limestone in there, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6278.64s)]
*  this was sophisticated. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6282.4400000000005s)]
*  Like they did so in a way that it didn't collapse in on itself. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6283.6s)]
*  And yet, and they also must have known that it reached a freshwater [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6286.6s)]
*  source of water down below. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6290.88s)]
*  So as long as it doesn't get hit directly, right. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6292.52s)]
*  Which you can never predict. Yeah. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6295.8s)]
*  You'd be screwed. Yeah. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6297.400000000001s)]
*  Which is where I'd want to be if it happens. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6298.64s)]
*  This is wild. Have it land on me. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6300.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Look at there's pictures that show images of it like underground. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6302.56s)]
*  Yeah, we've we've seen those before when Graham and Randall were on last. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6306.96s)]
*  We talked about these and that they probably used these for short periods [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6311.04s)]
*  of time, right post impact before they came back to the surface again. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6314.5199999999995s)]
*  So they weathered the storm and then came back above [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6319.16s)]
*  and that they had gotten accustomed to this. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6322.16s)]
*  Which is just really wild, man. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6325.12s)]
*  So this is in Colorado. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6327.84s)]
*  They're all over the place. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6331.32s)]
*  Jamie should Google the Cheyenne. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6332.48s)]
*  Do you want to live them? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6334.32s)]
*  If everything goes sideways completely back to caveman life, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6335.6s)]
*  do you really want to make it through that? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6339.8s)]
*  Yes, I've seen enough television shows and movies to know that it's a lot of fun. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6341.52s)]
*  I'm going to I'm a I'm a prepper. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6345.400000000001s)]
*  I have my I have my things in place to be safe. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6349.04s)]
*  And I would if if shit really hit the fan, I'd want to look after [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6351.92s)]
*  those who are still around, you know, like I don't know. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6355.0s)]
*  Maybe it'd be miserable. I'd be eaten alive by cannibals. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6357.52s)]
*  How many bullets do you have saved? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6360.16s)]
*  I won't answer that. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6361.52s)]
*  Ask me after the program. Plenty. OK. Plenty. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6362.88s)]
*  I was a soldier. All right. So you need thousands. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6365.400000000001s)]
*  Because it's a lot. Yeah. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6367.52s)]
*  Thousands. Because people don't realize you're like, oh, thousand rounds. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6368.92s)]
*  That's scary. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6372.0s)]
*  Like if you're just doing target practicing, you can go through 100 rounds in minutes. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6372.88s)]
*  So you would need a bunch. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6377.52s)]
*  And you'd want a variety of calibers. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6378.76s)]
*  And you'd want a bunch of each one of those calibers, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6380.92s)]
*  because if you get to a point where you run low, you want to be able to go [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6383.16s)]
*  scavenging and you would want a variety of weapons that can house different calibers. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6386.04s)]
*  You want a shotgun. You'd want the five, five, six. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6390.76s)]
*  You'd want probably a nine millimeter because it's the most abundant. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6393.2s)]
*  And Ruger 1022 long rifle. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6396.88s)]
*  You'd want it all. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6399.6s)]
*  The people coming at you, though, too, it's that that's the thing. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6401.72s)]
*  Like I've got a few acres and you run through the scenarios and stuff like that. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6404.04s)]
*  The people that are going to come at you from the cities and from those desolate [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6407.68s)]
*  areas, like they're the winners of that competition. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6410.72s)]
*  They're going to be the most savage, crazy MFs that have been eating everybody else [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6413.04s)]
*  and taking all their shit. So you just got to be. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6418.2s)]
*  And then how long before we start figuring out phones again after that? [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6420.44s)]
*  How many thousands of years for that's what's really crazy to think of. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6424.4800000000005s)]
*  If things get knocked into the Stone Age, like if you go back to the sophistication [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6428.04s)]
*  of ancient Egypt and you think about what the civilization could have been like, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6432.84s)]
*  I mean, you're just speculating, you're just trying to just imagine [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6437.92s)]
*  how they could have moved these five hundred ton stone blocks, five hundred miles. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6441.68s)]
*  You're putting all these things into your mind and then say, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6448.64s)]
*  how long does it take to get from that? [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6451.96s)]
*  If you knock back into barbarians, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6455.96s)]
*  how long does it take to get from that to where we are now? [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6458.72s)]
*  Well, evidence would suggest something like 6000 years, which is wild. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6462.4800000000005s)]
*  It is. You think about like, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6466.96s)]
*  but if you think about how absolutely fucking ruthless people were 2000 years ago, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6468.4800000000005s)]
*  doesn't it kind of make sense that those are the ones that made it through? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6472.88s)]
*  And then it took a long time for they calm the fuck down. Right. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6476.4800000000005s)]
*  So if you go back to whatever it was, [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6480.4s)]
*  the sophistication level that people were at when they built ancient Egypt, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6483.719999999999s)]
*  let's just speculate that it was 20000 years ago. Yeah. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6488.639999999999s)]
*  And you think about how much they had to endure to get to that point [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6491.5599999999995s)]
*  and how much they had to mean. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6496.639999999999s)]
*  There's there's real evidence, and if you especially pay attention [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6498.28s)]
*  to the work of people like Steven Pinker, that over time, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6500.759999999999s)]
*  there's been less violence, less, less crime, less everything. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6504.84s)]
*  Like civilization has gotten better. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6510.56s)]
*  We are calming down from now versus the way we were 2000 years ago, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6512.88s)]
*  1000 years ago, 500 years ago. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6519.0s)]
*  Things are moving in the correct direction. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6521.04s)]
*  But how long does it take before you have [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6523.0s)]
*  this level of sophistication that allows you to get to the pyramids? [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6529.04s)]
*  And then we're nowhere near that now. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6532.24s)]
*  So even on the most conservative speculation [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6535.08s)]
*  that the Great Pyramid is only 4500 years ago, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6539.5599999999995s)]
*  we're not even anywhere near that now. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6543.12s)]
*  We're nowhere near the level of sophistication that it took them to build. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6544.76s)]
*  And we're just guessing as to what kind of technology they had available to them. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6548.24s)]
*  And as you pointed out with these vases and with just the [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6552.16s)]
*  the alignment to the constellations, the sophistication that's involved [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6557.4s)]
*  in the construction to get stones that are tons of stone [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6561.52s)]
*  that you can't even get a razor blade in between. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6566.88s)]
*  Like what the fuck was going on? [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6568.76s)]
*  Here's the fun thing to entertain is about moving the stone. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6571.240000000001s)]
*  So all that black granite that came from 500 miles away. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6573.88s)]
*  Yeah. But the ones that came from the eastern part of Egypt. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6579.160000000001s)]
*  The Wadi Hammamit quarry that's in the east. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6582.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And the mountains in the mountains of nowhere near the Nile. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6584.320000000001s)]
*  Right. And so they would have had to have a ground. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6587.4400000000005s)]
*  You'd have to go up and down mountains to move these things. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6589.44s)]
*  There were tens of tons like off cliffs. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6591.88s)]
*  And because like the narrative is like, oh, well, they would have brought these [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6596.08s)]
*  stones up the Nile. Right. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6599.08s)]
*  Well, there's there's stones out there that are on the other side of the Nile [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6600.44s)]
*  in the mountains. So how did they bring those enormous stones? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6603.719999999999s)]
*  A huge. Well, there's thousand tons stone. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6608.5599999999995s)]
*  There is. So there's there's evidence is multiple statues that I can show you [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6610.599999999999s)]
*  the pictures of that there were single piece that you have the unfinished obelisk [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6615.76s)]
*  in the quarry. That's one thousand two hundred tons. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6620.96s)]
*  But then you have at least three or four [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6623.08s)]
*  unfit like finished statues that were a thousand tons, single piece granite. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6625.4400000000005s)]
*  And one of them is in a place called [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6629.72s)]
*  Tannis, which is way up in the north in the Delta. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6631.0s)]
*  That's more than a thousand miles from where that stone came from. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6633.04s)]
*  And then moving that thing. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6635.88s)]
*  I mean, it's a thousand. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6637.4800000000005s)]
*  It was around a thousand tons finished single piece granite. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6638.64s)]
*  So moving it, you may be at fifteen hundred tons or more. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6642.2s)]
*  Like moving that this this is a quarry in Egypt. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6645.24s)]
*  I think it's called the Minya quarry, which has these blocks. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6648.639999999999s)]
*  They're not they're still attached where they've cut these big blocks out. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6651.639999999999s)]
*  And there's like an image of what looks like a giant pharaoh. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6654.4s)]
*  It's been carved on top of it. They're made from limestone. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6657.36s)]
*  Now, maybe they were never intended to be blocks, although maybe they were never [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6659.4s)]
*  intended to be finished. But if you assume their blocks, these two blocks way, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6662.96s)]
*  I think it's three thousand five hundred and five thousand tons a piece based on [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6666.76s)]
*  the density of limestone in that region. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6670.76s)]
*  They're not they're not disconnected, but that's that's the scale. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6673.04s)]
*  We know there's objects up to like twelve hundred tons. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6676.92s)]
*  But the fact that they moved them a thousand miles and we have examples. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6679.200000000001s)]
*  There's a stone called the Russian Thunderstone. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6684.08s)]
*  Have you heard of this? No. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6685.92s)]
*  So like in the seventeen hundreds, they took a big lump of I think it's granite [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6687.12s)]
*  or something like that from from Finland. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6692.160000000001s)]
*  And they shipped it to St. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6694.160000000001s)]
*  Petersburg and they carved into a statue. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6695.280000000001s)]
*  It's still there today. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6696.96s)]
*  It's the Thunderstone. It's in it's a it's an edifice. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6697.8s)]
*  It weighed. That's it. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6700.320000000001s)]
*  That's it now. Yeah, that's the finished one. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6701.64s)]
*  This image here is the right one. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6703.4800000000005s)]
*  So this is how they did it in the seventeen hundreds, the Thunderstone. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6705.400000000001s)]
*  And they moved it around one hundred one hundred and fifty meters a day. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6709.04s)]
*  Took them forever. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6712.92s)]
*  And the only way they did this was by basically sinking giant like logs into [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6713.88s)]
*  the ground to give them a leverage point for these cap stands. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6720.240000000001s)]
*  And they'd move a system of rails, big steel rails with steel ball bearings [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6723.200000000001s)]
*  behind it. It weighed about one thousand five hundred tons. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6727.84s)]
*  And just over a period of just very slow [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6730.48s)]
*  grinding and turning with cap stands and pulleys and these steel tracks, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6733.84s)]
*  they move at about one hundred and fifty meters a day. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6737.5599999999995s)]
*  Took them forever. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6740.4s)]
*  And in order to get that thing across the water from Finland, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6741.32s)]
*  they had to construct a giant barge, like a huge barge. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6745.44s)]
*  And on each side of the barge, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6749.08s)]
*  they would tie up three warships just to try and keep it stable. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6750.639999999999s)]
*  It's about the same size, same mass as the obelisk that's sitting in this [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6754.719999999999s)]
*  mountainous quarry in Egypt, in Aswan. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6759.0s)]
*  It's still in the ground. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6761.72s)]
*  It's like twelve hundred tons of granite. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6762.56s)]
*  And you're expected to believe that they somehow are going to lift this thing up [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6764.64s)]
*  out of a quarry over these basically big hills and mountains of granite [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6767.28s)]
*  and put it on a little ship that's narrowed in this what they would this they [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6771.0s)]
*  call it the harbor there. And it's this tiny little space. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6774.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, you're absolutely delusional [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6776.92s)]
*  if you think this was a simple task that could be achieved by with primitive methods [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6779.400000000001s)]
*  and then ship that thing a thousand miles somewhere. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6783.84s)]
*  When you speculate, when you sit around by yourself, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6786.44s)]
*  because you've thought about this a lot, how the fuck do you think they did this? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6789.28s)]
*  Look, I take a wild wild guess. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6792.8s)]
*  I think there's connections possibly to to to gravity manipulation. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6795.4s)]
*  I think anti-gravity had to have a play [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6800.28s)]
*  a part in moving some of this stuff. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6801.72s)]
*  I actually think there's some connections to some of the work that's being done [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6803.28s)]
*  with this plasmoid implosion technology, the stuff that Randall's been looking [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6807.2s)]
*  into that's coming back to talk a little bit about the relationship and the sacred [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6811.68s)]
*  geometry aspects of that are similar to the things that we see [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6816.2s)]
*  in some of these cultures in the past. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6819.72s)]
*  So that may potentially have something [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6821.48s)]
*  to do with the methods that were used in the past. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6823.88s)]
*  But I'm convinced it was a form of advanced technology. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6826.64s)]
*  Now, whether it's our form of technology, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6830.44s)]
*  because let's face it, we can do things like that today. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6832.72s)]
*  But it takes hydraulics and diesel [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6835.48s)]
*  powers and cranes and all that stuff. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6836.96s)]
*  They may have had an entirely different avenue of tech and that you open up [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6838.5599999999995s)]
*  in the realm of resonance and acoustics and anti-gravity. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6843.32s)]
*  I think resonance in particular might be might have had played a strong role [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6846.36s)]
*  because that's certainly a feature that you see in some of these oldest structures, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6850.88s)]
*  whether it's an accident or not, but some of them are incredibly resonant. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6854.92s)]
*  The Great Pyramid generates a tone just [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6858.04s)]
*  on its own that comes from the earth in there. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6860.24s)]
*  It generates a tone. It does. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6863.44s)]
*  It generates a low tone. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6864.92s)]
*  It's just it's basically coming here. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6866.08s)]
*  Or is it if you're quiet enough, you can. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6867.5599999999995s)]
*  But it's certainly been picked up in a whole number of different experiments [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6869.639999999999s)]
*  where they're measuring the tone it does. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6872.48s)]
*  The whole structure does generate a low tone. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6874.959999999999s)]
*  It's an interesting thing. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6877.719999999999s)]
*  A lot of these places that typically have a connection to underground water as well. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6878.919999999999s)]
*  Like we know there's water beneath the Giza Plateau, places like the Coriakantia [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6882.4s)]
*  in Peru, which is also a giant megalithic building. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6886.08s)]
*  There's an underwater river near there. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6888.2s)]
*  We always see some form of flowing water associated with it. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6890.2s)]
*  Whether or not that has something to do with it. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6893.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know. But it's it's just in that realm of I think it's the answers lay in [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6895.919999999999s)]
*  realms of science that are outside of our current understanding that we should be [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6899.88s)]
*  approaching with an open mind because we might ultimately learn something from it. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6904.32s)]
*  If we do, we instead of just dismissing it, putting in a box and said, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6907.92s)]
*  you know what, we're superior to every civilization that's lived before. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6911.12s)]
*  Right. They're primitive. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6915.12s)]
*  They did it with primitive methods. Right. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6916.32s)]
*  All things are a frequency. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6919.24s)]
*  All things operate on resonance. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6920.64s)]
*  And by the way, a quick little bizarre [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6922.68s)]
*  similarity when you're mentioning antigravity, that Dr. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6924.400000000001s)]
*  Chan Thomas, who wrote the Adam Neve story, [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6926.84s)]
*  he was researching antigravity from MacDonald Doug Douglas back in the 60s. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6929.08s)]
*  Listen, so, Jamie, put that back up, please. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6934.360000000001s)]
*  A recent study published on Ancient [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6937.64s)]
*  Origins website claims that the ancient Egyptians benefited from the sound [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6939.8s)]
*  in the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza and relied on the discovery of a [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6944.360000000001s)]
*  dead end in the rock inside the pyramid room as a tube of acoustic resonance that [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6948.96s)]
*  generates ultrasonic waves at a base frequency within five hertz. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6955.04s)]
*  This raises the questions of the importance of ultrasound for the ancients. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6959.88s)]
*  And can we find the use of sound waves between ancient cultures elsewhere in the world? [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6964.04s)]
*  Yeah, all the boxes to the Serapium is an [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6970.04s)]
*  incredible site that houses like 25 of the biggest stone boxes you'll ever see. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6972.68s)]
*  It's this one spot and they're the biggest ones. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6977.72s)]
*  They're like some of them are up to like 70 tons with their lids, 30 tons. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6979.44s)]
*  And we've I've been there with some people [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6983.48s)]
*  that have been measuring like the frequency resonance range inside there. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6986.08s)]
*  So what range are you generating standard standing waves? [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6989.36s)]
*  And they all seem to have a very similar resonance tone to them. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6992.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's an interesting experiment like you can you can stand inside a water tank [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6996.24s)]
*  or a concrete room and find a resonance, but it's it's it's interesting to go and [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=6999.92s)]
*  actually analyze those aspects of these ancient structures and to speculate maybe [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7004.36s)]
*  this has got anything to do with what they were made for, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7007.84s)]
*  because these are giant precision made [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7010.4s)]
*  boxes made from cyanide and granite that are perfectly flat and square. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7013.12s)]
*  And they're just massively solid. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7017.36s)]
*  They went to tremendous effort to to remove imperfections from the stone. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7019.32s)]
*  No cracks, almost like they didn't want the damn things to shake apart or vibrate. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7023.2s)]
*  Well, it's just the sheer scale of them. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7028.04s)]
*  It flies in the face of logic like the actual archaeologists that want to lock [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7030.48s)]
*  this down and try to come up with some sort of a conventional reason and, you [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7037.5199999999995s)]
*  know, some sort of an explanation that we can all get behind all these police and [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7041.719999999999s)]
*  pushed them on logs like shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7045.48s)]
*  What you're saying doesn't make any goddamn sense. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7048.839999999999s)]
*  It's way more likely that there was [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7050.879999999999s)]
*  incredibly sophisticated technology that existed. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7053.639999999999s)]
*  And it's way more likely in face of the evidence of the younger dry ice impact [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7056.44s)]
*  theory that that shit was wiped out and that we're talking about a really [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7061.5599999999995s)]
*  advanced civilization that lived a long time ago. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7065.5199999999995s)]
*  It's more advanced than we are today, but moved in a different direction. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7068.28s)]
*  Like we moved in the direction of combustion engines and electronics. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7073.639999999999s)]
*  And they moved in some other direction, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7079.12s)]
*  but achieved maybe many thousands of years more sophistication in that direction [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7080.919999999999s)]
*  that we have with our internal combustion engines and electricity and all the shit [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7087.24s)]
*  that we use. And it's important for people to understand that these primitive methods [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7091.28s)]
*  that are suggested and pushed very hard by the mainstream, they don't test any of these. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7094.68s)]
*  Like, show me them moving, you know, a thousand ton stone on logs. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7099.56s)]
*  Let's see that. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7102.88s)]
*  They don't show they've never cut one single box, like you said, in half or even [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7104.4800000000005s)]
*  completed one single average sized box or any box. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7107.88s)]
*  I say box and talking about a stone block with the primitive methods. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7110.72s)]
*  Well, you have shown that they've moved that one one thousand ton stone. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7114.64s)]
*  Right. The thunderstone. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7118.56s)]
*  Yeah. But there's no again, it went using Broadway traction. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7119.4400000000005s)]
*  And a ball bearings. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7122.599999999999s)]
*  Sophisticated, but also the way it's constructed. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7123.679999999999s)]
*  It's just a rock. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7127.12s)]
*  It's not like this amazing obelisk that's carved out of a mountain a thousand miles away. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7128.08s)]
*  There's nothing like that. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7133.04s)]
*  There's also no evidence for it in dynastic Egypt. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7134.36s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7136.639999999999s)]
*  They can't. The earliest parts of look, this crazy thing about it is in the Old [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7137.44s)]
*  Kingdom, the mainstream archaeologists, there's some disagreement on this. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7141.48s)]
*  But in general, they don't give them the they don't grant them the ability to even [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7145.28s)]
*  quarry granite. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7149.959999999999s)]
*  They say that in the Old Kingdom, they couldn't quarry granite. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7151.12s)]
*  They made all of their granite artifacts from surface granite. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7153.28s)]
*  It's just it's the most it's the craziest thing. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7156.56s)]
*  No, no wheel. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7158.52s)]
*  No use of the wheel. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7159.52s)]
*  Never in the Egyptian civilization do they grant them the use of the pulley. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7161.08s)]
*  It was it was literally human horsepower, ropes, levers and wooden sleds. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7164.56s)]
*  That's it. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7169.8s)]
*  The Romans came along and the Greeks and they started using pulleys and false [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7170.44s)]
*  multipliers and stuff like that. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7174.16s)]
*  But they don't there's no evidence for that in the dynastic Egyptian civilization. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7175.24s)]
*  Have you ever had a conversation with all the information that you have at your [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7178.2s)]

*  What do they say on email? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7190.88s)]
*  It's it's it's a lot of it. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7193.04s)]
*  I want to keep my job. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7195.639999999999s)]
*  That's what they say. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7196.88s)]
*  I think there's a bit of that. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7197.68s)]
*  If you read my textbook, it's all the answers. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7198.84s)]

*  Tenured. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7206.76s)]
*  They say, like, oh, we know how they did it because they talk about it. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7207.96s)]
*  So, for example, with the giant statues, right, there's there's a scene on a wall. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7211.88s)]
*  It's called the duty hotep image and it shows the Egyptians. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7215.72s)]

*  Definitely dynastics made the drawing. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7222.84s)]
*  And there's one hundred and fifty six dudes when you count them all up and [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7225.08s)]
*  they're pulling a statue that's tied to a to a to a wooden sled. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7227.72s)]
*  Now, we know this statue, there's parts of it still exist. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7231.2s)]
*  First, it's alabaster. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7234.24s)]
*  It's not granite. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7235.4400000000005s)]
*  Second, it weighs about 56 tons. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7236.16s)]
*  That's fine. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7238.5199999999995s)]
*  And and you're dragging it on a wooden sled. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7239.72s)]
*  You can't use that to explain how you move a thousand ton statue. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7242.48s)]
*  It's just it's not like a sliding scale of difficulty. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7245.88s)]
*  It's you know, there's a there's a curve to it. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7248.84s)]
*  Like you can you can move. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7251.08s)]
*  I do grant them the ability to use primitive methods to move stuff up to like [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7253.16s)]
*  a hundred hundred and fifty tons. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7256.36s)]
*  But once you start getting to four hundred, six hundred, a thousand tons, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7257.84s)]
*  material failure would not an issue that literally sleds would just be crushed or [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7261.0s)]
*  driven into the ground. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7264.8s)]
*  You know, you it's it's there's a there's an absolute [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7266.320000000001s)]
*  scale of difficulty that gets applied to these massive objects. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7271.04s)]
*  And I think it's what are they using to cut these things out of the stone? [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7274.6s)]
*  Well, that's a whole other mystery is particularly in the quarry. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7279.92s)]
*  We can see different technologies and tool marks. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7282.88s)]
*  We know. And this is funny because in the New Kingdom, the 19th dynasty, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7285.6s)]
*  there's Ramsey's the great, the greatest pharaoh of all time. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7290.2s)]
*  Right. He was quarrying granite [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7292.4800000000005s)]
*  from the Middle Pyramid for his own projects. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7294.88s)]
*  He was taking the granite casing blocks and the way they did it and the way that [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7296.88s)]
*  they still do it to some extent is they would hammer out with a flint chisel or [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7300.64s)]
*  even with steel. You hammer away. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7304.52s)]
*  You make a little groove in the granite. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7305.92s)]
*  You smash wood into it. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7307.6s)]
*  You make all these grooves. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7309.16s)]
*  You wet the wood and you split the stone. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7310.360000000001s)]
*  Right. You eventually you hammer at it with chisels. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7312.4800000000005s)]
*  You wet the wood. All this pressure gets on it. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7314.4400000000005s)]
*  You're in your object is to split a piece of stone, crack it off. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7316.12s)]
*  And then I take that piece of stone. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7319.96s)]
*  And it fails all the time. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7321.84s)]
*  And you see this mark all over the place. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7323.08s)]
*  You see it in the quarry. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7324.6s)]
*  You can even see later examples of these chisel marks where they've gotten big [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7325.76s)]
*  chisels. And this might have even been like hundreds of years ago or not Egyptian [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7328.84s)]
*  civilization, but like the the Persian civilization that lived there. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7333.72s)]
*  And then at the quarry, you have these scoop marks like you have this whole other [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7337.280000000001s)]
*  technology that exists where it's like they've scooped away at the granite with an [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7340.96s)]
*  ice cream scoop and it's gone. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7344.68s)]
*  It's under a place we get under a piece of stone. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7346.6s)]
*  Look, they'll tell you that it's this skull was a it's a pounding stone of [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7349.4800000000005s)]
*  dollar right about that big. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7353.48s)]
*  And they reckon they were doing this with it, which is it doesn't make sense at [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7354.48s)]
*  about 15 different levels that I do go through in autistic detail in one of these [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7358.36s)]
*  videos. But, you know, these scoop marks extend to like the underside of rocks [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7362.679999999999s)]
*  where you're pounding up. And it's just it doesn't make sense. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7367.0s)]
*  None of this fits the evidence that gets presented. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7370.08s)]
*  And it's there's something else at work here. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7373.4s)]
*  Like there's there's there's some other [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7375.679999999999s)]
*  technology that's been used to remove this granite at a rapid rate. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7377.04s)]
*  Like the scoop mark in the obelisk is it's a whole other mystery. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7380.24s)]
*  But it's we see it also on other bits of unfinished stone. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7383.44s)]
*  You see scoop marks on some of the blocks on the third pyramid that are unfinished. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7385.96s)]
*  You see them at the Assyrian, which is a massive underground granite structure [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7389.36s)]
*  that's at the Temple of Seti the First with granite blocks that weigh like 90 tons. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7393.4s)]
*  When we were in Egypt together and we're at Aswan, they actually have a granite [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7398.08s)]
*  block with these Dolarite hammers that are round Dolarite black stones that are [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7403.28s)]
*  like eight, ten pounds of pop. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7408.679999999999s)]
*  And you're allowed to bang away at it. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7409.96s)]
*  I have video of one of my videos on YouTube. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7411.68s)]
*  It's me doing it. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7413.52s)]
*  And if you ever take an eight to ten pound weight and start banging across, [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7414.64s)]
*  first of all, it feels like you're going to get arthritis within a few minutes. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7418.56s)]
*  And you see that you're only chipping away particles of dust. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7421.6s)]
*  It is the least feasible explanation ever. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7425.0s)]
*  And anyone that simply picks up one [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7427.92s)]
*  of these Dolarite hammers and bangs away on a piece of granite themselves will see [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7429.4400000000005s)]
*  that it's nonsense and not only that, those scoop marks that you mentioned. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7432.68s)]
*  I don't know, Jamie, if you're able to type in [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7436.56s)]
*  Aswan, unfinished obelisk and you see these scoops, they're symmetrical. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7439.0s)]
*  It doesn't make sense that that would be done by handwork. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7445.4800000000005s)]
*  See, that's what we're talking about. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7447.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's in rose granite. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7448.28s)]
*  That's as hard as a rock, so to speak. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7449.64s)]
*  I'm having a hard time understanding how that's even possible. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7453.24s)]
*  It looks like it was sandblasted. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7457.12s)]
*  It's something that's scooping the granite. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7459.24s)]
*  You actually have these test pits as well, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7461.4400000000005s)]
*  like these pits that go down like 15, 20 feet. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7463.16s)]
*  Look at the size of that obelisk. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7465.56s)]
*  You have these holes around the side of it [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7466.92s)]
*  where they call them test pits because what you want to do. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7468.5599999999995s)]
*  And this gets back to my comment about the ability to quarry granite, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7470.679999999999s)]
*  is the quality of granite that it takes to take an object like that or like [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7474.32s)]
*  it's actually from a guy that went on my tour, [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7480.0s)]
*  that the quality of granite that it takes to make large objects like that. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7482.4s)]
*  And a lot of the quality of granite that we see on the Giza Plateau, [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7486.36s)]
*  it's you're talking 30 feet. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7489.16s)]
*  There's a test pit. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7490.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a test pit. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7491.639999999999s)]
*  They're like 30 feet inside a granite mountain. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7492.5199999999995s)]
*  None of that. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7494.32s)]
*  You don't get this quality of granite at the surface level [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7494.84s)]
*  with just granite pieces lying around. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7498.52s)]
*  And you can go to Giza today, Fourth Dynasty, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7500.4400000000005s)]
*  and look at the blocks of granite that were hanging off the valley temple or [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7503.08s)]
*  the pyramid temple and the huge crystal occlusions in them. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7506.52s)]
*  Like this stuff came from the core of granite mountains. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7510.72s)]
*  You can't say that the dynastic and the old kingdom guys didn't have the ability [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7512.76s)]
*  to quarry granite. Maybe they didn't. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7516.08s)]
*  But whoever made those granite blocks sure as hell did, [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7517.84s)]
*  because that's where it comes from. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7520.16s)]
*  Real quick, this image right down here, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7522.0s)]
*  that black rock is the Dolarite hammer. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7523.8s)]
*  And when Ben was just mentioning from underneath these scoop marks, [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7526.200000000001s)]
*  so they want to claim that that's how they did it, [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7529.08s)]
*  that they were banging away with this rock basically upwards. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7531.04s)]
*  Well, yeah, you actually get there's a consistent line. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7533.96s)]
*  So on the wall behind where we're standing, it's like 20 feet high. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7536.52s)]
*  And you'll see a horizontal ridge that runs all the way down that line underneath [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7540.320000000001s)]
*  and then up underneath the other piece of rock. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7544.88s)]
*  It's like this consistent groove. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7547.400000000001s)]
*  This is exactly what I did. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7548.96s)]
*  He's banging on it with a with a Dolarite pounder. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7550.56s)]
*  Nothing about this is fun. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7553.44s)]
*  And is this are they trying to say that this is how they did it? [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7555.0s)]
*  Is that what they make you watch a video, Joe? [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7558.5199999999995s)]
*  They indoctrinate you at this site. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7560.88s)]
*  It's one that's the one site where they sit you down and make you watch a video [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7562.24s)]
*  before you're allowed to go out and look at the site. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7565.24s)]
*  12 minutes. Yeah, you got to sit there. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7567.5199999999995s)]
*  You watch it. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7569.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's a video that says this is how they did it. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7570.16s)]
*  It was incredible. And they're insistent. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7572.32s)]
*  And what's wild is that if you just do it, when you do something yourself, [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7574.4s)]
*  you realize just like that's not I don't know how they did it, but it wasn't this [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7577.639999999999s)]
*  that there we go. I filmed this. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7580.599999999999s)]
*  These are wonderful gentlemen that traveled with us to Egypt back in November. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7583.36s)]
*  Engineers. Yeah. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7587.599999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7589.2s)]
*  So it is possible to do that with the stone. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7590.0s)]
*  Yeah, but not feasible and certainly not on the scale of those obelisks. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7593.719999999999s)]
*  So there's that's right. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7598.4s)]
*  There's been some tests that have been done. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7599.5599999999995s)]
*  And I get into it. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7601.16s)]
*  And I think it's something like, I've got to say, about 70 cubic centimeters [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7602.16s)]
*  or something like that, that you can remove with that method over a solid hour. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7606.28s)]
*  And I think it's it's either 50 or 70. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7610.96s)]
*  But it's put it this way, it's three quarters the volume of a golf ball. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7613.4400000000005s)]
*  Or two, two fifths the volume of a chicken egg. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7617.2s)]
*  Like, that's how much material you can [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7619.8s)]
*  remove in an hour by just nonstop pounding of granite dust. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7621.52s)]
*  That's the best estimate we have. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7625.280000000001s)]
*  So what you've got to imagine is that entire trench around this obelisk. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7626.84s)]
*  Bear in mind, the trench is only two [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7631.24s)]
*  thirds as deep as it needs to be to remove a square section. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7632.88s)]
*  But if you filled that whole thing up [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7635.96s)]
*  with golf balls and added another 25 percent, that's the number of hours it [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7637.5199999999995s)]
*  might take to go back to that past image with that method. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7641.719999999999s)]
*  Is that is the idea that that obelisk was left there because of the crack? [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7644.24s)]
*  Yeah, it develops. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7648.48s)]
*  Supposedly, what they tell you is it [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7649.5199999999995s)]
*  developed a crack across the center and they left it there. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7651.08s)]
*  Now, I think the crack could be the result of later quarrying attempts. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7654.5199999999995s)]
*  When they found this, it was utterly buried. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7657.919999999999s)]
*  Like it was there was one small section of it poking out. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7659.639999999999s)]
*  And the rest of it at the bottom here was like under nine meters of rubble. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7662.5199999999995s)]
*  And there were other big quarried blocks. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7665.5599999999995s)]
*  I actually think this could have been here long. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7667.24s)]
*  I think the Egyptians were using the quarry, [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7669.88s)]
*  but I think this object could have been they just poured stuff onto it. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7671.5199999999995s)]
*  It just was at the oldest part of the quarry. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7675.2s)]
*  What's the wackiest explanation for these scoop marks? [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7677.12s)]
*  Wackiest? [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7682.16s)]
*  I mean, like not worried whatsoever about people's [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7683.12s)]
*  interpretation of you and your ability to discern reality. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7688.04s)]
*  Like what it's it's like is, yeah, some sort of molecular softening tool [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7691.48s)]
*  that just comes in and scoops it out, like somehow gets between the [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7695.4s)]
*  softening like can soften the stone, can change the molecular bonds beneath [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7698.679999999999s)]
*  the stone, because it's made up of all these granites, like a composite material [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7702.599999999999s)]
*  made up of a bunch of different types of horn blend and crystal quartz and [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7705.759999999999s)]
*  a bunch of stuff like that, and then just being able to somehow scoop it out. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7711.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7715.32s)]
*  It's as if it looks that way when you look at it. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7716.04s)]
*  You've got to think it's either some sonic tool. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7718.639999999999s)]
*  There's something going on that is [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7721.44s)]
*  enabling them to scoop that material out of there in an effortless fashion. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7723.2s)]
*  These scoops in places, it's almost as if they articulate like we see in places. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7726.639999999999s)]
*  Is it a recent observation we made? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7731.48s)]
*  It's not just straight down, but they bend. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7732.8s)]
*  Imagine a backhoe arm sticking here. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7734.76s)]
*  It does this. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7736.5599999999995s)]
*  And you see that in some of these scoops. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7737.76s)]
*  They literally there's an articulation to these lines. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7739.32s)]
*  So maybe there was a tool that was anchored and it almost looks like it had [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7742.16s)]
*  a very flexible tip, but it was some rotating tool that just chewed out this [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7746.0s)]
*  stone. And that's where Chris Dunn goes with it. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7749.2s)]
*  There may be some sort of rotating tool. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7751.92s)]
*  The interesting thing about the quarry also is that there is in an area, there is [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7757.72s)]
*  drawings on the wall of the quarry where there's all these scoop marks of these [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7762.32s)]
*  ostriches and it matches pre dynastic drawings. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7766.2s)]
*  So it's almost as if there were people in that quarry making paintings on [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7770.08s)]
*  earlier done scoop marks before the dynastic Egyptian even [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7774.679999999999s)]
*  civilization even started. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7778.24s)]
*  So it's I think I think that scoop mark stuff is absolutely a part of this ancient [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7779.639999999999s)]
*  lost civilization. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7785.76s)]
*  There was some and it's one of their working areas. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7786.639999999999s)]
*  There's a tremendous value in seeing unfinished work because we get to have a [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7788.44s)]
*  little bit of insight into how did this tool potentially function? [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7792.28s)]
*  How did it work? [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7795.8s)]
*  Like you have to have an open mind to kind of look at it that way. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7796.96s)]
*  We see the same thing on a couple of objects that are unfinished. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7801.04s)]
*  There's some incontrovertible evidence for machining and things like that. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7803.72s)]
*  In other objects hurts my brain. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7807.84s)]
*  It really does because you start thinking like what what happened? [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7809.88s)]
*  Like what are we talking about? [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7813.160000000001s)]
*  Like what what what kind of technology was available then? [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7814.64s)]
*  Like when you think about a completely different branch of technology that was [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7817.4800000000005s)]
*  achieved 20,000 years ago or whatever it was, you really there's nothing there. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7824.240000000001s)]
*  Like you're just spinning your wheels, just guessing. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7830.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7832.84s)]
*  Speaking of technology, [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7833.5599999999995s)]
*  Jamie, you should Google the Kufu ship because the largest vessel that's ever [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7836.32s)]
*  been found from ancient Egypt is a canoe, basically. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7841.72s)]
*  And now and there's no other depictions. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7845.4s)]
*  Now, I'm not suggesting that no one's [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7847.88s)]
*  suggesting that this boat was used to tug and move around large stones. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7849.48s)]
*  But it's worth mentioning that of all the [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7854.08s)]
*  descriptions that you see or inscriptions, excuse me, this 140 foot long boat is the [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7856.599999999999s)]
*  largest boat ever found as a bullshit boat. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7862.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's a I've said it before and I feel bad, but it's a shit box in comparison. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7864.84s)]
*  It is a total shit box. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7868.599999999999s)]
*  It's such a bad design. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7870.12s)]
*  Like look how low it has, like very little depth in the water. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7871.76s)]
*  So it will have very little stability. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7876.2s)]
*  And then it's also top heavy. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7878.36s)]
*  It's like driving around on a fucking sprinter van on a racetrack. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7879.8s)]
*  You know, you can top right over. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7883.76s)]
*  Yeah. Any wave at all is tipping that bullshit boat. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7885.32s)]
*  Right. And they found this right next to the pyramid, by the way. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7888.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7890.5199999999995s)]
*  It's pretty fun. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7891.0s)]
*  And you get the same thing here. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7891.96s)]
*  It's like there is a wall scene at Saqqara where they show a very small column on a boat. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7893.4400000000005s)]
*  Like it's this it's a column that barely comes up to a guy's knees and it's on a boat. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7899.320000000001s)]
*  It shows them shipping a small column and they go see that one. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7903.4400000000005s)]
*  That's how they did it. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7906.16s)]
*  By your cursor, Jamie. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7906.84s)]
*  No, the one above it to the left, to the left, right there above it and to the left. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7907.92s)]
*  You got to use the latest pointer. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7911.92s)]
*  That one. Yeah, should have. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7913.12s)]
*  Imagine taking your kids on that. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7914.16s)]
*  You wouldn't. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7916.16s)]
*  We're going to go out into the ocean on that. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7917.16s)]
*  You like it. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7920.24s)]
*  I don't know if that's an ocean boat. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7921.24s)]
*  Your kids would be taken for whatever. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7922.48s)]
*  Even a river. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7923.84s)]
*  Fuck out of here. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7925.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's for like a pond. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7925.96s)]
*  That's for a pond. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7927.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's a swan boat. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7929.0s)]
*  Is there any evidence for even afterlife life preservers back then? [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7930.5599999999995s)]
*  Do they have a vest? [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7934.48s)]
*  Didn't matter because they had the hippos and crocodiles that take care of it. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7935.68s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7938.28s)]
*  Hippos and crocs. I forgot about those. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7939.2s)]
*  But that's the point. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7940.5599999999995s)]
*  The point that's significant in this is that that is the largest boat that they've ever [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7941.32s)]
*  found. And my point is, is that if they're going to claim that they were moving, you [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7945.72s)]
*  know, 100 ton stone blocks on barges, I just want to iterate that they've never found [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7949.2s)]
*  one and there was no inscription that shows anything large enough that would have done [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7955.28s)]
*  it. Right. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7958.48s)]
*  Right. And there's also no inscriptions at all of the constructions of the pyramids. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7959.72s)]
*  That's right. Zero. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7964.72s)]
*  Well, so there is there is, but not the big ones. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7966.04s)]
*  There's a there's a tomb of the nobles that's over near on the West Bank of the Nile at [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7969.24s)]
*  Luxor, but it shows them literally making mud bricks and building a mud brick pyramid. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7974.24s)]
*  Mud, mud bricks, which is all they made, a lot of mud brick pyramids. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7978.2s)]
*  Yeah. But later. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7981.64s)]
*  Well, there was one person at one point in time that was speculating that the pyramids [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7983.44s)]
*  are made with concrete and they devised some sort of a way to make concrete out of granite. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7987.2s)]
*  The geopolymer theory drives me nuts on a daily basis. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7994.5199999999995s)]
*  It seems like total horse shit. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7997.64s)]
*  It is. Yeah, it is. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=7999.2s)]
*  Look, it's an interesting since they know the quarries. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8000.84s)]
*  The quarries right there. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8003.4s)]
*  There's literally holes in the ground that match the objects that we have. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8004.16s)]
*  There's behind the middle pyramid is [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8007.6s)]
*  the middle pyramid. They cut it out of a hill like they cut it into a hill. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8011.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8013.76s)]
*  Like they had to cut down 40 feet at the back and put these massive tiles into the [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8014.68s)]
*  front. They plopped a pyramid on it for some reason. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8018.400000000001s)]
*  But at the back in that in that area where they cut the wall down, it's a quarry. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8020.6s)]
*  You literally see where there's that's where they cut big blocks of limestone off. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8024.0s)]
*  The little stubs from the blocks are still there. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8028.080000000001s)]
*  I mean, and we have quarries. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8030.6s)]
*  And not only that, all the blocks are different sizes. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8032.52s)]
*  They're not one offs. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8035.0s)]
*  So if you were literally filling in [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8035.8s)]
*  gel polymer, you would have a lot that are the same size. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8037.2s)]
*  You would have, you know, you'd be filling it. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8039.68s)]
*  And so since they're all different sizes, it's like that doesn't that's not what you [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8041.4400000000005s)]
*  would have if they were filling. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8045.0s)]
*  What is the speculation as to why they're different sizes? [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8046.64s)]
*  Like why why do they do that? [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8049.400000000001s)]
*  Like one of the cool things that you showed in one of your videos, which shows [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8051.320000000001s)]
*  the similarities between the construction methods of ancient Japan and Peru and Egypt, [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8054.56s)]
*  is that so many of these stones, they're like these odd shapes that like jigsaw [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8059.2s)]
*  puzzles and they're fit in perfectly polygonal. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8063.72s)]
*  Yeah, they fit in. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8066.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, don't worry. That's just a coincidence. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8067.240000000001s)]
*  There are these these polygonal walls that are found in multiple continents around [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8069.160000000001s)]
*  the world. The fact that there's pyramids and five continents around the world, [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8072.96s)]
*  there's it's it's they say it's a coincidence. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8076.8s)]
*  This is a natural progression of civilization that a pyramid. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8079.76s)]
*  It's like, oh, it's come on. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8084.360000000001s)]
*  Kids with blocks will make a pyramid. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8085.400000000001s)]
*  Makes sense, which is why we make them today. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8087.04s)]
*  Right. But if you look at comparisons of the Indonesia pyramids and the ones in [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8089.08s)]
*  Central America and Mexico, like they have similarities of like the strip steps [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8092.6s)]
*  that go up the middle of it. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8096.84s)]
*  I use the analogy of like skyscrapers that we have skyscrapers in any major city [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8098.08s)]
*  around the world. And they're all the same based on that. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8102.84s)]
*  You have steel and concrete and glass, but they're all different. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8105.4400000000005s)]
*  You have a different architect here and they look a little different, [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8108.64s)]
*  but it's still the same thing. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8110.52s)]
*  But is it really feasible to say or is it a coincidence that they just happen to [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8112.08s)]
*  start building pyramids on multiple continents around the world or these [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8116.88s)]
*  polygonal walls that are whether it's from Peru, Egypt, places in Italy, Greece. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8120.04s)]
*  There's a great there's a pyramid in Greece. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8125.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that in the video. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8127.08s)]
*  Let's look pull up your video. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8128.360000000001s)]
*  Tell Jamie what that video is just so we could see some of the images that compare [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8130.4800000000005s)]
*  these polygonal walls. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8133.64s)]
*  If I was Elon Musk, you know what I would do? [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8135.360000000001s)]
*  I'd hire someone to make a pyramid. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8137.08s)]
*  I'm like, let me see if you can do it. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8138.88s)]
*  Who's the best motherfucker around? [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8140.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to throw a billion dollars at this project. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8141.8s)]
*  I bought Twitter for 44 billion into it. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8144.280000000001s)]
*  Let's make me a pyramid, bitch. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8147.56s)]
*  It's got to do it. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8149.2s)]
*  It's got to make it as accurate as the as the fucking money back. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8150.04s)]
*  Yeah, line up. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8154.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it'd be a wonderful, by the way, that Joe tweeted it this morning. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8156.0s)]
*  So it'll be the first one they tweeted makes it easy to find. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8159.24s)]
*  Yeah, I was tweeting it when I was watching. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8162.16s)]
*  I was like, people need to watch this. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8163.72s)]
*  This is nuts. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8165.12s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8166.08s)]
*  And was I going to say I had something South American polygonal walls? [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8166.96s)]
*  I mean, it's literally the most difficult way to do it. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8171.84s)]
*  That's the crazy thing is like, this is not how you solve the building a wall [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8174.28s)]
*  problem. Like if you say they got to a different just independently, like [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8178.08s)]
*  making these complex polygonal walls, that's not how you solve that. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8181.84s)]
*  Is there any speculation to what the advantage of polygonal walls? [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8185.44s)]
*  Well, they say that it's definitely true. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8189.6s)]
*  Like, so, yes, you don't have a single line of vector of force, so it won't tip over. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8192.56s)]
*  But this is where I get crazy about things like the Giza Plateau. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8197.4s)]
*  You have both. You have polygonal walls that are made like that at Giza from the [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8201.52s)]
*  Fourth Dynasty. And then you also have much more regular construction from [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8206.16s)]
*  smaller limestone blocks also at the Fourth Dynasty that at Giza that are still [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8210.039999999999s)]
*  standing. It's like they've all been through earthquakes. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8214.48s)]
*  Both types are still here. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8217.36s)]
*  I mean, it's difficult to say that, oh, they just made it that way to make it [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8219.2s)]
*  earthquake proof. I'm like half the Chitae is still standing up like it went through [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8222.039999999999s)]
*  earthquakes. It's so here you see one from Egypt, one from go back, one from [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8225.24s)]
*  Mexico and one from Cambodia. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8232.039999999999s)]
*  And what is the explanation for the ones in Cambodia? [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8235.48s)]
*  Do they know who built those and why? [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8238.880000000001s)]
*  That's a good question. I have to refresh my notes on that. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8242.52s)]
*  They go more modern civil like more modern ancient cultures, I guess. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8244.880000000001s)]
*  Nothing. They're like fifteen hundred years old. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8249.04s)]
*  They're not supposed to be forty five hundred years old or something like that. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8250.92s)]
*  And the reason why this is significant is because if the Great Pyramid is forty [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8253.28s)]
*  five hundred years old, my argument is that there are connections across the [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8256.56s)]
*  oceans that are not supposed to exist because according to everything, they're [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8260.56s)]
*  adamant. It wasn't until Christopher Columbus, fourteen ninety two, sailed the [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8263.96s)]
*  ocean blue. But yet there is evidence that goes back more than a thousand years [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8267.0s)]
*  prior that suggests play, Jamie, just press play so we can see some of these [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8270.4s)]
*  images because they go pretty rapid fire. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8273.679999999998s)]
*  And it's really, really well done, this video. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8276.08s)]
*  And I'm glad that you gave credit to all the people that helped you out in that, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8278.72s)]
*  too. Yeah, there's polygonal walls. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8282.599999999999s)]
*  There's these this nub phenomena. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8285.48s)]
*  There's similarities across numerous continents. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8287.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's really wild stuff because it's so it's so obvious that somehow or another [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8290.84s)]
*  these these people had to be in communication with each other or sharing [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8298.92s)]
*  information or had carried information from other places. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8302.92s)]
*  Right. You know what? While we're this is the same video that has the Egypt, Japan [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8306.12s)]
*  sarcophagus similarity. Yeah. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8310.68s)]
*  I don't remember. It's earlier in the video or later in the video. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8312.2s)]
*  But if you skip around. Yeah, look at that. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8315.24s)]
*  And what part of Greece is that? [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8317.04s)]
*  It's not Athens. I'd have to double check. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8318.880000000001s)]
*  I made this video like three years ago, so I'd have to double check. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8321.24s)]
*  I haven't looked at this in a while, to be honest with you. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8323.76s)]
*  Well, there's also the weirdness of the Acropolis and the Parthenon, right? [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8325.52s)]
*  Like that the Acropolis was built on the Parthenon. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8330.76s)]
*  But like what? Who built that? [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8333.52s)]
*  Yeah, they don't even talk about it. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8335.8s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8337.44s)]
*  Right. Look at that fucking that's sex a woman. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8338.6s)]
*  Yeah, this is Peru. That's that's in the streets of Cusco. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8341.28s)]
*  Is it really sex a woman? [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8344.12s)]
*  That sounds like a hot check. Sexy woman. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8345.72s)]
*  Sexy woman. Yeah, it's Italy. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8347.84s)]
*  Look at they have been in Italy, too. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8350.48s)]
*  Wow. These polygonal walls, you can find them in Japan. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8351.92s)]
*  East. Yeah. Easter Island. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8354.720000000001s)]
*  And who do they think built these in Italy? [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8356.64s)]
*  A lot of it's attributed to the Romans in this in the same way that, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8360.36s)]
*  you know, Baalbek is all attributed to the Romans, right, [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8364.12s)]
*  which doesn't make any sense. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8367.08s)]
*  Like not the foundation of it, the the July. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8368.52s)]
*  On stones. Yeah. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8371.0s)]
*  Crown on stones. Yeah. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8371.960000000001s)]
*  Eight, nine hundred tons. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8373.28s)]
*  Yeah. Three of them, nine hundred tons each. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8374.4s)]
*  And then it's just so strange because it's such a strange way [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8376.16s)]
*  of constructing things, and yet it exists all over the world. Right. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8379.68s)]
*  It's actually the most difficult way to construct something. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8383.32s)]
*  And we're looking at this after thousands of years. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8385.56s)]
*  Who knows how many earthquakes, weather erosion. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8388.32s)]
*  Look how good the Peru one is, though. That's amazing. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8391.08s)]
*  Some of the details in these are astonishing, these little tiny notches. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8393.76s)]
*  But it's just matched throughout. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8397.96s)]
*  It's matched on all the sides of the stone. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8399.4s)]
*  And it's not just surface level either. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8401.28s)]
*  It goes all the way through the mating surfaces of the stones. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8403.32s)]
*  This is the Valley Temple in Egypt. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8407.84s)]
*  God, so wild. That's the Assyrian. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8410.119999999999s)]
*  I can just tell by like, look at the Japan one. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8414.52s)]
*  Now, most people aren't even aware of this. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8416.6s)]
*  No one from Japan. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8418.08s)]
*  And like what what when do they date these Japanese structures? [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8419.4s)]
*  I'd have to double check. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8424.96s)]
*  I know they're accredited to be in some castle by some guy. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8426.119999999999s)]
*  I'd have to double check, but I'm going to go ahead and guess [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8429.36s)]
*  a thousand to fifteen hundred years. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8431.199999999999s)]
*  Go back just a little bit, Jamie. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8433.0s)]
*  But I think they're probably older. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8434.96s)]
*  The Japan one, not this one. Right there. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8436.24s)]
*  Bam. Stop. Look at the size of that one stone. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8438.12s)]
*  Yeah, probably 500 tons, I bet. 400 probably. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8440.96s)]
*  Holy shit. Yeah, around there. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8443.16s)]
*  Just eyeballing it. I've been doing this long enough. Yeah. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8445.4s)]
*  I mean, look at that gentleman who's standing there. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8448.28s)]
*  Depends how deep it is, I guess. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8450.84s)]
*  But yeah, it's a giant piece of stone. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8452.04s)]
*  I am pushing that thing. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8453.96s)]
*  Logs out together now. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8458.12s)]
*  Lift it up. We fucking put that. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8459.08s)]
*  It's above the other ones. Yeah. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8460.72s)]
*  Right. It's not even the one that's on the bottom. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8462.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. How? [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8465.800000000001s)]
*  Let's see that sarcophagus compared to the one in Egypt. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8467.48s)]
*  I'm not sure what part of the video. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8470.12s)]
*  Look at the one above it and to the right. Oh, yeah. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8471.2s)]
*  God. Oh, I should use this. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8473.6s)]
*  Look at that one there. Yeah. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8475.32s)]
*  That one and that one. Immense. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8476.76s)]
*  I mean, just so incredible. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8480.32s)]
*  Keep going a little bit more. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8481.960000000001s)]
*  It's not can't be too far off. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8483.04s)]
*  A little bit. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8485.68s)]
*  It's worth seeing. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8488.68s)]
*  I think. Yeah, I think. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8489.880000000001s)]
*  Because when people are about to see this, it is a it is such an unbelievable [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8493.68s)]
*  similarity and again, ancient Japan and ancient Egypt are not supposed [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8498.64s)]
*  have any type of contact whatsoever. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8502.720000000001s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8505.08s)]
*  They may be early in the video. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8506.880000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure. Keep going. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8507.880000000001s)]
*  Maybe one of the earlier part. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8509.880000000001s)]
*  I don't believe so. I watched it today. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8511.16s)]
*  I think it was later. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8513.44s)]
*  My baby search for like Japanese sarcophagus little something. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8515.12s)]
*  I forget the name of those little things where you can just jump to it. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8518.28s)]
*  Some people do that in those videos. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8522.08s)]
*  Oh, this is a question. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8523.92s)]
*  Why does he have a fucking watch on? Go back. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8525.2s)]
*  Isn't that a watch? [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8528.08s)]
*  How dare you? That's impossible. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8529.72s)]
*  So what the fuck is that jewelry? [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8531.960000000001s)]
*  It looks like a watch. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8534.08s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's jewelry, but it's literally on his wrist. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8535.28s)]
*  And it's a circle. And it's with a band. Right. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8539.76s)]
*  I mean, yeah. What is that? [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8543.0s)]
*  Is that a sundial? [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8544.84s)]
*  I thought fuck is on his wrist. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8546.28s)]
*  So many anti-kathera mechanism. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8547.84s)]
*  I mean, it looks like my watch. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8549.92s)]
*  It does. That's crazy. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8552.0s)]
*  A lot of people, I saw many, many comments of people saying the same thing. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8554.12s)]
*  That's a watch. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8557.4s)]
*  But, you know, of course, the explanation is like, of course not. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8558.68s)]
*  Just jewelry. Nothing to see here. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8561.08s)]
*  But it does look like it, doesn't it? [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8562.8s)]
*  Well, it just makes sense that if they developed weapons [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8564.4s)]
*  and they develop clothing and they develop shelters, [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8567.88s)]
*  and then they figured out mechanisms, [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8571.28s)]
*  if they had the sophistication to be able to construct these buildings, [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8574.2s)]
*  why wouldn't they have the sophistication to be able to construct a watch? [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8578.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8581.88s)]
*  An automatic watch. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8583.119999999999s)]
*  If you want to talk about ancient technology, speaking of this, [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8584.48s)]
*  like on the left, that trident, [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8586.8s)]
*  many accredited it to being originated from the Vajra. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8588.96s)]
*  And did you see Elon Musk's bedside table picture that he put on Twitter? [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8591.92s)]
*  Yes, I did. But I don't remember a trident. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8597.96s)]
*  Was there a trident in there? [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8599.68s)]
*  Look, the Vajra, which comes from the trident or the trident comes from that. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8600.56s)]
*  He had that in the lower left corner of the picture. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8605.08s)]
*  If you were to Google Elon Musk's bedside photo, lower left corner, [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8607.68s)]
*  that is the symbol that comes from ancient Hindu [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8612.039999999999s)]
*  that is supposed to be the most powerful thing in the entire universe. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8613.88s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8618.16s)]
*  This is a staged photo. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8619.08s)]
*  I don't know if Elon Musk is trolling or if he's literally... [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8620.64s)]
*  Because he's been talking about that he thinks that his life could be in jeopardy. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8623.72s)]
*  He's going against the grain and all this freedom of speech stuff. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8626.199999999999s)]
*  And I don't see... Bottom left corner. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8630.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, click on that. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8632.0s)]
*  The Buddhism ritual object, if you Google the Vajra, the A-J-R-A, [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8633.119999999999s)]
*  it's an ancient symbol. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8637.880000000001s)]
*  That guy has a cosplay gun and caffeine-free diet coke. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8639.08s)]
*  I don't know what that's about. He needs to get rid of those diet cokes. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8642.68s)]
*  Oh. Well, he likes it. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8644.880000000001s)]
*  That's... No. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8646.400000000001s)]
*  No? [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8648.640000000001s)]
*  Awful. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8649.560000000001s)]
*  Why? [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8650.24s)]
*  You like that? [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8650.960000000001s)]
*  What do you mean, like diet coke? [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8651.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8653.16s)]
*  I don't mind diet coke. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8653.92s)]
*  Yeah, you drink diet coke? [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8654.800000000001s)]
*  I've drank diet coke before. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8655.92s)]
*  You're into that artificial sweetener scene? [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8657.32s)]
*  I'm not worried about it. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8659.52s)]
*  No. When I talk to nutritionists, I don't think it's really that big of an idea. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8660.960000000001s)]
*  Depends on how much you drink. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8664.84s)]
*  I mean, it looks like Elon's drinking a shit ton of it. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8666.240000000002s)]
*  Because he's got like the stains on the thing. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8668.68s)]
*  But, all right, so the bottom... [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8671.480000000001s)]
*  He's drunk four of them, and they're caffeine-free, which is weird. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8672.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So between that George Washington pistol and the fact... [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8674.960000000001s)]
*  That's not a George Washington pistol. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8678.16s)]
*  That's a cosplay pistol from a video game. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8679.960000000001s)]
*  No, the one above it. The musket. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8682.04s)]
*  Oh, the one above it. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8683.76s)]
*  This is a staged photo. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8684.68s)]
*  So the fact that he has that Vajra in the lower left corner, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8686.0s)]
*  I wonder, this is conspiracy, which I'm all into, [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8689.880000000001s)]
*  is he essentially sending a shot off the bow to the people who he thinks are going after him, [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8693.480000000001s)]
*  which is that I have knowledge of something involving... [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8697.76s)]
*  Because here we are. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8700.76s)]
*  Like, we have Randall Carlson bringing back on. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8701.68s)]
*  There's all this speculation that there has been a limitless energy device [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8704.0s)]
*  that has come from the ancients that has been essentially redeveloped. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8707.84s)]
*  And then in a short period of time, you have Elon Musk posting this picture [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8711.12s)]
*  while he's also talking about that he believes that his life could be at jeopardy. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8714.12s)]
*  He's taking certain security precautions. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8717.36s)]
*  This is a staged photo. It makes no sense. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8719.68s)]
*  November 28th, 2022, my bedside table. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8722.32s)]
*  This at 3.48 a.m. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8725.039999999999s)]
*  What is this? Either he's trolling, and maybe, or is he trying... [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8727.52s)]
*  Why would he put that Vajra in the lower left corner? [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8732.6s)]
*  The symbol that means that other people can correlate with a limitless free energy technology [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8734.76s)]
*  that may have once existed, and that's where the trident comes from. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8740.039999999999s)]
*  So I don't understand how was the Vajra... [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8742.36s)]
*  How did it supposedly work? [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8745.32s)]
*  Oh, that is a whole other thing. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8746.8s)]
*  Like, that I couldn't explain, but it's... [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8748.16s)]
*  But it's supposed to represent limitless energy? [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8750.44s)]
*  Some have said that. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8753.52s)]
*  What it does represent in Hindu culture is the most powerful weapon and device of the universe. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8754.72s)]
*  Do you know any more about it, Ben? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8761.24s)]
*  A bunch of string. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8762.56s)]
*  No, I don't. I know this is the other stuff, the handbag. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8763.88s)]
*  I was going to ask, can I pee while you guys talk about that? [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8766.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go pee. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8768.84s)]
*  I have to pee too, actually. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8769.64s)]
*  All right, let's pause. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8770.48s)]
*  Really bad. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8771.08s)]
*  You guys go pee. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8771.56s)]
*  All right. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8772.279999999999s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8773.76s)]
*  And we're back. Are we back? We're back. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8775.64s)]
*  That was excellent. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8779.240000000002s)]
*  Really? All right. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8781.16s)]
*  So where were we? [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8782.12s)]
*  History's bullshit. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8784.0s)]
*  That's right. And Elon Musk has all the secrets. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8784.92s)]
*  He's got something. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8787.12s)]
*  He's got some secrets. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8789.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he obviously felt very compelled to buy Twitter. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8790.880000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's not like... [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8795.36s)]
*  It's not... [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8797.16s)]
*  I mean, $44 billion is a lot of goddamn money and he overpaid for it. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8797.6s)]
*  But it felt like there's a need to have some sort of an uncensored distribution of information, [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8801.36s)]
*  or at least ungovernment-censored. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8807.8s)]
*  This is why I'm such a fan of them. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8810.96s)]
*  Anyone at this point in time that is an advocate for free speech, I'm on your side. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8812.279999999999s)]
*  This is... We live in a wild time. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8816.72s)]
*  Anyone with their eyes that's paying attention sees that there's people controlling information. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8818.759999999998s)]
*  And throughout history, this has been proven time and time again to lead to tyranny when you stop people from sharing things. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8823.679999999998s)]
*  So I'm 38 years old. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8830.48s)]
*  And growing up, I remember back in the day, people could say whatever they wanted. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8831.84s)]
*  Free speech was real. You're allowed to have it. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8835.439999999999s)]
*  Worst case scenario, people ridicule you. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8837.12s)]
*  And everything was fine. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8839.0s)]
*  And now we're entering this age where things are being called dangerous. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8840.76s)]
*  Like ancient apocalypse. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8843.64s)]
*  That's dangerous misinformation. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8845.08s)]
*  It's like, no, the only thing dangerous is stopping people from having a voice. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8846.88s)]
*  Well, also, when you start attributing... [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8850.24s)]
*  When you put words on that like racism, and you start putting those kind of accusations towards... [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8852.28s)]
*  If you watch that special, the series, and you say, oh, this is racist, you're a fucking idiot. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8859.48s)]
*  I mean, it's really that simple. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8867.12s)]
*  Or you're a dangerous asshole who wants to change the reality of what this guy is actually talking about. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8868.48s)]
*  Right. Throughout history, anyone, whether it's the Nazis, the Stalinists, the Maoists, and everyone else, anyone that's ever censored people, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8875.52s)]
*  the people who censor other people, they're always the bad guys, historically. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8881.92s)]
*  Always. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8886.52s)]
*  Always. 100% of the time. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8887.28s)]
*  And it always leads into a bunch of people getting hurt. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8888.56s)]
*  And it's like rinse, cycle, repeat throughout history. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8891.16s)]
*  But this is one of the first times where educated, progressive people think of themselves as compassionate, [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8893.28s)]
*  are advocating censorship, which is so bizarre. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8899.800000000001s)]
*  It's the same people, actually. Same people, same argument that they made three years ago against him. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8903.08s)]
*  The Journal of American Archaeology, or the Society of American Archaeology, dedicated 27 pages in a journal three years ago [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8908.240000000002s)]
*  to attacking Hancock for his book, America, before. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8915.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8918.2s)]
*  Same accusations, same language, same people. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8918.68s)]
*  And then I think what happened was when his show comes out and it's got, you know, you're there, [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8922.560000000001s)]
*  I think Jordan Peterson was in one of the clips, and it just, I think it triggered some of the more maybe left-leaning publications [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8927.6s)]
*  to go and look for what are the arguments being made against this, and then that whole, all those talking points get amplified and boosted, [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8935.08s)]
*  and it becomes this much bigger thing. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8942.28s)]
*  Well, they're just terrified that they're losing control of the narrative. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8943.720000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's the big part of it. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8946.640000000001s)]
*  And that's the same problem they have with this podcast, the same problem they have with a lot of things. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8948.4s)]
*  It can become very popular that they can't control. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8952.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8954.880000000001s)]
*  They just hate the fact that people are just able to discuss things openly and freely without them being in control of it [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8955.240000000002s)]
*  and getting all their greasy fucking fingers all over stuff. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8961.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8963.800000000001s)]
*  It's unfortunate in more ways than one because historically it always leads to like a terrible abyss of oblivion, [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8964.6s)]
*  and they never stop. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8972.12s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8974.08s)]
*  Once they start going after tyrannical control, historically it seems like it just never ever stops until someone stops them. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8974.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, which is scary. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8981.119999999999s)]
*  It is. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8983.119999999999s)]
*  It is scary. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8983.679999999998s)]
*  But the reality is that I look at this topic, you know, there's a niche community there into the ancients, [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8984.72s)]
*  and whether it's archaeologists that disagree with everything we just said or other people that agree with everything Graham Hancock says, [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8990.119999999999s)]
*  this is a win-win for everybody. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8996.119999999999s)]
*  I think this is an opportunity for people to unite under a common interest and then start exploring these topics. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=8998.16s)]
*  For example, if I had won the lottery, I would have hired a bunch of archaeologists that are the biggest naysayers [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9003.599999999999s)]
*  of anything that's alternative and be like, hey, here's a salary, let's get some blocks and then start cutting this stuff and moving it and just experiment. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9010.32s)]
*  And it's a win-win for everybody. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9018.52s)]
*  We'll learn something new. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9020.28s)]
*  They wouldn't engage. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9020.84s)]
*  They wouldn't engage with you. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9021.92s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the problems that Graham has with his detractors. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9022.96s)]
*  They say they'll debate him, but then when he offers them to debate him, they scurry away and hide. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9026.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9031.72s)]
*  Because I think they all kind of know, and I don't think they're necessary anymore. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9032.12s)]
*  Thanks to people like you guys who have really just examined all of the actual evidence without any biases or any sort of [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9036.480000000001s)]
*  ulterior motive and any narrative that you're trying to promote. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9045.32s)]
*  You're just looking at it going, what is this? [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9048.76s)]
*  This is wild stuff. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9050.960000000001s)]
*  And because of the fact that you guys exist on these platforms like YouTube, where you can get millions and millions of views. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9052.4s)]
*  I mean, there are no mainstream archaeologists that are getting millions of views on their stuff. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9059.640000000001s)]
*  That's why they're better envious and jealous. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9066.16s)]
*  It does drive them crazy. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9068.52s)]
*  They actually talk about it in some of these articles. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9069.720000000001s)]
*  It should. They suck. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9071.76s)]
*  You suck at distribution of information and you're ignoring the most interesting stuff. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9072.960000000001s)]
*  You know, when you're looking at the evidence of Atlantis or if you're looking at these similar construction methods that exist all over the world, [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9079.28s)]
*  like how? What the fuck is the real truth here? [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9087.24s)]
*  This is what's so interesting. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9091.48s)]
*  So a lot of people criticize us or Graham Hancock, like you're not archaeologists, you're not historians, you can't be trusted. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9092.68s)]
*  But I'm like, having outside eyes come in is so important. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9097.64s)]
*  Let me give you a quick little example I share with Ben the other day. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9101.4s)]
*  So I came from Target. I was investigating fraud with them, busting employees that stole from the company. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9103.8s)]
*  And there was a story that one of the executives spoke in front of us when I was an intern. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9108.72s)]
*  And at that time, this is like 2013, Walmart was amping up their online presence to compete with Amazon. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9113.039999999999s)]
*  And as the story goes, they hired some executive from Pepsi. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9120.24s)]
*  Pepsi is far more than a soda company. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9123.4s)]
*  It is a distributor, if it's anything. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9125.4s)]
*  They move product from point A to point B. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9127.36s)]
*  And when this as the story goes, this executive came in and on day one saw something, [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9129.44s)]
*  some opportunity for improvement that made significant changes with Walmart's ability to compete with Amazon in their online presence. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9134.68s)]
*  And it's because when you have other people coming in from outside the box, [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9142.199999999999s)]
*  whether it's Ben coming from the tech industry and having patents with HP. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9145.44s)]
*  Should I drop? Like some pretty cool stuff. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9148.84s)]
*  You know, here I was a number of years ago watching Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson on the Joe Rogan podcast. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9152.359999999999s)]
*  And I remember like going down the rabbit hole scene like, OK, let me let me see if there's some truth to these these alternative theories involving bronze chisels. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9158.759999999998s)]
*  Is this feasible? Is it not? [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9166.84s)]
*  And so I'm convinced that any reasonably intelligent person that simply looks at all points on any side of it can see like, OK, you know, there is something here. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9168.519999999999s)]
*  There is a mystery here. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9176.72s)]
*  And going back to Graham Hancock and ancient apocalypse, with all the criticism he's getting, [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9178.160000000002s)]
*  I don't hear anybody advocating for exploring the meanie road. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9182.720000000001s)]
*  I don't hear anyone asking to excavate the twenty five thousand year old chamber in Indonesia. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9187.160000000002s)]
*  I don't hear anyone talking about anything in the show. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9193.28s)]
*  Here's what's really cool. No one's paying attention as archaeologists. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9197.12s)]
*  There's so many more people that are watching the show. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9200.560000000001s)]
*  Millions of people are watching the show. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9202.880000000001s)]
*  And like how many thousands of people have heard the arguments these archaeologists are having? [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9204.92s)]
*  It's it's it's a blip. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9209.08s)]
*  It's it's literally they're like yelling into the abyss and no one's listening to them. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9210.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. The nature of the discourse has changed in a lot of ways. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9215.32s)]
*  I mean, it's it has. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9218.6s)]
*  I mean, just having a fucking look. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9220.12s)]
*  Human beings have accumulated knowledge and information over time. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9223.32s)]
*  And the idea that there's gatekeepers to knowledge and information that they have to come from these accredited universities, [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9226.960000000001s)]
*  which are now being widely discredited because of all their wacky social ideas and all the crazy shit that people. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9233.16s)]
*  It's not necessary. There's just information and the what's what's happening right now with the Internet is that your it's over. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9239.64s)]
*  Use the the actual amount of information is so overwhelming. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9248.48s)]
*  The idea that one group controls the access to information or what is legitimate about that information. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9253.679999999998s)]
*  It's not true anymore because there's so many like random people that are experts and that have accumulated vast amounts of data. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9261.480000000001s)]
*  And like you, you can just pull it off the top of your head. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9270.28s)]
*  You don't even have any fucking notes you're drawing from. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9272.720000000001s)]
*  And you're talking about all this different stuff. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9274.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, how many archaeologists can do that? [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9276.560000000001s)]
*  It's like and how many archaeologists do it about these very specific aspects of this stuff, [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9278.28s)]
*  which is so confusing and is not being discussed in the mainstream. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9284.04s)]
*  Right. Right. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9288.400000000001s)]
*  I am optimistic that I see comments on my channel and you get it as well. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9289.240000000002s)]
*  There's people saying I'm going to go study archaeology so I can explore these alternative topics. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9293.28s)]
*  I think there's going to be a lot of that. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9297.320000000002s)]
*  I'm sure there's been contacted by students, people that I think what's happening is is that they're being because this stuff is out there and it's it's becoming more mainstream. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9299.04s)]
*  They're being forced to deal with the arguments that are being raised by guys like Graham. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9307.36s)]
*  Like you have to go and account for the evidence. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9311.08s)]
*  You can't just dismiss it, which is kind of the prior generation of the old guys in the old guard. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9313.52s)]
*  Now, that's a lot of the approach they've taken. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9318.64s)]
*  But I'm hopeful also that, yeah, that because some of these students have said that who will be the establishment academics of the of the of the future and potentially also in charge of the textbooks and whatever the official story. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9321.359999999999s)]
*  The old guard will die off. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9333.32s)]
*  They will. That's really how it is with everything. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9334.599999999999s)]
*  Planks. Yeah. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9337.0s)]
*  Science advances one funeral at a time. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9337.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9339.279999999999s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9339.92s)]
*  It's sad. Yeah. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9341.359999999999s)]
*  It's not, though. It's kind of fun. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9342.72s)]
*  It's kind of hilarious. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9344.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's like it's it's really amazing. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9345.439999999999s)]
*  It's amazing that there's access to people like you now that you guys have these platforms like YouTube where you can just put these videos out and your videos have fucking millions of users. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9348.16s)]
*  So yours. It's amazing. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9358.16s)]
*  It's really cool. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9359.84s)]
*  I'm very grateful. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9360.84s)]
*  And I want to give a plug real quick to rumble. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9362.0s)]
*  I've been working with rumble. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9364.76s)]
*  I've asked anyone who's following me, go follow me on rumble. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9365.96s)]
*  I've been working and talking to their their team over there. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9368.52s)]
*  And these people are serious about promoting free speech and and having alternatives that are being suppressed elsewhere on their platform. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9371.160000000002s)]
*  And so I am about free speech. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9378.560000000001s)]
*  I don't care if people disagree with someone. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9380.52s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9382.880000000001s)]
*  But don't censor people. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9384.12s)]
*  So all that said, YouTube has been very good to me and I want to be on there forever. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9385.2s)]
*  But hey, I'll go. I need to diversify. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9389.2s)]
*  And I encourage anyone that's into my work to follow me there. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9391.720000000001s)]
*  Ben, you're on there as well. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9394.92s)]
*  On rumble as well. Yeah. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9395.92s)]
*  Yeah. No, I think it's fantastic that rumble exists. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9396.6s)]
*  And the Russell Brand is over there now. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9399.039999999999s)]
*  And there's just so many journalists who've started to do stuff over there. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9400.96s)]
*  It's great. I love it. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9405.32s)]
*  Because I can channel Adam Curry for a minute and talk about when you talk about the Internet and access to information outside of establishments. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9406.8s)]
*  One of the dangers I do see in it is the fact that we now the Internet kind of gets distilled down to these portals. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9412.439999999999s)]
*  Everyone looks at it through a portal, whether that's a Google search or a Facebook or a social media engine. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9417.96s)]
*  You could set up your own website outside of that. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9423.199999999999s)]
*  But the trick is how people are going to see it and go and look at it. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9425.08s)]
*  So I do see there are some efforts and I came from that background. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9428.320000000002s)]
*  You hinted at it. I've worked in data center and cloud and all of that for a long time. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9431.400000000001s)]
*  And it's just like this that control of that of that information is eventually going to come down to the stuff we're seeing with the Twitter files now where it's like, hey, we need to deamplify these things. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9435.92s)]
*  The Twitter files are wild. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9445.24s)]
*  They are unbelievably wild. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9446.76s)]
*  Wild. Yeah. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9448.16s)]
*  The stuff that Schellenberger's released and Matt Taibbi and all these different people that have gone over that Barry Weiss gone over this data and like crazy. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9448.76s)]
*  It's the government has had their fucking greasy fingers in all aspects of it. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9457.16s)]
*  Yeah. What have the conspiracies been wrong about in the last few years? [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9463.24s)]
*  Every well, that was Elon was joking around about that on one of the podcasts that he was on, where it's like every single one of them was right. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9467.24s)]
*  Right. Every single conspiracy theory about shadow banning, about, you know, lying about information, all of it. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9474.0s)]
*  It's got to the point now. Six months is the difference. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9480.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's at the point now you can you can figure out so quickly on who is not doing any research whatsoever. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9483.6s)]
*  And this will sound crass, but I'm just going to say it because I know it's the truth. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9490.16s)]
*  Most people are getting their news and information while they're sitting on the toilet, scrolling through social media and just scanning headlines. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9492.92s)]
*  Yes. And that's it. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9499.12s)]
*  And now me, my wife always accuses me of that because I'll send her something. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9500.800000000001s)]
*  She like, did you read it? No, you read it. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9505.640000000001s)]
*  I sent you the headline. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9507.880000000001s)]
*  Do you not see the headline? [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9509.320000000002s)]
*  Headlines. Terrifying. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9510.44s)]
*  Read that. Tell me what happens. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9512.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's at the point now people have to start, you know, this is what you do. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9513.72s)]
*  Like I remember during I hate to bring it up, but the covid stuff. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9517.72s)]
*  And I remember watching every when it was first kicking off and they were doing the White House press conferences every single day. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9520.28s)]
*  And I was listening to every single one of them. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9524.88s)]
*  And I started to see extremely quickly that all these Trump would say something and then all these headlines would show up minutes later and contradict what he was saying. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9526.64s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, this is awesome. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9534.72s)]
*  Everyone's going to see very quickly that like, you know, the mainstream with their little headlines are so inaccurate. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9536.039999999999s)]
*  That's not what happened. That's not what happened at all. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9542.2s)]
*  In fact, what it showed me is that most people are getting all their information from mainstream headlines. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9544.08s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they counted on that. Right. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9548.0s)]
*  I mean, when CNN was going after me for taking horse dewormer, they were counting on this idea that they had this control of the narrative. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9551.08s)]
*  But they didn't understand that I had already achieved like an escape velocity by that time, where I had 10 times as many people as them. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9559.4s)]
*  So I was like, what the fuck are these people doing? [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9565.96s)]
*  And then it just discredited them further. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9567.68s)]
*  Right. And literally was was doing the opposite. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9569.52s)]
*  They would hope it was doing right. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9573.6s)]
*  It's full. Well, it's because it's there's a difference between true and false. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9575.720000000001s)]
*  Right and wrong. Good versus evil. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9579.04s)]
*  I genuinely believe this. And truth always comes out. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9580.560000000001s)]
*  People people can be had. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9583.4s)]
*  It's easy to lie and fool people. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9585.28s)]
*  But if you continue to lie, that one lie creates five more and those five lives create 25. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9587.92s)]
*  And then before you know it, it's out of control and you can't keep up with it. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9593.32s)]
*  Yeah, but counter the Soviet Union or what's currently Russia right now, if you have control, the narrative, you can hold on to that control for a long fucking time. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9596.240000000002s)]
*  And this is why Elon is so dangerous to the to the establishment, because all of a sudden you have one major platform that's not controlled by the government. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9604.92s)]
*  In fact, when Joe Biden was tweeting shit that's inaccurate, Twitter was fact checking him. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9615.12s)]
*  Like, actually, that's not true at all. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9620.28s)]
*  This is what you said about the economy is bullshit. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9621.84s)]
*  And this and like, wow. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9624.119999999999s)]
*  And the government's deleting tweets, which is crazy to see. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9625.839999999998s)]
*  It's disturbing. Let me let's give Elon Musk a shout out. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9629.8s)]
*  The best thing I've ever done was pay my eight dollars. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9632.119999999999s)]
*  And now it's eleven dollars a month for my blue checkmark on Twitter. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9634.48s)]
*  I've exploded on there since I'm getting far more visibility. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9637.199999999999s)]
*  Best move ever. Freedom of speech. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9641.4s)]
*  Thank you, Elon. I will gladly, gladly send you another eleven dollars next month. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9643.0s)]
*  When he even started talking about buying Twitter, just in the process of that, I think they must have released a bunch of shadow bands. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9647.08s)]
*  And my shit went up nine hundred thousand Twitter subscribers or Twitter followers in like a couple of weeks. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9657.4s)]
*  Wow. I was like, this is nuts. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9664.32s)]
*  Yeah. And now it goes up organically. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9666.08s)]
*  I'm like, oh, this is what it's normal. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9668.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's normal. This is like what it's supposed to be. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9670.4s)]
*  But during the time I was dangerous. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9672.56s)]
*  Yeah. Dangerous. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9674.6s)]
*  And then he got a rat meat. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9675.720000000001s)]
*  Hold him down. He's dangerous. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9677.56s)]
*  Who allowed this? [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9680.640000000001s)]
*  The funniest part is all those people that dropped five thousand dollars, ten thousand dollars, fifteen thousand dollars. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9681.880000000001s)]
*  I've even heard of numbers of twenty thousand dollars that people paid for a blue checkmark just a few years ago. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9686.36s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9691.24s)]
*  People were buying their way in. People were doing this. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9692.44s)]
*  They were bribing people? Yeah. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9693.880000000001s)]
*  Who were they bribing? The people that work there. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9695.16s)]
*  They're making they're making money on the side. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9696.68s)]
*  The same thing was going down to Instagram. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9698.12s)]
*  And then apparently Zuckerberg, he shut that down. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9699.76s)]
*  Which, by the way, why I don't care about social media, but that I don't have a blue checkmark on Instagram and I don't know what it's going to take to get one because this would allow me to DM people. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9703.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9712.439999999999s)]
*  You get contact. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9713.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, maybe you can get me off the shadow band list, too. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9714.64s)]
*  There's something going on. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9717.199999999999s)]
*  Like I used to get way more subscribers per day. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9718.039999999999s)]
*  Like something happened like a year and a half ago. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9721.439999999999s)]
*  It happened to me, too. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9723.68s)]
*  I just hit a wall. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9725.439999999999s)]
*  But the conspiracy is that it's a shadow band. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9727.16s)]
*  But there's also a possibility that it's like it's favoring certain things like reels. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9730.44s)]
*  Right. It seems to favor reels now more than everything else, which is like very odd. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9736.68s)]
*  Do you want to know why? [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9741.640000000001s)]
*  Why? So they are they let me let me word this carefully. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9743.04s)]
*  The bad people, the evils, the dictators, the rulers, the elites. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9746.36s)]
*  Who? This is they are conditioning the human mind to be far more of a short attention span. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9750.240000000002s)]
*  So like Tick Tock, as an example, you are people can't even focus on anything [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9759.36s)]
*  that's longer than a minute or even 10 seconds. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9764.6s)]
*  They're scrolling through and they're not able. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9767.6s)]
*  It is conditioning people to pay attention less. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9769.88s)]
*  I don't think it's an accident. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9772.24s)]
*  And you could just look could be an easy way of making money. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9773.44s)]
*  And that might be the most simple thing. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9775.52s)]
*  It's an easy way of making money, because here's the counter to that. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9776.72s)]
*  This podcast. Right. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9780.36s)]
*  It's hours long hours. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9782.56s)]
*  Yeah, but it's the most watched. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9785.279999999999s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9786.96s)]
*  But it's hours long. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9788.12s)]
*  And a lot of people watch the whole fucking thing. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9789.64s)]
*  Or listen to the whole fucking thing. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9792.16s)]
*  Like it's a lot. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9793.6s)]
*  So it's like the opposite of what we thought. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9795.68s)]
*  We thought that people aren't interested in learning things. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9798.4s)]
*  They're not interested in exploring new ideas. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9800.8s)]
*  They're not interested in long form conversations. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9802.68s)]
*  They want things to be quick. Right. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9804.8s)]
*  Like that was when I first started doing it. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9806.48s)]
*  People were going, you got to edit this. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9807.8s)]
*  I was like, why? Like it's too long. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9809.24s)]
*  So don't listen. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9811.24s)]
*  Like I was like, this is what I'm interested in. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9812.44s)]
*  I'm just going to do what I'm interested in. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9814.6s)]
*  And it worked. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9816.28s)]
*  But it's the opposite of the narrative. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9817.6s)]
*  The narrative is everything has to be 10 seconds long. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9820.199999999999s)]
*  Tick tock. Keep going. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9822.36s)]
*  And we're just turning people into zombies. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9823.8s)]
*  Well, then that that goes back. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9825.6s)]
*  That verifies what I'm saying or validate. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9826.88s)]
*  So it's like true and false. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9828.56s)]
*  If they're going to put something out in short, you know, it's not working. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9830.36s)]
*  Right. I mean, it might be working in some capacity on some people. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9833.72s)]
*  But what's a new report highlights the decline of Facebook and Instagram [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9836.48s)]
*  as tick tock becomes the new home of entertainment. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9841.44s)]
*  Oh, my God. You need to get advertising. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9844.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, it should be illegal. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9845.84s)]
*  They should fucking ban it. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9847.64s)]
*  And it's like it's total Chinese spyware. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9848.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And everyone is like, I'm on time. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9852.84s)]
*  I don't even care. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9855.0s)]
*  Look at my go into my accounts and find out my passwords. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9856.0s)]
*  Yeah. Passwords. Absolutely everything. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9860.2s)]
*  It's more than just your credit card number, people. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9861.92s)]
*  It's literally every single thing in your phone. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9863.72s)]
*  Every website you search, all the text messages you make, it tracks [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9865.8s)]
*  all of the movements that you make with your thumb. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9870.52s)]
*  Everything. Yeah. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9873.8s)]
*  There's a saying, oh, but it's free. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9875.0s)]
*  It's fun. It's lovely. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9876.84s)]
*  And there's a saying anything that's if something's free, [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9877.84s)]
*  you are the product, right? [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9881.4s)]
*  Data, your data is the product. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9883.28s)]
*  But it's never been exploited like it is with tick tock. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9885.08s)]
*  And it's not they also lied about where the data is going. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9887.92s)]
*  Oh, it's only staying here in North America. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9890.92s)]
*  Bullshit. It's going straight to China. Right. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9893.08s)]
*  It's crazy. And they're they're also getting biometric data [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9895.32s)]
*  from people that have fingerprint readers on their phones or faced, [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9897.92s)]
*  you know, face recognition. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9901.4s)]
*  It's like there's so much data. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9902.92s)]
*  It's getting it's really spooky. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9904.88s)]
*  It is spooky. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9906.519999999999s)]
*  And in this world that we live in, when they're controlling information, [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9907.4s)]
*  the one thing that freaks me out about talking about history [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9909.96s)]
*  is that they usually they as in people who are tyrants [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9912.56s)]
*  that that that suppress and censor people throughout history, [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9916.0s)]
*  they go after the teachers. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9919.279999999999s)]
*  Mm hmm. They're on there. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9921.08s)]
*  It's more than just artists. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9922.64s)]
*  They'll go after the comedians. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9923.88s)]
*  They'll go after the teachers. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9924.96s)]
*  And because it's going to be complete control at a certain point [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9926.16s)]
*  where it's like you do not get to teach. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9928.439999999999s)]
*  We were talking about this last night at dinner about how [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9930.56s)]
*  what's her face down there in New Zealand? [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9933.119999999999s)]
*  Like anything just into our den, which you say anyone other than the government [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9934.76s)]
*  giving you information is false. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9938.24s)]
*  What was her? [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9939.44s)]
*  Oh, the prime minister of New Zealand. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9939.84s)]
*  Yeah, at some point, she's that lady's a creep. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9941.48s)]
*  Just into it. Yeah, isn't she? Yeah, she really is. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9943.32s)]

*  They seem benign. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9963.88s)]
*  And then Covid came along in this opportunity to control people [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9965.279999999999s)]
*  and a reason to do so. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9968.199999999999s)]
*  We're all in danger and they exaggerate that danger greatly [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9969.839999999998s)]
*  and use it to clamp down on you and force you into these pharmaceutical [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9973.359999999999s)]

*  I thought you were just governors and mayors and shit. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9990.64s)]
*  And shut down all the restaurants, even if it doesn't make any sense. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9993.8s)]
*  Yeah, we were even we were my wife and I were talking for a little bit about [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=9997.039999999999s)]

*  I'm not getting into it. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10026.16s)]
*  But what they did to Kerry Lake, I shouldn't go there. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10027.08s)]
*  But there's Arizona was the last free place or one of them [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10029.32s)]
*  because like Texas is debatable. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10033.72s)]
*  Florida is pretty free. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10035.2s)]
*  South Dakota is free. But Arizona, something [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10037.28s)]
*  everyone needs to be paying attention to what happened there. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10040.56s)]
*  Yeah, the irregularities when it came to the reports [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10042.48s)]
*  that people had at the places where they were trying to vote is really wild. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10046.960000000001s)]
*  Like, I wish I knew what was true so I could actually comment on it. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10051.04s)]
*  My what I witnessed walking my dog in different neighborhoods [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10055.080000000002s)]
*  was a lot of Kerry Lake signs. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10058.400000000001s)]
*  And I didn't see one single one of Hobbs [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10059.92s)]
*  and Katie Hobbs, like her social media on Instagram, [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10063.12s)]
*  I like 6000 followers, like literally on the election night [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10065.92s)]
*  compared to Kerry Lakes, like 300000. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10069.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, that means something. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10071.800000000001s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily prove anything. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10074.240000000002s)]
*  But my point is that people I was talking to, she had a huge, huge, huge following. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10075.720000000001s)]
*  She was doing all the debates. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10080.12s)]
*  Katie Hobbs hid. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10081.320000000002s)]
*  But I know what happened. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10083.240000000002s)]
*  I mean, I don't have proof. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10086.880000000001s)]
*  What do you think happened? [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10088.12s)]
*  Are you allowed to say these things? Right. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10090.0s)]
*  These are the things that they go like this to you. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10091.320000000002s)]
*  If you go, you know what I mean? [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10092.92s)]
*  This is like one of those things for you. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10093.76s)]
*  They go like this to you. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10095.08s)]
*  You think there was some manipulation that led to someone else winning? [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10095.68s)]
*  Perhaps. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10101.44s)]
*  You'd have to be stupid not to conclude that. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10102.960000000001s)]
*  If anyone that's looked into this, you would have it's an insult. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10105.08s)]
*  It's insulting my intelligence to think that something. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10108.4s)]
*  Let me just say it like this. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10111.84s)]
*  I just have some questions. That's all. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10113.199999999999s)]
*  Well, all the people that were it was at Maricopa County. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10114.6s)]
*  Yes. The area where they had the most irregularities were also the most Republicans. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10117.64s)]
*  Yes. Well, I mean, Maricopa County has a lot of blue to it, too. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10122.48s)]
*  But listen, Trump has provided no evidence to support her claims of election fraud. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10125.88s)]
*  This is on Newsweek.com, which is totally unbiased. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10130.96s)]
*  No evidence. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10133.64s)]
*  Even her legal case was thrown out by a Maricopa County judge in December. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10134.72s)]
*  Lake has insisted that the election fraud was involved in Hobbs [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10138.88s)]
*  declared victory and that she's the real governor. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10142.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10146.0s)]
*  But she was also saying that Donald Trump really won and he was the real [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10147.8s)]
*  real president. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10152.0s)]
*  Well, what she said, it's said almost every election. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10152.96s)]
*  That they carry like I studied Carey Lake. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10155.199999999999s)]
*  Let me quote her because I'm a I'm a you carry like supporter, bro. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10157.52s)]
*  Yes. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10161.0s)]
*  I am a supporter of anyone that's an advocate for free speech, [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10162.44s)]
*  anti censorship and freedom and my rights. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10165.24s)]
*  And what she said, a reporter asked her was pressing her on the 2020 [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10168.04s)]
*  election involving Donald Trump. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10171.76s)]
*  And she said it very eloquently. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10173.12s)]
*  She said she has to report. I'm asking you, [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10174.800000000001s)]
*  do you really think that Joe Biden got 81 million votes? [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10177.52s)]
*  And the report is like, do you think so? [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10181.800000000001s)]
*  She's like, no, I'm just asking you. Do you think he did? [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10182.92s)]
*  She's like, I have questions and so do Arizonans. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10184.880000000001s)]
*  And that's all I'm saying. I just have some questions. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10187.0s)]
*  I'm allowed to ask questions. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10189.28s)]
*  I think a lot of people voted for Joe Biden. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10190.28s)]
*  Would a lot of people vote again? I don't think so. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10192.24s)]
*  And I think that's why they're looking into his fucking classified documents [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10194.28s)]
*  that he got in the backseat of his Corvette. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10197.960000000001s)]
*  Maybe the Democrats think that, too. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10200.84s)]
*  They're trying to sink that dude. Yeah. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10202.2s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't know jack shit about politics. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10203.880000000001s)]
*  And I'm a little suspicious of their actions. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10206.6s)]
*  I can't even vote. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10210.0s)]
*  Hey, I'm good. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10210.84s)]
*  I think Atlantis, I think Atlantis is in the Sahara Africa. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10212.480000000001s)]
*  So just I don't know anything about politics either. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10215.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And Elon Musk, let's excavate the lost labyrinth of Egypt. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10218.56s)]
*  Well, the problem, I mean, I think one of the problems with elections [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10221.76s)]
*  always is that you can never say there's zero fraud [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10226.96s)]
*  because like no one thinks there's zero fraud. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10231.32s)]
*  Like when you say how much election fraud is there? [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10234.199999999999s)]
*  It's not zero. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10238.56s)]
*  So what is the number and how much of it is Republican election fraud [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10239.88s)]
*  and how much of it is Democrat election fraud? [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10243.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10245.72s)]
*  You know, I really I remember they had that documentary on HBO [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10246.76s)]
*  back when Bush was president. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10250.4s)]
*  It was called Hacking Democracy, and it was all about the die [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10251.76s)]
*  bold voting system and that these voting systems have been manipulated [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10254.72s)]
*  to help the Republicans win. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10258.88s)]
*  So there's always been this sort of [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10260.039999999999s)]
*  this there's always been this narrative that, you know, [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10264.48s)]
*  your your elections are not fair. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10268.72s)]
*  And a lot of that is being reinforced by these troll sites, [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10272.119999999999s)]
*  these troll farms like in Macedonia. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10277.64s)]
*  They have a bunch of them in Russia. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10280.68s)]
*  And they've been doing that to try to undermine our faith in democracy forever. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10282.519999999999s)]
*  And so a lot of people, they get their information from these websites [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10286.8s)]
*  and Facebook pages that aren't even based in America. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10292.08s)]
*  And they're purely designed to get us upset at the election process [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10295.0s)]
*  and undermine our faith in the system. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10300.2s)]
*  And, you know, they found out that 20 out of the top 20 Facebook pages, [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10302.12s)]
*  that 19 of the top 20 were all Russian troll farms, [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10306.36s)]
*  which is what all the Christian sites, 19 of the top 20 Christian sites [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10311.16s)]
*  on Facebook were trolls. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10316.12s)]
*  And it's like they're doing this to try to get people upset about things. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10318.16s)]
*  It undermines our faith in democracy, creates more chaos, [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10321.52s)]
*  it makes us more easily manipulated. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10324.84s)]
*  It's really bad. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10327.240000000002s)]
*  And I really wish that we understood. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10328.24s)]
*  Look, if so many people thought that Joe Biden would be a great president. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10330.28s)]
*  Well, now, you know, now, you know, he's not. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10334.6s)]
*  And now, you know, he really was in mental decline. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10336.6s)]
*  And well, maybe you can make a better choice in 2024 and let's sort this out. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10339.88s)]
*  Right. But once soon as he said, I'm going to run again. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10343.56s)]
*  They're like, the fuck you are. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10346.68s)]
*  And then, you know, I think this is the beginning of a bunch of things [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10348.48s)]
*  that will probably come out. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10352.16s)]
*  Totally. They flipped on him. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10352.8s)]
*  And they'll turn on him. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10354.16s)]
*  And then they'll they'll put someone else in his place. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10355.52s)]
*  And do some waiting in the wings. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10357.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he's problematic because even they fucking hate him in California. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10359.28s)]
*  How are they how are they going to feel about him in Arizona? [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10364.12s)]
*  How they feel about him? [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10366.2s)]
*  But it's also it's like how how much of it can be manipulated by the media. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10367.6s)]
*  I mean, how much can people be manipulated by these headlines [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10373.52s)]
*  that you read while you're taking a shit? [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10376.2s)]
*  How much of it, you know, how much how much of these narratives can be shaped [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10377.68s)]
*  to get people to say, look, it's better than better him than Trump. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10382.24s)]
*  Yeah. If it's Trump, we're going to have a nuclear war. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10385.88s)]
*  Trump, we're going to have a this. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10387.88s)]
*  No, we're going to meet white supremacists. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10388.92s)]
*  We're going to have a this and that. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10390.72s)]
*  Mean tweets, Joe. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10392.16s)]
*  That's this focus of it's really important. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10393.0s)]
*  Back. Well, he can't even tweet anymore because he's got to deal with true social, [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10394.8s)]
*  it seems like, because they gave him his Twitter account back and he won't even use it. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10398.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think him and Musk are friends, I suspect. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10402.56s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's that. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10405.64s)]
*  I don't think he's allowed to. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10407.0s)]
*  I think he has a deal. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10409.08s)]
*  If I had to guess, this is pure speculation, [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10410.72s)]
*  but he has his own social media network and it's very valuable. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10413.279999999999s)]
*  Right. So the only way that truth social is valuable at all [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10417.28s)]
*  is if he's not using Twitter. I see. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10421.480000000001s)]
*  If he starts using Twitter, I mean, he has like 29 million Twitter followers [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10423.36s)]
*  or something crazy like that. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10426.36s)]
*  If he starts using that, no one's going to pay attention to true social. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10427.400000000001s)]
*  Like, why would I go over there and watch a bunch of QAnon wackos [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10430.44s)]
*  like scream about like pizza gate when when there's Twitter? [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10433.84s)]
*  I could just go to Twitter and read what he has to say [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10438.24s)]
*  and see him, you know, arguing with people. Right. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10441.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Taliban's on Twitter and they just bought blue check marks. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10443.44s)]
*  So people are mad that Trump is back on Twitter. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10447.44s)]
*  I mean, I saw people I'm leaving Twitter. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10450.12s)]
*  But do you understand the fucking Communist Party of China is on Twitter? [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10451.92s)]
*  Do you understand the Taliban's on Twitter? [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10455.28s)]
*  Do you understand how many fucking people are on Twitter? [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10457.08s)]
*  You're mad that Trump's back. Hypocrites. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10459.480000000001s)]
*  Well, it's just like when the guys on Twitter, he says funny shit. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10462.400000000001s)]
*  People can attack him and they can go after him. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10465.68s)]
*  That's what it's supposed to be. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10468.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be like he says something and then let someone from the left [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10469.320000000002s)]
*  let Elizabeth Warren go after him or let this person go after. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10473.28s)]
*  Let let him duke it out. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10477.24s)]
*  Don't fucking silence people. Right. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10478.56s)]
*  Especially like this idea that it's dangerous to let him speak and communicate. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10480.92s)]
*  What about you, motherfucker? [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10485.96s)]
*  Someone's going to say it's dangerous to have you speak. Yeah. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10487.52s)]
*  Yes. It's going to come down to it. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10490.28s)]
*  Like they're going to keep pushing it further and further and further [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10492.2s)]
*  until like you're going to have a very narrow window of communication, [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10494.6s)]
*  a very narrow lane of your ability to express yourself. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10498.96s)]
*  And it's not going to accurately represent people. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10502.44s)]
*  And they're going to whisper things in pubs. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10504.72s)]
*  And whisper things in coffee shops. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10506.92s)]
*  And that's going to be the real truth. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10508.64s)]
*  Yep. And this is like I was saying a few moments ago, which is that [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10510.24s)]
*  for decades throughout your life, people we didn't have the censorship. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10513.32s)]
*  People were allowed to say things. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10516.76s)]
*  A worst case scenario, they got ridiculed and laughed at and life went on. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10517.800000000001s)]
*  And everything was fine. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10520.72s)]
*  The merry-go-round of life worked out just fine with everyone being able to say [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10522.08s)]
*  whatever they want to say. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10525.68s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, it's a problem. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10527.32s)]
*  So they're conditioning the younger demographic to be like, you're right. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10529.4s)]
*  This is this is dangerous misinformation. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10532.84s)]
*  The younger demographic, these Gen Z's, they don't they don't remember [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10535.52s)]
*  what I remember before, like the days before 9-11 being a senior in high school [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10538.44s)]
*  when that went down and just how everything is slowly started changing since. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10541.88s)]
*  They don't understand that freedom of speech was always a thing. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10545.36s)]
*  There wasn't censorship and everything was fine. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10548.96s)]
*  And now they they censor and now you see problems. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10552.96s)]
*  Well, there's also the problem that social media, for the most part, [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10556.36s)]
*  is controlled by the left. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10559.88s)]
*  It's almost entirely owned and controlled by tech companies [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10561.720000000001s)]
*  who are very progressive and educated and primarily lean left. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10566.0s)]
*  They used to be the other way for a long time. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10569.720000000001s)]
*  The tech they blow with the wind a little bit in terms of political favor and [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10571.44s)]
*  right, but there's never been. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10575.880000000001s)]
*  But tech has always been different than social media. [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10576.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Tech combined with social media like that. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10580.16s)]
*  That form of tech is the distribution of information tech. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10583.6s)]
*  It's not tech like old school. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10586.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's so different. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10588.28s)]
*  Devin Nunes, the former California congressman who left office [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10591.080000000002s)]
*  to run Donald Trump's app, True Social, as we're being quiet [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10594.52s)]
*  as the platform continues to be plagued with issues. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10597.92s)]
*  His app. It's his Devin Nunes. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10600.6s)]
*  No, no. Donald Trump. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10602.84s)]
*  Like he owned like his company runs it. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10605.640000000001s)]
*  I think that scaling issues. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10608.52s)]
*  Well, I'm sure someone paid for it. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10609.960000000001s)]
*  I'm sure he didn't buy it. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10612.84s)]
*  Well, I was looking up the CEO is Devin Nunes [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10614.080000000002s)]
*  and Devin Nunes left to run Trump's like social media. Right. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10616.880000000001s)]
*  But do you think he funded it? [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10620.04s)]
*  I'm sure there has to be some sort of a deal. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10621.080000000002s)]
*  I would just imagine. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10623.400000000001s)]
*  Because I would imagine there's investors like say, if you're going to open up an app. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10625.36s)]
*  Look, those apps don't do well. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10629.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, think about Gab and think about a lot of these other ones [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10633.320000000002s)]
*  that they created getter. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10637.080000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of them they created. They just went away. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10638.800000000001s)]
*  The only I mean, if you got a fucking figurehead as big as Donald Trump [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10641.320000000002s)]
*  and he's banned from Twitter and he say this is the only way to get the voice [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10644.880000000001s)]
*  of the king and you put it on to social people can invest in that. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10648.4s)]
*  And if they're going to invest in that, they're going to be very hesitant. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10652.68s)]
*  Well, how do I know he's not going to go back to Twitter? [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10655.44s)]
*  Well, he was not allowed to. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10658.0s)]
*  I mean, that's just me guessing. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10660.359999999999s)]
*  I have no idea. Very logical. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10662.16s)]
*  Totally talking out of my ass. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10663.76s)]
*  But I would imagine that he has some sort of a deal. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10665.359999999999s)]
*  Also, I would imagine that if that is his company, he would be wise enough to go, [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10668.039999999999s)]
*  you know what, this is worth nothing if I go on to Twitter. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10672.039999999999s)]
*  So if I'm going to sell this one day and make a big profit. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10675.36s)]
*  Yeah. So you go. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10680.48s)]
*  There you go. Look at all these people. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10681.84s)]
*  Six point two million. That guy invested six point two million. [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10683.76s)]
*  Oh, my God. I want to sell you a bridge, buddy. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10687.039999999999s)]
*  Yes, they got a billion dollars secured. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10689.12s)]
*  I reported one billion dollars. Oh, my God. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10691.72s)]
*  It's worth forty dollars. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10694.52s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10697.48s)]
*  But the money remains inaccessible pending a successful public launch. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10699.0s)]
*  In the interim, Trump's media venture has put together about 38 million in debt, [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10702.44s)]
*  according to the SEC. That makes sense. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10707.28s)]
*  And that money didn't come from Trump himself. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10709.720000000001s)]
*  So who provided it? See, that's what I'm saying. [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10712.720000000001s)]
*  The money didn't come from Trump himself. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10715.12s)]
*  See, I guessed and I was correct. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10716.800000000001s)]
*  And so let's look at all these people. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10719.84s)]
*  So look at all these folks. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10722.36s)]
*  Karl Fluger. Hello, Karl, president of the Texas Oil Company. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10724.24s)]
*  I bet he has a big hat and a fucking giant belt buckle. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10728.2s)]
*  And he put 10 million dollars toward True Social. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10731.16s)]
*  Wow. It's a lot of money, Karl. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10733.92s)]

*  donated to Trump before, forked over forked over four million. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10745.92s)]
*  Wow. Jesus, people are all rich. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10750.24s)]
*  That guy, the next guy, only 200 grand and 100 grand. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10752.88s)]
*  So most of the people were like, yeah, they are rich. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10755.88s)]
*  But still, that is not a wise use of money. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10759.56s)]
*  You know, they probably got their way. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10766.119999999999s)]

*  was not even close. Yeah, that wasn't even 50. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10775.76s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the other people are probably hiding. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10777.6s)]
*  The other people are probably hiding. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10780.24s)]
*  Or maybe they got a lot of people that donated like a thousand. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10781.56s)]
*  You know, yeah, because they got so the next one like 200,000. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBekFQbwAGk&t=10784.16s)]
