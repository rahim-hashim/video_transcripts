# Joe Rogan Experience #1901 - Steven Pressfield
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6.0s)]
*  Good to see you, man. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10.56s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=13.44s)]
*  It's good to see you, Joe. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=14.44s)]
*  With a nice stack of books here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=15.44s)]
*  What do we got here? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=17.32s)]
*  Government cheese, a memoir? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=18.56s)]
*  Is this your memoir? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=19.84s)]
*  This is my memoir, yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=20.96s)]
*  Ah, exciting. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=22.96s)]
*  Of my 27 years in the wilderness. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=23.96s)]
*  And Put Your Ass Where Your Heart Wants To Be. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=27.64s)]
*  That's sort of like a war of art type of book, as you can tell from the size of it and everything. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=32.44s)]
*  After writing The War of Art, because you also wrote Turning Pro, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=37.32s)]
*  Yeah, and a few others. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=41.84s)]
*  Yeah, but on the same vein. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=43.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=46.6s)]
*  You just felt like you have more to squeeze out of that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=47.6s)]
*  It's like it's such an important subject for artists and for creative people. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=52.2s)]
*  I mean, that book, The War of Art, changed so many people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=56.08s)]
*  Let me ask you, Joe, why did that resonate with you? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=59.56s)]
*  Well, there was some stuff that you talked about that it was almost like unspoken. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=63.44s)]
*  And one of them is the concept of resistance. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=69.2s)]
*  And that the fact that you treated the muse as if it was like a real living entity. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  Which I think it is, yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=81.24s)]
*  She is. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=83.0s)]
*  She is. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=84.0s)]
*  There it is, that thing where if you show up and you put in the work, creativity just [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=85.0s)]
*  sort of gives birth. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=92.52s)]
*  It erupts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=96.44s)]
*  It comes out. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=97.88s)]
*  It manifests. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=99.0s)]
*  There's something to it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=100.88s)]
*  And I kind of always had this inkling that that was a thing or this thought that that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=101.88s)]
*  was a thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  Until I read your book, it was like you made it real. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  You laid it out and you're like, here's the problem. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=115.8s)]
*  This is what's going on and this is what you got to do. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=119.72s)]
*  You just got to show up every day and put in the work and be a damn professional. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  And so many people that I gave that book to, I used to have a stack of them in my old studio. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=127.32s)]
*  And I would just hand them to people. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  Dude, just read this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=133.84s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=135.04s)]
*  And it wasn't a hard read. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=136.44s)]
*  It wasn't a giant book. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=138.2s)]
*  But it was so valuable because it just like, I guarantee you, there's so many people, there [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=139.56s)]
*  were so many days where people sat in front of their computer or notepad where they wouldn't [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  have because of that book. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=151.48s)]
*  It got people to where they needed to go. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=153.6s)]
*  Whether they stayed there, whether they kept up the, that's not your... [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=156.12s)]
*  Did you yourself, let me ask you, like as a comic, did you experience resistance to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=160.6s)]
*  getting say up on front of people or in the writing of the material or... [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=166.64s)]
*  Yeah, you kind of... [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=171.56s)]
*  Was that an area where you could relate to it? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=172.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=175.64s)]
*  It all, all the above. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=176.64s)]
*  You could, you know, you experience resistance and like, oh, I want to take a day off. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=178.44s)]
*  You know, like, oh, I don't feel like going up today. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=182.28s)]
*  Like I know a lot of comics are really good comics and they're always canceling. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=184.16s)]
*  There's work and then there's spots. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=189.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=191.48s)]
*  Spots are important because the spots are what get you better, tighten your material [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  and how you create new material that keeps you sharp. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=199.64s)]
*  Now are spots when you actually perform, is that what a spot is? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  So this is what I mean. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  A spot is, say if you're going to go to the comedy store and on a regular night in the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  comedy store, there might be 15 comedians and each one of them is doing 15 minutes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=212.16s)]
*  So there's just, it's a long running show. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=218.04s)]
*  It starts from 8 p.m. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=220.32s)]
*  It goes on all night. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=221.56s)]
*  When you're doing that, that's a spot. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=223.88s)]
*  It doesn't pay very well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  I think it pays like $50. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=227.4s)]
*  So you just go down there and it's really, there's a lot of camaraderie. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=229.56s)]
*  We're all hanging around with each other and joking around in the parking lot and in the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=233.4s)]
*  hallway and you're really just trying to stay sharp and work on new material. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  And you might, in the comedy store, it has three rooms. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=242.24s)]
*  There's the belly room that seats about 70 to 90 people. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=245.0s)]
*  There's the main room that seats about 400 plus people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=249.88s)]
*  And then there's the original room that seats, I think it seats about 170. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=253.56s)]
*  And you do shows in each room. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  People do spots. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=262.52s)]
*  Sometimes people do three spots a night. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=263.52s)]
*  So those don't pay well. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=265.8s)]
*  But those are the ones people cancel. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=268.04s)]
*  So a lot of comedians, they're like, oh, I don't feel like going up. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=270.76s)]
*  And they'll call in the store, I'm canceling. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to cancel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=276.4s)]
*  I'm not feeling well. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=277.4s)]
*  I'll cancel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=278.4s)]
*  It's really just resistance. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  It's this thing that keeps you from showing up. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  But the resistance for writing is way stronger. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  That's really strong. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=287.56s)]
*  That's the work that you're talking about. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=288.56s)]
*  That's the spot and then the work. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, no, no. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  The spots are short sets that you do in town. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  Work is when you're on the road. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=297.02s)]
*  So the work is, say if you do a weekend at a comedy club. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=298.82s)]
*  Now that pays well. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  That's where the majority of comedians make their living is doing weekends on the road [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=304.53999999999996s)]
*  or maybe even weekdays on the road. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=309.12s)]
*  So then you're doing a show. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=312.2s)]
*  And the idea is that you've crafted all this material on your own in writing and then in [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=314.4s)]
*  front of the crowd doing spots and doing it around town. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  And then when you go on the road, then you have a show to put on. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=328.36s)]
*  And that's work. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=332.22s)]
*  What's interesting to me, here's my question. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=334.12s)]
*  When do you actually sit down and write the thing? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=336.56s)]
*  For me, it's two times. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=340.72s)]
*  It's either late at night when everyone's asleep in my house or lately it's been in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=342.16s)]
*  the morning. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=347.68s)]
*  Lately, I've been doing it first thing in the morning. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=348.68s)]
*  And there's, I don't know, sometimes I have my best ideas first thing in the morning for [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=351.72s)]
*  some reason. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=355.88s)]
*  And like, I can't quite imagine what is it like? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=356.88s)]
*  Do you have like a theme that you think is funny that you're going to work on? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=359.76s)]
*  No. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  I just sit in front of the computer and write about subjects. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=365.84s)]
*  I just have like essays. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=369.28s)]
*  See I used to try to just write jokes, but it seemed too limiting creatively. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=370.96s)]
*  Like the format is so limited that I was missing out on some ideas. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  And so then I started writing blog posts. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  And one of the things that I realized in blog, when I write blog, which is essentially essays, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  is that I can extract good ideas from those essays and those would become my bits. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=393.12s)]
*  And so now that's how I write. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=399.08000000000004s)]
*  When I write, I just sit down and I just like, I'm doing this idea about riots lately, riots [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=400.6s)]
*  and protests. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=409.12s)]
*  And so I just start writing about riots and protests. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=410.68s)]
*  And I'm just writing. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  And then I'm writing about what kind of people go and what motivates someone to put a buffalo [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=415.32000000000005s)]
*  hat on and try to break into the Capitol. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  And as I'm writing, then I'll go, that's a joke. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=423.04s)]
*  And I'll take that and I'll pull it out and I'll copy and paste it in another folder or [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=427.52s)]
*  another file. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=431.92s)]
*  And then I'll go on stage and try to like give those life. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=434.16s)]
*  And so then I take those and I try to figure out the best way to present them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=439.72s)]
*  And oftentimes like you think you have it right, but then you go in front of the crowd [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=443.72s)]
*  and they don't think it's funny. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=448.88s)]
*  Or they think the setup is funny, but the punchline sucks. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=454.36s)]
*  Or they think, you know, maybe the way they laugh makes you think there's another layer [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=455.36s)]
*  to this and you come up with more stuff on the fly. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=462.72s)]
*  So you really create in front of them as well as by yourself. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=467.12s)]
*  You need them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=471.16s)]
*  Like, you know, you can't create comedy in a vacuum. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=472.16s)]
*  You really need an audience. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=475.56s)]
*  What's the feeling like when you're on stage? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=477.16s)]
*  Are you scared? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=479.24s)]
*  Is it fun? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=480.32s)]
*  No, it's fun. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=481.32s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=482.32s)]
*  Maybe it would be scary if I hadn't done it a lot. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=483.32s)]
*  It was definitely scary when I first started doing it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=486.28s)]
*  But now it's fun. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=489.0s)]
*  It's just fun. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=490.0s)]
*  Like they're all paying to see you. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=491.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=492.0s)]
*  It's a good time. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=493.0s)]
*  As long as you've done the work, that's, you know, as long as you're prepared, it shouldn't [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=494.0s)]
*  be scary. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=497.8s)]
*  It should be really a good time. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=498.8s)]
*  You're there to make them laugh. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=499.8s)]
*  You know, but it's, but I've also been doing it 33 years, you know, 34 years. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=501.68s)]
*  It's a long ass time. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=507.88s)]
*  I mean, I know that my accountant always tells me that his comedians are he they all write [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=509.6s)]
*  off their psychotherapy bills. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=516.08s)]
*  In other words, he's saying to me that these are the ones that it's not easy being a comic. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=517.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=522.92s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=526.68s)]
*  You seem like you enjoy it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=527.68s)]
*  It is fun. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=528.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's different. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=529.68s)]
*  I mean, what does that mean? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=531.56s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=532.8s)]
*  It's not easy being a soldier. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=533.8s)]
*  OK, it's not easy being an EMT. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=534.8s)]
*  It's not easy being a police officer. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=537.28s)]
*  It's not easy being a schoolteacher in an inner city school. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  It's not easy being a heart surgeon. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=542.48s)]
*  Comedy is not that fucking hard. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=546.92s)]
*  There's this old expression, the hardest, I don't know who the fuck said this, but I've [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=549.4s)]
*  repeated it ad nauseum. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=552.48s)]
*  The hardest thing that's ever happened to you is the hardest thing that's ever happened [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=554.28s)]
*  to you, or the worst thing that's ever happened to you is the worst thing that's ever happened [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  to you. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  And that worst thing could be you're a little kid and your toy breaks. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  Or it could be your family got killed in a war. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=566.28s)]
*  It really depends. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=569.52s)]
*  And so what level of resilience you have is entirely dependent upon what your life experiences [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=571.24s)]
*  are and what you've come to expect. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=577.6s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that are comedians that really seem to think that what they're [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=579.96s)]
*  doing is so goddamn difficult. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=584.36s)]
*  And yeah, it's not the easiest thing in the world, but Jesus Christ, what a great life. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=587.22s)]
*  You're telling jokes. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=593.04s)]
*  You're making people laugh. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=594.28s)]
*  It should be wonderful and celebrated. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=595.6s)]
*  But a lot of them, they do a really poor job of mental management and of assessing their [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=598.88s)]
*  own psychological issues and coming up with real methods of mitigation. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  So why do people bail out on the nights that they're not... [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=611.32s)]
*  Resistance. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=616.0400000000001s)]
*  They're afraid of bombing? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=617.0400000000001s)]
*  They're afraid of getting up there and... [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  No, they're just not being pros. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=621.72s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why your book resonated so much. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=623.68s)]
*  It's because there's a thing that you described that you just nailed it and you called it [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  resistance. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=632.76s)]
*  But there's this feeling that you just don't want to sit and write. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=633.76s)]
*  You don't want to work. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=637.92s)]
*  When I get in front of my computer, there's an urge, like, hey, let's go see what's in [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  YouTube. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  Hey, let's go work and roam around. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  Let's go to dig.com, see what the wackiest stories are. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=648.04s)]
*  Let's go to CNN. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=651.0999999999999s)]
*  That is part of the resistance. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=652.1s)]
*  It keeps you from just sitting down and working. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=656.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what that is because you know in the back of your head that if you do the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=659.82s)]
*  work you'll have more ideas. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=663.82s)]
*  If you have more ideas, you'll have more material. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=665.66s)]
*  If you have more material, you'll be able to pick the best material and your show will [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=667.5400000000001s)]
*  be better and then the audience will have a better time, your career will go better [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=671.46s)]
*  and all these things. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=675.34s)]
*  And yet that doesn't matter. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=676.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=677.98s)]
*  You still feel it, right? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=678.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=679.98s)]
*  It's universal, I can tell you, from the emails that I get, from the letters that I get. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=681.34s)]
*  Not only is it universal and everybody experiences it, but they all seem to experience it with [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=685.94s)]
*  the same script. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=690.94s)]
*  You're not worthy, you're too old, too young, too fat, too thin, whatever. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=693.66s)]
*  Or let's do something else. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=698.86s)]
*  Let's distract ourselves with something else. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=700.58s)]
*  So everybody gets the same thing. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=703.1800000000001s)]
*  I always say that it's a force of nature. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=704.74s)]
*  It's not personal. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=710.82s)]
*  It's not specific to you, even though that voice in your head sounds like it is specific [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=713.5s)]
*  to you. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=718.86s)]
*  It's saying, Joe, and then it's hitting you right in the points that are your sore points, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=719.86s)]
*  you know? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=723.38s)]
*  But it's really not personal. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=724.38s)]
*  Everybody seems to experience the same thing. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=726.0200000000001s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=729.62s)]
*  When did you write The War of Art? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=730.62s)]
*  2002. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=732.4200000000001s)]
*  And in that time after writing that, I'm sure it's obviously been a very successful book. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=733.4200000000001s)]
*  So you've had time to think about this. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=739.9s)]
*  What do you think is going on? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=743.78s)]
*  Why is that a force of nature? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=746.6999999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=748.06s)]
*  This is my lengthy explanation, but I'll give you my theory. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=749.74s)]
*  If we think of the human, bear with me, this takes a minute or two. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=754.3s)]
*  If you think of the human psyche, we got the ego, which is like a little black dot in the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=758.86s)]
*  middle of a greater thing that we would call the self. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=764.6999999999999s)]
*  Like the Jungian self with a capital S. And the self contains the collective unconscious, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=768.3s)]
*  all the aspects of the unconscious, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=774.2199999999999s)]
*  The hero's journey, the archetypes of the unconscious, all of the sort of intuitive [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=777.9399999999999s)]
*  stuff, right? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=782.4599999999999s)]
*  When you, I would imagine, come up with great comedy material or any kind of material, it's [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=783.5s)]
*  coming from that self, coming from that deeper place, right? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=788.9799999999999s)]
*  Even when Jung or Joseph Campbell describe the self, they have a, I have a little diagram [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=793.0600000000001s)]
*  in the War of Art where adjacent to this larger self, they'd have like three arrows and the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=799.3000000000001s)]
*  arrows are coming from what they call the divine ground, which I take to mean whatever [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=804.6600000000001s)]
*  greater force is out there, you know, that will come to you. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=810.5400000000001s)]
*  So this is a long way of saying that the ego, which is, right, your I part, the part that [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=814.9200000000001s)]
*  identifies with this body and with the ego wants to be in control, right? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=822.2s)]
*  The ego is where you drive down to the store, you get whatever it is, right? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=829.6400000000001s)]
*  But when you're trying to tap into that greater intelligence, like if you're writing, if you're [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=834.24s)]
*  trying to come up to, if you're a musician, if you're any kind of creative person, you're [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=839.44s)]
*  trying to surrender to that self, to that greater self. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=843.5400000000001s)]
*  And I feel like the ego hates that. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=847.64s)]
*  The ego knows if you make that shift to identify with that greater self, then the ego is out [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=852.3s)]
*  of business. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=858.76s)]
*  So I think, this is my theory, that the ego produces resistance to try to stop you from [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=859.86s)]
*  connecting and trusting and believing, because it is a leap of faith, right, to get to that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=866.4399999999999s)]
*  other level, wherever it is. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=871.4s)]
*  So the ego says to you, who do you think you are to try to tap into that thing? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=873.36s)]
*  Who do you think you are to come up with this idea? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=877.62s)]
*  It's been done a million times better than you'll ever do it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=880.36s)]
*  You don't have the chops to do this. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=883.24s)]
*  You're going to fall on your ass, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=884.86s)]
*  Or let me distract you. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  Why don't we chase some women? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=889.08s)]
*  Why don't we get drunk? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=890.76s)]
*  Why don't we hang out with our buddies? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=891.76s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=893.04s)]
*  But so I think that what the ego wants is to maintain its control, right? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=894.04s)]
*  And if you make that shift into that greater self, that's when you really are starting [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=898.98s)]
*  to tap into great stuff. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=903.9s)]
*  That's where the great stuff comes from. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=906.02s)]
*  And that puts the ego out of a job. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=908.14s)]
*  At least that, this is my theory, Joe. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=909.94s)]
*  So I think that the ego produces it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=912.7s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting, sort of animals don't experience resistance. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=915.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm sure they don't, right? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=920.02s)]
*  Right, but they also don't really experience creativity. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=921.22s)]
*  True. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=924.26s)]
*  They're in that greater world, I think, naturally. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=925.62s)]
*  You know? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=928.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=929.7s)]
*  They're free. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=930.7s)]
*  They're in that God energy, you know? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=931.7s)]
*  An eagle or somebody that's flying, you know, you watch like the tiniest little wings or [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=933.8199999999999s)]
*  feathers even, you know, control it. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=938.18s)]
*  They're not thinking about anything, right? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=940.12s)]
*  When they're hunting or whatever it is. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=942.4399999999999s)]
*  So anyway, that's my theory on what resistance is. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=944.22s)]
*  Now, Seth Godin, you know, he is. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=948.66s)]
*  He's a believer that it's the- Who is Seth Godin? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=950.9s)]
*  I do not know him. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=953.54s)]
*  Seth Godin is a kind of a marketing guru, one of the earliest guys on the internet, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=954.54s)]
*  from way back when, when it first began. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=962.54s)]
*  And is a great teacher of marketing and stuff like that, and also a wonderful guy in this [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=965.06s)]
*  area, in the sense that he is a highly ethical dude. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=971.6999999999999s)]
*  Like when he talks about businesses, startups, and all the things that he's kind of helping [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=977.26s)]
*  people with, ethics is a huge part of it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=983.46s)]
*  So I really respect the guy. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=986.6600000000001s)]
*  And he's a great deep thinker too. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=988.58s)]
*  Now he thinks it's what he calls the lizard brain, the amygdala, which I'm not even sure [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=990.34s)]
*  what that is. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=995.1s)]
*  I guess it's the reptile brain at the back of your head, that that's what's producing [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=996.1s)]
*  something. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1000.4200000000001s)]
*  It wants producing resistance. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1001.4200000000001s)]
*  But anyway, I respect his thinking on that, but I think it's what I just explained to [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1002.74s)]
*  you. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1008.34s)]
*  What you're saying makes a lot of sense. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1009.5s)]
*  The ego, whatever that thing is, it's so interesting how it's not able to see that it would actually [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1012.8199999999999s)]
*  benefit the ego if you didn't have resistance. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1022.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1027.3799999999999s)]
*  Which is really weird. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1028.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird, isn't it? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1029.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1030.3799999999999s)]
*  Because if the ego was wise and had foresight, it could see the future. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1031.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, if we just give in and relax and relinquish control, then we're going to come up with [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1036.42s)]
*  better stuff and our life's going to be better. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1043.46s)]
*  Be able to buy a nicer house. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1045.66s)]
*  Maybe be able to go on trips. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1048.26s)]
*  Your work will do well. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1050.54s)]
*  Everything will be good. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1052.26s)]
*  It's a deep subject because also if you think about the ego's view of what life is, I'm [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1054.0600000000002s)]
*  going to go into some deep stuff or you don't mind this stuff. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1061.78s)]
*  You don't have to clarify. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1064.8600000000001s)]
*  The ego has a whole view. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1065.98s)]
*  The ego believes that this material world is all there is, right? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1068.8600000000001s)]
*  The ego believes in death. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1075.54s)]
*  The ego believes that when this body dies, we die, right? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1077.58s)]
*  The ego believes that this flesh can be hurt, can be maimed, can be broken, etc., etc. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1081.02s)]
*  The ego naturally lives in fear. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1088.8600000000001s)]
*  I think that the predominant emotion of the ego, if we're living in the ego, which is [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1091.98s)]
*  99% of people do, our predominant emotion is fear, right? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1097.58s)]
*  Even though we might not know it, fear of death, which is kind of why people want to [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1103.38s)]
*  achieve, I think, right? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1108.5s)]
*  Let me make a name for myself, blah, blah, blah, why people want to have children. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1110.74s)]
*  Children will live on. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1114.6200000000001s)]
*  Why they have insurance, why they try to succeed and have a big house and this and that and [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1115.94s)]
*  the other thing, right? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1120.74s)]
*  It's all sort of coming out of a mindset of fear, whereas this giant self, in my opinion, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1121.98s)]
*  the bigger self that is connected to the thing, its predominant emotion is love, if you ask me. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1129.78s)]
*  Now the ego, another thing the ego believes is that I am separate from you, right? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1136.06s)]
*  We are all separate individuals, right? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1143.26s)]
*  I could hurt you and it won't hurt me. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1145.42s)]
*  That's what the ego thinks, right? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1148.14s)]
*  That's why so much of the evil that happens in the world comes out of that, right? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1149.86s)]
*  We can torture these sons of bitches and it won't happen to us, right? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1153.3799999999999s)]
*  Nothing bad will happen to us. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1156.58s)]
*  But the self believes exactly the opposite. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1158.34s)]
*  Once you get into that deep level, right, that we are not separate from one another, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1161.3s)]
*  that you and I are bound together in some kind of way along with all of humanity and [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1166.26s)]
*  all of the animal life and all of the planet, all of the oceans and all of that. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1170.6599999999999s)]
*  And so the predominant emotion in that self is the emotion of love. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1175.18s)]
*  So the ego, this is my belief anyway, the ego being centered in fear is going to try [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1180.1000000000001s)]
*  to hang on to what it's got, right? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1186.18s)]
*  If the ego thinks that it's living our life, it's calling the shots, it's going to hang [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1188.74s)]
*  on to that out of fear. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1193.46s)]
*  And that's why I think it's so strong, resistance is so strong. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1196.8200000000002s)]
*  The closer you get to moving into that self, into that greater space, like if you're sitting [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1202.66s)]
*  down and trying to write a novel and you get into a kind of a flow of it, that's what the [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1208.52s)]
*  ego is really afraid of because it's such a kind of empowering and intoxicating experience. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1213.8600000000001s)]
*  The ego says to itself, shit, if this guy stays over here very long, he's never going [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1220.14s)]
*  to go back to where I call the shots. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1224.22s)]
*  I think that's why it makes itself, it puts such an intense shot at you to stop you from [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1229.02s)]
*  getting there. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1235.3400000000001s)]
*  So this greater self, what do you think that is? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1236.38s)]
*  If the greater self is all about love and the greater self is what recognizes the connection [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1244.38s)]
*  between all of us, what is the greater self? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1249.3s)]
*  Okay, it's a great question. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1251.8600000000001s)]
*  I know that you're a guy that's into psychedelics to a certain extent, right? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1252.94s)]
*  I mean, when you, now my only experience with psychedelics is back in the 60s, you know? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1256.26s)]
*  So I haven't done any of the stuff that people are doing now. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1261.66s)]
*  Want some? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1263.86s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1264.86s)]
*  I'm too old for that. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1265.86s)]
*  You're not too old. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1267.34s)]
*  But one of the things that you know- [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1268.78s)]
*  Yeah, resistance, that's resistance to psychedelics. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1271.06s)]
*  Maybe so. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1273.04s)]
*  But one of the things that you know from LSD or from Mescaline or anything like that, right, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1274.1s)]
*  is you suddenly see a whole other world that was not there before, right? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1279.22s)]
*  Even though you're looking at that wall, all of a sudden that wall becomes so beautiful, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1284.54s)]
*  right, that you can't even say anything except wow, right? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1289.34s)]
*  So that I believe, I was thinking in those moments, this must be the way Jesus sees the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1294.82s)]
*  world or the Dalai Lama sees the world or God sees the world. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1302.86s)]
*  And when I come back to my regular self and I see this kind of normal shrunk down world, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1307.5s)]
*  that's not the real world, right? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1314.34s)]
*  There's another world that's greater. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1316.06s)]
*  And so that's sort of my feeling about it, Joe, that when the self, when you enter that, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1317.3799999999999s)]
*  there is a greater world. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1322.8999999999999s)]
*  We're living in that greater world right now. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1324.1s)]
*  We just can't see it, you know? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1326.74s)]
*  We just see what's in front of us. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1329.4199999999998s)]
*  And I think another aspect of it to me, you would know a lot more about this than I do [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1331.28s)]
*  being more in the present of this, is that if you're living in that kind of psychedelic [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1336.6999999999998s)]
*  world, you really can't drive a car, you really can't operate heavy equipment, you really [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1342.06s)]
*  can't handle the stuff you have to handle, you can't do your taxes, right? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1345.94s)]
*  So in order to kind of live, you do have to sort of shrink that world down, right, to [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1350.86s)]
*  push all the beauty aside and all the amazing shit aside. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1358.58s)]
*  But that doesn't stop the fact that that stuff is there, right? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1362.54s)]
*  I always wonder, what was it like before we were born? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1365.86s)]
*  And what's it going to be like after we die? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1370.3s)]
*  Are we going to live in that world? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1372.9799999999998s)]
*  Are we going to enter that world again? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1374.4199999999998s)]
*  And what is that? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1376.74s)]
*  What will that be like? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1378.8999999999999s)]
*  Do you think that this narrowed down world that you're talking about when you when the [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1380.4599999999998s)]
*  psychedelics wear off, do you think that's an artifact of the cold, hard reality of being [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1386.1399999999999s)]
*  an animal living amongst predators and other other violent human beings on earth where [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1393.1s)]
*  in order to survive, in order to raise your children and protect your village and provide [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1400.5s)]
*  food to each other, you kind of have to have this very simplistic, just as you said, narrowed [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1407.66s)]
*  down. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1417.7s)]
*  You can't just wax euphorically about the concept of the universe and life and love. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1419.38s)]
*  I do believe that, yes. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1427.7s)]
*  And I think that's why, again, like what I was saying about the ego being dominated [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1430.3s)]
*  by the emotion of fear, right? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1435.1000000000001s)]
*  And also our parents, right, and our society, our school, everything for our own good as [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1437.18s)]
*  we're kids growing up tells us all that, right? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1443.54s)]
*  It kind of indoctrinates us into that world for our own good, right? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1446.86s)]
*  It wants to protect us, you know? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1450.6999999999998s)]
*  On your way walking to school, nobody's going to beat you up, blah, blah, blah. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1452.54s)]
*  So yeah, I do think that's the case. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1456.8999999999999s)]
*  It's kind of a strange world, isn't it, that God created for us? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1458.8s)]
*  I mean, on the one hand, there's this beautiful other dimensional reality out there, but then [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1461.9399999999998s)]
*  there's this hardcore world of predators, you know, in order to, you know, like what [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1467.4599999999998s)]
*  did you just have on Instagram today? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1472.42s)]
*  An alligator taking off the leg off a deer? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1474.38s)]
*  I mean, that's that, you don't even know if what was there, but it's there. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1477.78s)]
*  We just saw it a few minutes ago. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1482.42s)]
*  But I had it on Instagram. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1484.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1485.66s)]
*  Oh, Diana had it. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1486.66s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1487.66s)]
*  Yeah, there was a crocodile that took a pig and snapped it in half. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1488.66s)]
*  Oh, is that what it was? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1493.78s)]
*  Like that. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1494.98s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't see it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1495.98s)]
*  Terrifying video. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1496.98s)]
*  But yeah, that's the world, right? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1497.98s)]
*  The guy gave us. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1499.74s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1500.74s)]
*  Predators and prey. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1502.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1503.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1504.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1505.06s)]
*  So here you are, Joe. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1506.06s)]
*  I mean, you're a fighter, right? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1507.06s)]
*  You're a UFC MMA that's that in that world of predator versus prey. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1509.42s)]
*  But you're also a comic and you're also a podcaster where you're reaching out into this [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1514.5s)]
*  other world, you know, the greater world of who knows what it is. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1518.38s)]
*  Yeah, you're trying. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1523.5s)]
*  You know, it's one of the things I admire about you about what you do on the show, that [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1525.6200000000001s)]
*  you really go into every direction possible and you're talking to every kind of people, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1529.02s)]
*  every kind of person that's got any kind of a theory about anything, which I think is [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1532.66s)]
*  great because we all need everything that we can possibly bring in here. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1535.9s)]
*  Well, I think I certainly do. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1539.3s)]
*  I certainly need as many different points of reference and different perspectives as [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1540.7s)]
*  possible. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1545.62s)]
*  But I'm just very lucky that I'm genuinely curious and then I have a platform to bring [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1546.98s)]
*  in people like yourself or other people and to have conversations with them. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1553.1s)]
*  And it's been very enlightening for me to encounter all these different perspectives [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1557.5s)]
*  and to interact with all these different people that think about the world in a different [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1563.7s)]
*  way. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1566.74s)]
*  And it makes me reconsider my own ideas or reformulate or, you know, just sort of reevaluate. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1567.74s)]
*  And I think people can be very rigid in how they view the world and very rigid in how [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1576.5s)]
*  they, you know, the rules that they set for themselves and for other people. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1583.18s)]
*  And because it allows you to, when you have less options, you have less things to think [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1587.5s)]
*  about and sometimes you can be more successful that way. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1592.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of people that do things very rigidly and they have found great [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1595.3s)]
*  financial and, you know, physical success doing it that way. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1599.5s)]
*  I mean, think about various religions that have such, you know, you can only eat this. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1605.3s)]
*  You must wear that. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1611.14s)]
*  And on Wednesday you do this and it really helps you because you don't have to make any [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1612.74s)]
*  decisions. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1616.9s)]
*  I'm sure it's a happier life in a way. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1617.9s)]
*  But what is it, you know? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1621.22s)]
*  Yeah, there's something to it. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1623.5s)]
*  You know, me and my friends, Tom and Ari and Bert, we do this thing every year called Sober [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1624.78s)]
*  October. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1632.22s)]
*  And generally we come up with, when we do Sober October, we come up with some sort of [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1633.6200000000001s)]
*  a challenge. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1637.74s)]
*  And one year was we had to do 15 yoga sessions in the 31 days of October and, you know, 90 [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1639.1s)]
*  minute yoga sessions. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1646.3799999999999s)]
*  And then the other, the next time we had to do a fitness contest where we counted up the [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1647.3799999999999s)]
*  amount of energy. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1652.78s)]
*  Each one of us, we were using an app and we were trying to compete and the winner, you [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1653.82s)]
*  know, you know, whatever. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1657.62s)]
*  So we did that. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1659.4599999999998s)]
*  And then other years we've done different things. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1661.06s)]
*  And then this year we decided what we're going to do is we're going to work out seven days [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1663.6799999999998s)]
*  a week. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1668.26s)]
*  Every day you have to burn 500 calories. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1669.26s)]
*  So we've kind of decided that a competition is too fucked up because I'm kind of crazy [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1671.8200000000002s)]
*  and I get over competitive. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1675.52s)]
*  It's not fun. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1677.46s)]
*  Not fun for my family, not fun for me because I go crazy. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1678.98s)]
*  So it's way better to not be competitive and just we all are held accountable to this one [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1682.14s)]
*  thing. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1688.66s)]
*  So this one thing was you had to do 100 pushups every day and you had to burn 500 calories [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1689.66s)]
*  in a workout. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1694.18s)]
*  And so everyone did it. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1695.26s)]
*  We sent each other screenshots of our apps and we all talked about it. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1696.26s)]
*  And one of the things we all came out of at the end of it was like knowing that you had [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1700.1000000000001s)]
*  to do this thing was so different than just going, oh, I probably should work out today. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1704.8600000000001s)]
*  Maybe I won't. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1711.8600000000001s)]
*  Maybe I'll fuck off. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1712.94s)]
*  Like today, for instance, I was up late last night. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1713.94s)]
*  I got home from the comedy show. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1717.6200000000001s)]
*  I did a little mushrooms. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1719.98s)]
*  And then I did a little writing and I didn't go to bed until like 2, 33 o'clock. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1722.34s)]
*  And so I woke up at 10. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1729.16s)]
*  I was like, God, I should work out, but I don't fucking feel like working out. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1730.16s)]
*  I go, let me just get in the sauna and do the cold plunge, which is my minimum amount [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1733.84s)]
*  of things that I do every day. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1738.28s)]
*  But then after I did that, I was like, you should have worked out, man. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1739.8799999999999s)]
*  But I didn't. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1743.04s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1744.04s)]
*  So I didn't. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1745.04s)]
*  But if it was the sober October month, I would have had to because I had those nights [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1746.04s)]
*  during sober October where I was up late and I only got like six hours sleep. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1750.88s)]
*  But I still got that work in because I had to do it. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1754.96s)]
*  When you have a thing that you must do every day, that's how you get productive. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1758.4s)]
*  And what we found, all of us found, is there's this alleviation of anxiety that comes from [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  doing these workouts every day. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1769.64s)]
*  That was like, we were all talking. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1771.8200000000002s)]
*  I was like, if this was a pill that I could take, I'd take that pill all day. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1773.4s)]
*  If it had no side effects. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1777.2s)]
*  In fact, this pill makes you healthier. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1779.26s)]
*  But instead of a pill, it's an hour to an hour and a half of arduous physical work, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1781.82s)]
*  like very difficult physical work. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1787.8600000000001s)]
*  You're pouring sweat. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1789.8600000000001s)]
*  And when it's over, you're exhausted, but healthier. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1791.22s)]
*  And then the anxiety level is like nil. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1796.06s)]
*  Like nothing bothers you. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1799.64s)]
*  You feel so good. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1800.7s)]
*  You've taken your tension like your body's a wet rag and just rang out all the tension. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1802.74s)]
*  Just dripped it out. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1809.1s)]
*  And the fact that you have to do it every day, it kind of eliminates this whole resistance [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1810.58s)]
*  thing because you can't entertain it. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1817.1799999999998s)]
*  And because we're all accountable, we're all texting each other, and we're in a group text. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1819.86s)]
*  It was great. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1826.06s)]
*  It's great. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1827.06s)]
*  So why not do it 12 months of the year? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1828.06s)]
*  I don't know if it's sustainable, but what I am doing is five days a week. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1831.1799999999998s)]
*  So five days a week I do it now. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1834.4599999999998s)]
*  So instead of seven days a week, I do it five days a week. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1836.48s)]
*  Which is because I travel, do stuff. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1839.76s)]
*  It's more sustainable, but it seems very effective. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1842.48s)]
*  So today I bitched out. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1845.44s)]
*  So now I know that I only have six more days. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1847.9s)]
*  Well, I worked out yesterday, but there's only a certain amount of days in a week. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1850.92s)]
*  So now I've got three more days that I must get in. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1856.3200000000002s)]
*  No ifs, ands, or buts. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1859.5800000000002s)]
*  Those have to be done because I did Monday and Tuesday and then I fucked off today. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1861.42s)]
*  So I've got other days, but it's not the same. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1866.08s)]
*  If you're doing it every day, like if it's a religion, which is why I understand why [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1871.32s)]
*  people would get up in the morning and you have to pray. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1875.72s)]
*  Get up in the morning, face the east, get on your hands and knees and bow. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1878.9199999999998s)]
*  There's something to that that hijacks all of that resistance shit. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1883.84s)]
*  All of the things that hold you back from finding your greater self. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1890.0s)]
*  All the things that hold you back from accomplishing your true potential in this life. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1895.1599999999999s)]
*  I think what that is to me is an exercise, like a ritualistic exercise in overcoming [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1901.2399999999998s)]
*  resistance and in getting into that greater place. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1908.1999999999998s)]
*  When you say rung out, you're rung out of every ego thought. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1913.0s)]
*  You're rung out of all your negative thoughts. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1917.6s)]
*  You're not being jealous of anybody else. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1920.6999999999998s)]
*  You're not being competitive of anybody else. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1922.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm not a meditator, but I imagine that's what that's all about. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1925.76s)]
*  You get up every morning and you center yourself and you do all that sort of thing and you [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1931.24s)]
*  get to that place. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1935.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm a total believer in what you're talking about, Joe. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1938.14s)]
*  I think that's probably with people who have... [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1941.46s)]
*  Whoever the original writers of various religions, the way they crafted it, I think all of those [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1946.78s)]
*  rules and regulations and not just keeping society order, but keeping you ordered, keeping [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1953.3s)]
*  your mind ordered. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1961.94s)]
*  They knew there was something, there's a disconnect between what you can do and what you're going [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1964.28s)]
*  to do. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1969.98s)]
*  What your potential is and where you're going to actually find yourself fall. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1970.98s)]
*  They know there's a devil out there. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1976.5s)]
*  The devil is, I would call it resistance, but it's those negative thoughts that you [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1977.94s)]
*  can spiral into. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1982.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1983.02s)]
*  It never, nothing good ever came out of that. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1984.02s)]
*  It's always, let's hate the other guy, create the other and hate them or take our own selves [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1986.8600000000001s)]
*  down. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1991.46s)]
*  I fight it myself. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1992.46s)]
*  I'm lying in bed in the morning and those thoughts come to my mind. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1993.46s)]
*  I don't know if you're... [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1997.3s)]
*  Are you familiar with Paramahansa Yogananda's stuff at all from Self-Realization Fellowship? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=1998.3s)]
*  He's one of the great gurus. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2004.54s)]
*  He actually died in 1952 or something like that, so he's not a contemporary dude. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2005.66s)]
*  One of the things that he says is, when you wake up in the morning, get out of bed right [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2011.34s)]
*  away. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2016.94s)]
*  Do not lie there thinking any kind of thoughts because those thoughts only are negative and [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2018.14s)]
*  are only taking you bad. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2023.98s)]
*  He says, get up, start your day. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2025.9s)]
*  And I'm definitely a believer in that too. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2028.5s)]
*  Why are they negative when you wake up and you just lay there? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2031.3799999999999s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2033.66s)]
*  I don't know where it is, but somebody asked me, when in your day do you first experience [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2034.66s)]
*  resistance? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2040.86s)]
*  And my answer is the minute I open my eyes. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2042.1s)]
*  It's right there, which is also really interesting. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2045.6999999999998s)]
*  I don't know the answer to this. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2048.74s)]
*  If you think about the sleep state, whatever that is, there's no resistance in that state. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2049.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2056.7s)]
*  Maybe we're in that greater world, that unconscious. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2058.18s)]
*  It's only when we come into consciousness, all of a sudden that resistance thing is there. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2061.7799999999997s)]
*  The devil is there. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2067.1s)]
*  The shitty thoughts are there. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2068.14s)]
*  There's negative thoughts in there, which is why your sober October is really, let's [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2069.2999999999997s)]
*  do something to counteract that shit right away before it grabs us. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2073.7799999999997s)]
*  Or even if it has grabbed us from 6 o'clock till 9 o'clock, now we're going to work out [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2079.7s)]
*  and we're going to do our thing and we're going to overcome it, which you can overcome [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2085.2599999999998s)]
*  it, thank goodness. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2088.98s)]
*  It also has that aspect of religion where you're all in it together. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2091.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2094.98s)]
*  It's ritualistic. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2097.1400000000003s)]
*  You can also do it alone. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2098.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2099.54s)]
*  You definitely could do it alone, but we had real camaraderie in the fact that we were [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2100.54s)]
*  all doing it together. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2105.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like the military in a way, right? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2106.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2109.6200000000003s)]
*  We were accountable to each other too, so we knew that we were accountable to each other. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2110.6200000000003s)]
*  Wouldn't you think that just for the sake of survival, from an evolutionary perspective, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2116.54s)]
*  when you wake up in the morning, that would be the last thing you'd want to do is lay [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2125.02s)]
*  there, just stay put. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2129.7s)]
*  You think that evolution would favor thoughts that immediately launch you into action. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2133.3s)]
*  Yeah, you would think so, that you would be wary and ready to get. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2138.54s)]
*  On the other hand, if you're in the cave and you're under a nice bearskin thing and your [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2142.3s)]

*  I get that you wouldn't want to, but I would think that fortune favors the brave or fortune [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2153.38s)]
*  favors the one who's most active. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2160.38s)]
*  I would imagine in the tribal world, they had somebody standing watch 24 hours a day. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2162.78s)]
*  Even if you or I might be asleep, there would be some young kid that was at the mouth of [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2169.7400000000002s)]

*  Yeah, before they figured it out doors, they probably had to do that. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2175.98s)]
*  It still seems like it doesn't ... Maybe it's just the puzzle that you have to solve in [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2180.3s)]
*  order to tap into the full potential of the mind, because the mind has so many different [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2189.02s)]
*  functions and there's so many different things that it's doing. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2194.0600000000004s)]
*  Then, we're also living in this world that's entirely unnatural. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2196.78s)]
*  It's entirely of our creation, the world of society and civilization and cities and cars [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2201.5800000000004s)]
*  and buses. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2208.1400000000003s)]
*  We're not living in a world that we're engineered for. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2209.86s)]
*  We're engineered for the world of the wild. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2213.06s)]
*  For us to exist in this other world, there's this battle between these deep-seated human [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2217.1800000000003s)]
*  instincts that are designed to help us survive versus what we know we can do creatively as [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2229.3s)]
*  a modern human, in terms of accomplishing great works of literature and creating comedy [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2239.74s)]
*  and creating music and all the different things that humans can do in this modern era, especially [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2246.06s)]
*  when you record things, when you write things down and then you could spread it to millions [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2252.1s)]
*  of people like your books. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2256.7999999999997s)]
*  It's really an extraordinary ability that didn't exist until fairly recently in human [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2258.62s)]
*  history. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2265.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2266.4199999999996s)]
*  We're not really designed for these thoughts and feelings. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2267.4199999999996s)]
*  It's like where you have two separate selves. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2269.34s)]
*  We have the animal self that's the evolutionary self. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2271.1800000000003s)]

*  Let me ask you something, Joe. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2279.1400000000003s)]
*  Where do you see yourself in five years or 10 years? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2282.1000000000004s)]

*  It's clear to me that you are exploring something and you're trying to project your mind into [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2288.82s)]
*  another greater realm. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2297.9s)]

*  You don't? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2315.3s)]
*  No, I just do things that I like to do. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2316.3s)]

*  No legitimately, I don't have goals like that. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2320.98s)]

*  I do the same with being a husband. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2349.8199999999997s)]
*  I do the same being a friend. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2351.58s)]
*  I do the same with being an employer. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2353.7s)]
*  I think you may be overly modest here now [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2356.8599999999997s)]
*  because I know that you're just from the people [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2359.14s)]

*  to all kinds of different points of view, right? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2366.1s)]

*  Yes, but I'm genuinely not trying. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2390.18s)]

*  My goal is to just get better at all the things I'm doing [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2396.38s)]
*  and to understand life, which is probably impossible, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2399.06s)]
*  but I'm trying to understand it better than I do. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2403.74s)]
*  And I definitely understand it better now [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2406.38s)]
*  than I did five years ago, 10 years ago, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2408.7s)]
*  15 years ago, 20 years ago. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2411.38s)]

*  And I think as long as you don't define yourself, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2415.82s)]
*  like some people say, well, I'm 46 years old. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2421.78s)]
*  This is about as smart as I'm ever gonna get. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2425.34s)]
*  This is about as, this is me. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2427.26s)]
*  If I'm still smoking cigarettes and drinking every night, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2429.02s)]

*  I don't buy into that. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2433.78s)]

*  You get better at being a person. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2441.9s)]
*  I think there's an art to being a person. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2443.42s)]
*  And I think that the more things you encounter, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2445.7799999999997s)]
*  the more disciplines you take on, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2449.06s)]

*  that you're obsessed with, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2457.7s)]
*  that you find creatively satisfying, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2458.9s)]
*  the more you do that, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2461.7s)]

*  That's what I think. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2464.86s)]
*  So I feel like if I had this goal, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2466.02s)]
*  if I had a goal ever, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2470.86s)]
*  it was the beginning of my comedy career [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2472.5s)]
*  was like I want to be a professional. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2474.98s)]
*  I wanna be able to make a living telling jokes. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2477.34s)]
*  Because me and my friend, Greg Fitzsimmons, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2480.2200000000003s)]
*  we started out at the same time, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2482.58s)]
*  like a week apart from each other in Boston. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2484.46s)]
*  And we would sit around and we'd talk, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2487.6600000000003s)]
*  man, imagine if you could just pay your bills [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2489.7000000000003s)]
*  doing standup. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2491.7000000000003s)]
*  Because he was working in catering [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2492.82s)]
*  and I was driving the limos. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2494.78s)]
*  And we would get together after shows [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2496.34s)]
*  and just hang out, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2498.3s)]
*  maybe have some dinner or something. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2499.7599999999998s)]
*  And we'd be just like, someday, man, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2501.2s)]
*  imagine that? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2503.2s)]
*  Just being nothing but a comedian. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2504.48s)]
*  That's how you make your living. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2507.12s)]

*  So that was the only goal we ever had. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2509.92s)]
*  And then once that, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2513.4s)]
*  the idea of a career seems so preposterous. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2515.0s)]
*  What career? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2518.08s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2519.7999999999997s)]
*  But then once we started making a living [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2522.7599999999998s)]
*  and then we started doing better [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2526.7999999999997s)]
*  and then things started happening. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2529.96s)]
*  And Greg went on to win Emmys for writing. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2530.8s)]
*  And he's got comedy specials. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2533.96s)]
*  He tours all over the world. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2537.36s)]
*  It did eventually become a thing [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2538.8s)]
*  where you are a professional [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2541.56s)]
*  and then you have these sort of goals [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2543.36s)]
*  inside that profession. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2545.56s)]
*  I'd like to do a new comedy special [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2547.64s)]
*  within the next 12 months. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2550.08s)]
*  I think my material's ready. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2551.4s)]
*  So we talk like that. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2553.04s)]
*  But I don't ever say in 10 years [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2554.04s)]
*  I wanna be this and that. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2557.36s)]
*  15 years I want this. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2559.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't think like that. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2560.84s)]
*  I just keep going. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2562.04s)]
*  I keep on trucking. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2562.96s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2564.4s)]
*  I'll tell you what I feel about that. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2566.44s)]
*  How I feel myself. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2568.4s)]
*  I go from project to project. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2573.8s)]
*  At least from the time that I finally actually [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2576.12s)]
*  was able to make money as a writer and be a writer. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2578.28s)]
*  I go from one to another [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2581.0s)]
*  and each one is like an actor that's cast [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2582.56s)]
*  in a movie or something like that [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2585.7200000000003s)]
*  where you're in that world completely, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2587.36s)]
*  in that lane completely while you're doing it. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2589.6800000000003s)]
*  And I never know what the next one is gonna be. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2591.8s)]
*  But that's sort of, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2595.28s)]
*  I'm a believer in a higher dimension of reality. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2597.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm a believer in the muse [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2601.0800000000004s)]
*  as we were talking about earlier. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2602.32s)]
*  And I sort of, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2604.0s)]
*  so I don't have a goal in the future either. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2605.44s)]
*  I don't say to myself five years from now [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2607.44s)]
*  I wanna be this, 10 years I wanna be that. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2609.6800000000003s)]
*  Cause you never know what trolley is coming down the track. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2611.7200000000003s)]
*  What the next kind of assignment for me [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2616.12s)]
*  from the muse is gonna be. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2619.64s)]
*  What's the next book that gonna be? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2621.2s)]
*  All I know is I'm on the lookout for it. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2623.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm waiting for the cosmic radio station [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2625.6s)]
*  to send me a message and then I'll do that. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2629.7599999999998s)]
*  So if at any point in my writing career, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2632.72s)]
*  if you had asked me what I would be doing [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2637.2s)]
*  five years in the future, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2639.3199999999997s)]
*  I would have been completely wrong [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2641.04s)]
*  if I had ever projected, completely wrong. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2642.68s)]
*  So I never know what's coming up ahead. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2645.2799999999997s)]
*  But I do know just like you [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2650.3999999999996s)]
*  that you can't stand Pat at any point. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2652.72s)]
*  Then you start getting old [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2657.0s)]
*  and then you start going down the grease thing. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2658.9199999999996s)]
*  But I think as long as you're still following that impetus, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2662.52s)]
*  that creative impetus, whatever it is, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2668.3999999999996s)]
*  which is scary, right? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2670.8799999999997s)]
*  It's always a risk. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2672.08s)]
*  You never know what's gonna happen. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2672.9199999999996s)]
*  Then you're okay. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2675.3999999999996s)]
*  So that's all I wanna do is be able to keep doing that. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2676.52s)]
*  That's my, if I make any money, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2681.08s)]
*  I say, okay, that's enough so that I can keep doing it. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2684.16s)]
*  And I never would have thought that [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2689.3999999999996s)]
*  when I was 20 years old or 40 years old. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2691.04s)]
*  But that's how I feel now. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2693.52s)]
*  What would you have thought then you think? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2695.0s)]
*  Of course then I was struggling. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2696.4399999999996s)]
*  I was just trying, like you were just trying to stop, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2697.68s)]
*  driving a cab for a living. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2700.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think projects are really important for people [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2703.28s)]
*  because things to concentrate on [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2706.44s)]
*  that's like a solid, tangible thing. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2708.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's like your sober October. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2712.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2714.7200000000003s)]
*  Or a book, right? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2716.0s)]
*  Or a comedy special. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2717.28s)]
*  Or I think if people just have sort of open-ended things [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2719.88s)]
*  and just like, oh, I'm trying to eat healthy. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2726.76s)]
*  I'm trying to lose weight. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2729.6000000000004s)]
*  Like how are you trying to lose weight? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2731.3599999999997s)]
*  Like what are you doing specifically? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2732.52s)]
*  What's the program you're on? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2734.48s)]
*  Show me the program. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2737.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, I try to get to the gym more. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2738.3199999999997s)]
*  I try, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2740.52s)]
*  Every fucking day, show me what you're doing. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2741.8399999999997s)]
*  Let's go, show me what you're doing. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2744.7599999999998s)]
*  Like let's form a real program. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2746.8799999999997s)]
*  And if you do that, then you see the real changes. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2749.2799999999997s)]
*  That's when you see people lose like 100 pounds [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2752.16s)]
*  and start getting really healthy or write a book. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2754.2799999999997s)]
*  Like you finish the book and then you read the book. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2757.2s)]
*  Like, holy shit, this is great. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2759.2799999999997s)]
*  And then you realize they had a goal. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2761.52s)]
*  They got together with that mindset and they went to work. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2762.8s)]
*  And if you just kind of dilly-dally [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2767.84s)]
*  and you don't have a very specific goal and directions, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2769.8s)]
*  very hard to make real headway. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2773.4s)]
*  It's very hard to really accomplish a thing. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2776.08s)]
*  The other thing to me, and I'm just speaking for myself, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2779.04s)]
*  is it's not enough to have just a generic goal. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2782.28s)]
*  A goal that anybody else could do. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2786.7200000000003s)]
*  Like I'm gonna lose X number of pounds [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2788.48s)]
*  or I'm gonna do that. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2790.32s)]
*  I think it needs to be something creative [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2791.7200000000003s)]
*  that's coming from with you that only you could do. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2793.88s)]
*  Even if it's a business, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2797.0800000000004s)]
*  if you're gonna design motorcycles, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2799.8s)]
*  you're gonna build a motorcycle, whatever it is. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2801.8s)]
*  Because then, when you have a project like that, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2804.48s)]
*  like a book, you start, you're gonna write a book. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2808.44s)]
*  That book has a life of its own. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2811.6800000000003s)]
*  Or you make a movie or you start a business [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2813.6400000000003s)]
*  or whatever it is. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2815.48s)]
*  That thing has a life of its own. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2816.6400000000003s)]
*  Particularly if it's coming out of your heart [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2818.7999999999997s)]
*  and your inner self. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2821.56s)]
*  Like for me or for anybody that writes a book, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2823.04s)]
*  nobody else could write that book, whatever it is. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2826.3599999999997s)]
*  You're in your own lane, tapped into something [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2829.3999999999996s)]
*  that's coming from you, from your deepest self. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2832.7599999999998s)]
*  And as the weeks and months go by, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2835.9199999999996s)]
*  shit comes into you from all kinds of places [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2838.8399999999997s)]
*  that you never knew you had in you. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2841.72s)]
*  And that's an amazing experience. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2844.6s)]
*  And by the end of that book, you look at it, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2847.24s)]
*  you go, I wrote that. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2849.0s)]
*  Or you even say to yourself, that's not me. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2852.04s)]
*  Where did that come from? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2856.0s)]
*  But it is you, because you did it. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2857.24s)]
*  Or if you start a business and suddenly it becomes [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2859.3999999999996s)]
*  whatever it becomes. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2862.72s)]
*  I think it's more important than just something generic. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2864.4799999999996s)]
*  Like lose weight or something like that or run a marathon. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2868.52s)]
*  Not that there's anything wrong with that. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2872.56s)]
*  But if you can pull something out of your own heart, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2874.2799999999997s)]
*  that really lives within you, that's tremendous. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2877.96s)]
*  So the other thing I'll say is, at least in my experience, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2881.6s)]
*  when a book comes along and I sort of get the orders [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2887.04s)]
*  from the goddess, it's always a surprise to me, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2889.24s)]
*  the subject matter of the book. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2893.52s)]
*  Like my first book was about golf, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2895.52s)]
*  the legend of Bagger fans. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2898.4s)]
*  Then what came after that was Gates of Fire, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2899.88s)]
*  a book about the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2902.12s)]
*  I would have never have thought of either of those books [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2905.6s)]
*  coming out of me. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2908.92s)]
*  Those subjects were, it wasn't like I dreamt of that [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2910.52s)]
*  my whole life. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2913.2s)]
*  So I say to myself when that happens, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2914.4s)]
*  where's this coming from? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2918.0s)]
*  What is this all about? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2920.04s)]
*  Why did that come out of me, followed by that? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2921.7999999999997s)]
*  Followed by that. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2925.7599999999998s)]
*  And I still don't know what it means, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2927.24s)]
*  but it's fascinating. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2929.32s)]
*  You look back at a thing like Bruce Springsteen's albums, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2932.0s)]
*  if you could write them all down on a page, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2936.64s)]
*  you go, why did that come after Tom, Joe, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2939.2s)]
*  and the river, the darkness at the edge of town, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2942.4s)]
*  and how did they, it's a mystery to me, I don't know. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2945.48s)]
*  But projects are great things. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2951.2s)]
*  Because they really show you who you are. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2956.92s)]
*  Yeah, and they give you something to concentrate [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2959.48s)]
*  your creative energy on. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2963.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2965.2000000000003s)]
*  They do something. They ground you completely. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2966.04s)]
*  And even just physical fitness projects, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2969.16s)]
*  you wouldn't think that that'd be a creative endeavor, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2971.48s)]
*  but there's something about forcing yourself [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2973.84s)]
*  to acknowledge that your life, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2980.2400000000002s)]
*  that there's a thing in your life that you have to address, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2983.12s)]
*  that it sort of frees up the mind [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2986.2000000000003s)]
*  in some sort of a strange way. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2988.6s)]
*  And the concept of the muse, I think, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2990.92s)]
*  also frees up the mind in a strange way. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2993.88s)]
*  And I love the way you think about it. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2996.16s)]
*  Because you, and I don't want to disrespect it [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=2998.12s)]
*  by saying you treat it like it's a god, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3000.7999999999997s)]
*  because you do think it's a god. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3003.52s)]
*  You think it's like a goddess. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3004.68s)]
*  Like I'm not- I do. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3006.2799999999997s)]
*  Right, so I'm not saying you're silly. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3007.7599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3009.08s)]
*  But it seems like I'm saying you're silly. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3009.92s)]
*  Like of course it's not. No, I don't feel that at all. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3010.7599999999998s)]
*  But it does to a rational person, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3012.36s)]
*  or especially to someone who's an atheist, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3016.12s)]
*  or who doesn't believe in spirits. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3019.16s)]
*  They would say, well, why do you think about it that way? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3023.4s)]
*  Just take accountability, just show up and go to work. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3024.92s)]
*  But there is a real benefit in thinking of it as a muse. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3027.64s)]
*  Whether or not it's real or not, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3033.68s)]
*  if you think about it like it's a muse, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3035.6s)]
*  if you show up at the same time every day [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3037.7999999999997s)]
*  and put in the work, it will reward you as if it's a god. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3040.68s)]
*  It will. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3044.52s)]
*  It really will. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3045.36s)]
*  It will. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3046.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you know who Dr. Joe Dispenza is? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3047.04s)]
*  Ever heard of that guy? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3049.52s)]
*  Ring the bell. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3050.36s)]
*  Now he talks about this in a whole other vocabulary. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3051.2000000000003s)]
*  He talks about the quantum world, whatever that is, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3055.88s)]
*  which is what I would call the muse. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3059.84s)]
*  It's that greater self, right? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3061.84s)]
*  So he looks at it from a whole other perspective. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3064.2400000000002s)]
*  He would say, he wants to get out of the ego, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3066.4s)]
*  leave that behind, and it's psychedelic in a way too. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3069.2000000000003s)]
*  He talks about getting into that world [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3073.44s)]
*  where you are no one and no place and no thing, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3075.12s)]
*  and the senses are gone, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3079.2799999999997s)]
*  and all that's left is vibration and awareness. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3081.8799999999997s)]
*  So that's his way of talking about that. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3085.68s)]
*  For me, I'm sort of anthropomorphic. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3088.2799999999997s)]
*  I like to imagine something with a human face, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3091.0s)]
*  a goddess with that little Greek hairstyle. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3095.08s)]
*  That's what you think of? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3097.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3098.24s)]
*  So I mean, but as long as you have a thing [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3100.12s)]
*  that you're concentrating on, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3103.7599999999998s)]
*  that you sort of give up your control of the moment to, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3104.84s)]
*  and that you respect enough that you're gonna show up [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3109.6s)]
*  every day and put in the work and address this thing. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3112.64s)]
*  Like you actually have like a prayer to the goddess. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3116.48s)]
*  I do, yeah. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3118.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, what is the prayer? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3119.6s)]
*  Can you tell us what it is? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3120.44s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3121.2799999999997s)]
*  It's actually a mentor of mine, a guy named Paul Rink, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3122.7599999999998s)]
*  gave me this, printed this out, typed this out. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3127.64s)]
*  It's the prayer from Homer's Odyssey, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3130.12s)]
*  the opening invocation of the muse. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3134.12s)]
*  As Homer himself was sitting, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3136.7599999999998s)]
*  if you look at the first 12 lines of the Odyssey, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3138.56s)]
*  that's his kind of prayer to the muse. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3142.2799999999997s)]
*  And do you want me to say it out loud? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3144.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3148.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay, and I say this every morning out loud. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3149.12s)]
*  Paul taught me this. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3153.08s)]
*  It goes like this. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3153.92s)]
*  Oh divine poesy, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3155.04s)]
*  goddess daughter of Zeus, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3158.0s)]
*  sustain for me this song, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3160.66s)]
*  I'm getting goosebumps as I'm saying this, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3162.7599999999998s)]
*  of the various minded man, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3165.12s)]
*  who after he had plundered the innermost citadel [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3167.48s)]
*  of hallowed Troy, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3170.36s)]
*  ah, was made to stray grievously about the coasts of men, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3171.92s)]
*  the sport of their customs, good and bad, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3176.84s)]
*  while his heart through all the seafaring, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3179.96s)]
*  ached with an agony to redeem himself [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3182.7599999999998s)]
*  and bring his company safe home. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3184.8399999999997s)]
*  And it kind of continues through that, you know, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3186.6s)]
*  for his fellows he strove in vain, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3191.68s)]
*  I'll just skip to the end, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3194.16s)]
*  make this tale live for us [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3195.3199999999997s)]
*  in all its many bearings, oh muse. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3197.14s)]
*  So, and what's interesting about that, Joe, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3199.72s)]
*  there's a lot of things interesting about that. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3202.64s)]
*  But that sort of paradigm of a story of Odysseus, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3204.74s)]
*  the various minded man, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3208.9599999999996s)]
*  if you look at almost any novel, any movie, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3210.72s)]
*  any legend, anyone, that fits, you know? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3214.0s)]
*  And I've found that any novel that I've been working on, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3218.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know how many I've done, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3221.9199999999996s)]
*  10 or 11 or something like that, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3222.8399999999997s)]
*  I say that prayer, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3224.04s)]
*  and I'm amazed that the story I'm working on fits exactly. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3225.3199999999997s)]
*  There's always somebody that's kind of been cast out [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3229.7999999999997s)]
*  into exile and is lost and is trying to get home, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3233.14s)]
*  whatever home means, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3237.06s)]
*  and is struggling, struggling, struggling. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3238.68s)]
*  And so Homer, I'm sure he did believe in the muse, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3241.68s)]
*  I mean, that was whatever it was, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3245.3999999999996s)]
*  3,200 years ago, something like that. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3248.18s)]
*  Those gods and goddesses were real. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3250.56s)]
*  You know, for whatever this is worth, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3253.2s)]
*  the Spartans, the ancient Spartans, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3255.72s)]
*  we know they were as hardcore as they could possibly be. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3257.68s)]
*  When their army would march out on a campaign [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3261.44s)]
*  and they got to the frontier of Lechettomon, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3264.6s)]
*  in the name of their region of Greece, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3267.92s)]
*  they would take the omens. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3270.8s)]
*  And if the omens were unfavorable, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3273.0s)]
*  the whole army would turn around and go home. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3274.88s)]
*  So they took it pretty seriously. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3278.2000000000003s)]
*  And you know, I do too. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3282.2400000000002s)]
*  That seems a little ridiculous. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3285.04s)]
*  That's superstitious. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3287.32s)]
*  I mean, it's like, but that's the dance. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3288.92s)]
*  It's like, how much control are you gonna give to this idea? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3290.6800000000003s)]
*  Are you gonna give it when it benefits you, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3295.28s)]
*  or are you gonna give it to the point [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3298.0400000000004s)]
*  where you run the risk of becoming paranoid? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3299.2000000000003s)]
*  True, true. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3303.2000000000003s)]
*  And then you can sabotage. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3304.0400000000004s)]
*  Probably they should have marched out on certain. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3304.88s)]
*  Perhaps. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3306.6400000000003s)]
*  But all I'm saying is they took it really seriously. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3307.48s)]
*  Yeah, well perhaps they were aware of something [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3309.2400000000002s)]
*  that we weren't, like that maybe there is something [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3311.28s)]
*  to these signs, and at the very least, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3315.6800000000003s)]
*  maybe there's something to the signs, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3318.6000000000004s)]
*  whereas if they erode your confidence in the mission, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3320.56s)]
*  and you ignore those signs, then when things go sideways, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3325.24s)]
*  you won't have conviction in your task. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3329.4s)]
*  But if you do have signs that indicate [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3334.08s)]
*  you're on the correct path, that the gods are with you, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3337.72s)]
*  then you will have confidence in your conviction. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3340.96s)]
*  Yeah, but wouldn't it be interesting, Joe, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3343.16s)]
*  if it really was true? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3345.72s)]
*  I mean, if there really were forces that we couldn't see, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3348.16s)]
*  that shamans or people like that can see. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3353.6s)]
*  And I mean, I'm not saying that's true, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3357.72s)]
*  but it would be, who says that this technological, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3360.52s)]
*  scientific way that we have of looking at the world [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3365.68s)]
*  is the right way? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3368.2s)]
*  I mean, over all the course of history, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3369.88s)]
*  the Egyptians, the pyramids, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3371.96s)]
*  we still can't figure out how they did it, right? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3373.48s)]
*  You had the guests on your show that said that, right, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3376.84s)]
*  that civilization, there was a civilization [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3379.76s)]
*  that was destroyed. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3382.28s)]
*  Graham Hancock, yeah. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3383.12s)]
*  What if that was true? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3383.96s)]
*  And those civilizations were tapped into, who knows? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3387.0s)]
*  Well, it seems very likely that it was true. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3390.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen his Netflix series, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3393.08s)]
*  it's out now, it's really amazing. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3394.76s)]
*  I haven't, what's it called? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3396.2400000000002s)]
*  It's called Ancient Apocalypse. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3397.7200000000003s)]
*  Ah, right, right, right. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3399.8s)]
*  And it is all about all of the evidence [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3400.6400000000003s)]
*  that points to a lost civilization [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3403.84s)]
*  that was most likely destroyed [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3407.2400000000002s)]
*  by a thing called the Younger Dryas Impact Theory. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3410.48s)]
*  The Younger Dryas Impact Theory [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3413.6400000000003s)]
*  was somewhere around 12,800 years ago, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3415.1200000000003s)]
*  we encountered comets, and they slammed into Earth [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3418.32s)]
*  and probably wiped out most of civilization [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3422.4s)]
*  and reset human history. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3426.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm open to an idea like that. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3429.28s)]
*  Well, there's real physical evidence [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3431.88s)]
*  and it's an interesting idea. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3434.56s)]
*  And for the longest time, when he wrote the first book, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3436.0s)]
*  which was Fingerprints of the Gods, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3440.2799999999997s)]
*  he was widely criticized for it [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3442.2s)]
*  and dismissed as being a charlatan and a crazy person. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3444.6s)]
*  But now there's a lot of real physical evidence [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3449.24s)]
*  in the form of ancient structures [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3451.64s)]
*  and then also in the form of when the comets made impact, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3453.9199999999996s)]
*  when they do core samples and they look through the Earth [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3459.3599999999997s)]
*  at that same time period, they find high levels of iridium, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3462.28s)]
*  high levels of nanodiamonds that are formed [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3466.52s)]
*  when things impact the Earth with great force. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3470.8s)]
*  So there's a lot of, the iridium thing is like, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3474.48s)]
*  it's very common in space and very rare on Earth [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3477.52s)]
*  and there's a nice layer of it around 12,000 years ago, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3480.0800000000004s)]
*  which is also the end of the Ice Age. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3484.0400000000004s)]
*  And they think that the Ice Age ended [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3486.0400000000004s)]
*  because comets slammed into the ice caps [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3488.0400000000004s)]
*  and melted everything almost instantaneously, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3491.56s)]
*  causing massive floods. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3494.2s)]
*  And those are the floods that were talked about in stories, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3495.68s)]
*  like the Epic of Gilgamesh, Noah's Ark. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3498.7599999999998s)]
*  And I mean, many, many, many ancient cultures [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3501.68s)]
*  have these catastrophe myths. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3504.72s)]
*  And he thinks that that's what those all came from, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3507.72s)]
*  they all come from a very true thing. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3509.92s)]
*  Ah, so we're talking about things that we can't prove, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3512.36s)]
*  like the flying saucer up there, that maybe they are, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3516.84s)]
*  there's something to that. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3521.4s)]
*  Yeah, well Young had theories about [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3522.92s)]
*  like what flying saucers were too, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3524.88s)]
*  that there were manifestations, I think, of the human mind. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3526.84s)]
*  And that might be real too. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3531.4s)]
*  Like whatever, this idea of like a solid world [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3533.84s)]
*  that you can only measure and put on a scale, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3541.36s)]
*  well then why is it that when you do call to the muse [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3544.44s)]
*  and you do put in the work, why are you rewarded? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3548.14s)]
*  Is it simply just a matter of, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3551.7s)]
*  because you disciplined yourself to work? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3556.1s)]
*  Or is there something in giving up control [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3558.9s)]
*  to whatever it is that causes people [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3563.22s)]
*  to have wonderful ideas? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3567.54s)]
*  Like wonderful ideas are like these little gifts. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3569.8199999999997s)]
*  Like whenever I have a new idea for a bit [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3572.98s)]
*  or a new punchline, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3575.2999999999997s)]
*  it's like the universe gave me a gift. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3576.94s)]
*  Yeah, isn't it? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3578.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3579.54s)]
*  Like I have a punchline and I say it [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3580.38s)]
*  and the audience laughs so loud. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3581.9s)]
*  You're like, wow, the universe just gave me a gift. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3583.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3586.14s)]
*  Like what is that? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3586.98s)]
*  Like where's that coming from? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3587.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3589.1s)]
*  I could say, oh, it's just me, just me in my mind, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3589.94s)]
*  but there's a benefit in some strange way to saying, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3594.16s)]
*  no, no, no, no, no, you're just showing up. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3598.42s)]
*  You're showing up and you're getting out of the way. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3603.18s)]
*  You're getting out of the way [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3605.62s)]
*  and then the stuff comes through you [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3606.8199999999997s)]
*  and then you write it all out. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3610.5s)]
*  I mean, we're sort of, again, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3613.2999999999997s)]
*  we're kind of talking about to me the greater self [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3614.2799999999997s)]
*  or the unconscious or that thing. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3616.46s)]
*  I mean, what is it like? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3617.9s)]
*  I know sometimes I, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3619.2999999999997s)]
*  let's say I've been working all day on something [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3622.7799999999997s)]
*  and I go and I take a walk at the end of the day [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3624.7s)]
*  and my mind is emptying and I'm going along [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3626.7799999999997s)]
*  and suddenly it'll come into my mind, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3629.2599999999998s)]
*  there's a typo on page 178 [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3632.22s)]
*  and I'll go, what? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3636.5s)]
*  And of course it's right, right? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3637.34s)]
*  As soon as I go back, I look at it's there. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3638.5s)]
*  So some mind, some level of consciousness is operating, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3640.42s)]
*  so below our level of consciousness. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3647.38s)]
*  So maybe it's just as simple as tapping into that, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3651.34s)]
*  but going back- [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3654.14s)]
*  I think there's more to that though. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3654.98s)]
*  There's back to, I would say, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3656.86s)]
*  going back to what you were just saying [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3659.2599999999998s)]
*  a couple of minutes ago, Joe, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3660.5s)]
*  that there's sort of two halves of it. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3662.2599999999998s)]
*  One half is the sort of the airy-fairy half [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3663.58s)]
*  that talks about something coming from somewhere [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3666.42s)]
*  we don't know, but the other half is a discipline half. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3668.62s)]
*  The other half is, it's the right brain, left brain, right? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3671.74s)]
*  Where we've kind of made that instrument, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3675.14s)]
*  our body, our mind, ready to accept that. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3677.42s)]
*  To tune into the cosmic radio station [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3681.86s)]
*  and whatever's coming in, to remember it, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3684.38s)]
*  to take it seriously, to put it down, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3688.2599999999998s)]
*  and then to work with it. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3691.42s)]
*  So to me, it's like a symphony exists [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3693.38s)]
*  on another dimension of reality, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3699.02s)]
*  but it takes Beethoven here, who knows how to do it, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3701.3s)]
*  knows how to bring it in, knows how to open himself to it, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3707.58s)]
*  but also has the chops, has the musical chops, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3710.5s)]
*  and the intellectual chops to put it together [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3713.7000000000003s)]
*  into a form that you and I can listen to. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3718.6600000000003s)]
*  So to me, it's kind of right brain and it lets two things. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3721.78s)]
*  Well, there's a thought too, right? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3724.82s)]
*  And this thought is, why have people throughout time, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3726.3s)]
*  why have they gravitated towards these ideas of deities? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3730.9s)]
*  Is it just because we don't know? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3736.02s)]
*  We see lightning in the sky and we assume it's gods? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3737.5s)]
*  But there's more to it than that, right? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3740.34s)]
*  There's a moral structure that these things give us. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3742.1800000000003s)]
*  There's a thing that we get out of them [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3745.98s)]
*  that doesn't exist in the animal world, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3749.58s)]
*  the world of that crocodile snapping that pig in half. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3752.94s)]
*  The world doesn't, they don't have any of that. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3756.14s)]
*  They're just kill or be killed. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3759.3s)]
*  It's tooth, fang, and claw the whole way. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3760.58s)]
*  But we elevate, we are somehow or another, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3762.82s)]
*  even though we are nature and we are animals [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3766.38s)]
*  and we are creatures of life and of the universe, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3769.46s)]
*  we somehow or another have a sense that there's more. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3772.74s)]
*  I think it's an emerging sense. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3776.5s)]
*  And I think this emerging sense is evolving, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3778.54s)]
*  just like our ability to see things and hear things [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3781.5s)]
*  and our ability to speak. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3784.62s)]
*  All these things are helping us understand [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3786.1s)]
*  that there's maybe more to life [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3790.02s)]
*  and that we are somehow or another connected. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3792.14s)]
*  And one of the beautiful things about your work [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3795.42s)]
*  that I think you'll probably agree with [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3798.1s)]
*  is that there's a great satisfaction in the fact [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3800.1s)]
*  that your work has helped people. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3803.18s)]
*  Your work has helped me. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3805.14s)]
*  Me reading The War of Art has absolutely motivated me [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3807.2200000000003s)]
*  and helped me and helped me understand things. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3811.7000000000003s)]
*  And because of that, you, by your work and by thinking [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3814.38s)]
*  and by getting out of your own way and summoning the muse, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3818.7400000000002s)]
*  you've created this thing that has then, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3821.02s)]
*  everybody else's experience too. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3823.42s)]
*  And it helps us all rise up. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3825.5800000000004s)]
*  There's something to that. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3828.1800000000003s)]
*  I think there is. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3830.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, not forgetting about myself. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3831.1000000000004s)]
*  I do think that there is some force, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3832.94s)]
*  if you think of all the music that's been written, right? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3837.66s)]
*  Or all the books or all the podcasts [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3840.14s)]
*  or all the information that's been brought out, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3842.22s)]
*  there's gotta be a payoff for that somewhere, right? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3844.8199999999997s)]
*  Because it's all a gift. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3849.58s)]
*  People are all trying to give something to somebody. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3851.54s)]
*  And a lot of that gift is the alleviation of pain, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3854.8999999999996s)]
*  I think, you know? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3857.8999999999996s)]
*  Of broken hearts, of fear, of self-destructive things [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3859.06s)]
*  that you read a book or you listen to a piece of music [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3863.2999999999997s)]
*  and you go, you know, I'm not alone. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3865.46s)]
*  I'm not the only person that's dealing with this shit. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3867.42s)]
*  You know, so and so actually there's meaning to it. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3869.82s)]
*  It isn't just meaningless. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3873.14s)]
*  And I hope you're right that we are evolving [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3875.06s)]
*  the human race. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3877.94s)]
*  The other hand, I would wonder if, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3879.42s)]
*  when we go back to primitive people, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3881.3s)]
*  if they had somehow a deeper understanding [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3883.66s)]
*  or a more direct understanding of God or whatever. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3887.38s)]
*  Who knows what, you know, Jesus in the wilderness [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3891.86s)]
*  or the desert, what, you know? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3895.18s)]
*  There's probably something to this deeper understanding [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3897.8599999999997s)]
*  because they were less burdened down by dogma. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3900.22s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, if you really only had the culture [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3905.1s)]
*  of the people that you were surrounded by, you know, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3910.46s)]
*  that's all you had. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3913.1s)]
*  Maybe you had less things to consider about, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3914.62s)]
*  like I think we're very much burdened by media [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3918.4199999999996s)]
*  and the outside world. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3921.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, think about all the fear-mongering [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3922.8999999999996s)]
*  that goes on in the news because if it bleeds, it leads. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3926.02s)]
*  Whatever scary is the thing that gets the headline. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3928.66s)]
*  So you're constantly taking in all this data [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3932.18s)]
*  that's scaring the shit out of you. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3934.9s)]
*  Like Bill Hicks used to have a great, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3936.18s)]
*  do you know Bill Hicks? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3938.02s)]
*  No, no. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3938.86s)]
*  Great stand-up comedian who died young [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3939.68s)]
*  and was one of the most influential stand-up comedians [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3942.14s)]
*  maybe ever. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3944.46s)]
*  So much so that there was a green room [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3946.06s)]
*  at the punch line in Georgia, in Atlanta. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3948.94s)]
*  And when you'd work there in the green room, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3951.18s)]
*  before you go on stage, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3953.1s)]
*  someone had written on the walls, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3954.1s)]
*  quit trying to be Hicks. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3955.66s)]
*  Because so many comedians were so, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3957.2999999999997s)]
*  they were so blown away by him [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3960.2999999999997s)]
*  that they kind of imitated him. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3962.2999999999997s)]
*  It was really common. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3964.38s)]
*  But he had this bit about CNN [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3965.9s)]
*  that you'd watch CNN and it was war, death, famine, disease. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3969.7799999999997s)]
*  And he'd go outside and birds are chirping. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3973.7799999999997s)]
*  Where is this shit? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3976.2999999999997s)]
*  He's like, Ted Turner's making all this shit up. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3977.62s)]
*  Like in your life, this didn't exist. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3979.74s)]
*  And that you really need to be concerned [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3983.7799999999997s)]
*  with the things you actually encounter. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3988.02s)]
*  But now we're not. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3990.18s)]
*  Now we're encountering these enormous problems [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3991.9399999999996s)]
*  like global war or the temperature, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3994.9399999999996s)]
*  the climate's changing. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=3998.3799999999997s)]
*  And it's human beings and we have to change [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4000.06s)]
*  how we extract energy and information. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4002.5s)]
*  And what are we doing? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4005.3799999999997s)]
*  Like totally. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4007.06s)]
*  And why is there so much crime? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4007.9799999999996s)]
*  And why is there so much poverty? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4009.9799999999996s)]
*  And why is education so fucked? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4011.54s)]
*  And why do these terrible people want to run the planet? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4013.78s)]
*  And why are they extracting money? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4016.34s)]
*  And why are they like, they're almost dead. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4018.34s)]
*  They're 80 years old and they're still concentrated [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4020.42s)]
*  on the same goddamn thing that people were concentrated on [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4022.46s)]
*  when they were cave people, just acquiring resources [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4025.62s)]
*  and dominating the other cultures. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4028.74s)]
*  And like we're overrun by so much extraneous data. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4030.34s)]
*  And I think that if we were not, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4036.22s)]
*  and we were living in these sort of tribal environments, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4039.5s)]
*  I think it's more in a line with a natural way of life. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4045.38s)]
*  And maybe being more in line with a natural way [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4051.06s)]
*  that the human animal evolved to exist in, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4054.66s)]
*  that maybe you have more freedom to think about [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4059.78s)]
*  the very source of life, the very source of these thoughts, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4064.46s)]
*  the source of love, the source of creativity [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4068.14s)]
*  and of progress and what all that means. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4072.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think of sometimes like 10,000 years ago, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4074.94s)]
*  the first yogis in the Indus Valley [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4079.7s)]
*  or wherever the hell they were, right? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4082.7999999999997s)]
*  Where they had infinite time, you would think, right? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4084.66s)]
*  They were okay. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4086.9s)]
*  And they could just work postures and poses [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4088.18s)]
*  and study what happens when this little, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4091.7799999999997s)]
*  when you release this little muscle here. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4095.54s)]
*  And when your spine is aligned in exactly the right way. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4098.34s)]
*  And they had like generation after generation [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4101.179999999999s)]
*  after generation, right? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4103.42s)]
*  Father to son, mother to daughter, whatever. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4104.94s)]
*  What did they get to? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4108.82s)]
*  The energy coming up, the spine, the shock was all, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4111.26s)]
*  where does all that, I have no idea what that is. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4113.94s)]
*  I just have a kind of a layman's knowledge of that. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4115.74s)]
*  But think about hundreds of years of doing that, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4119.34s)]
*  of just focusing inward or the great, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4122.38s)]
*  meditating people that would get, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4125.0599999999995s)]
*  God only knows where they got to. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4126.74s)]
*  No CNN, nothing to distract them. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4131.5s)]
*  And the other thing, the news, CNN and all that sort of stuff [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4137.0599999999995s)]
*  is really the voice of resistance. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4141.9s)]
*  You couldn't define it more than what's coming out. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4144.7s)]
*  It's all fear, fear, fear, fear, fear. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4148.82s)]
*  It's all us versus them. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4152.139999999999s)]
*  You're alone, I'm alone. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4154.62s)]
*  These motherfuckers are trying to take what you've got. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4157.0199999999995s)]
*  That sort of thing. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4159.94s)]
*  And because we're all weak and we give, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4160.78s)]
*  and resistance is like our native tongue. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4165.0199999999995s)]
*  We, and I'm guilty of this shit too. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4168.26s)]
*  It comes in and I'm hooked on it. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4171.26s)]
*  It's washing over me. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4173.94s)]
*  And I always feel dirty when it's done. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4175.22s)]
*  Like I need to take a shower or get something out of that. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4178.54s)]
*  The 24 hour news cycle is another horrible thing. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4184.7s)]
*  It used to be just Walter Cronkite [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4187.9s)]
*  for a half hour in the evening. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4189.5s)]
*  But we were uninformed then. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4191.58s)]
*  That's the argument against that. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4193.82s)]
*  Is that we do live in a complex and ever connected world [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4195.5s)]
*  and you should be informed of all of the things [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4199.14s)]
*  that are dangerous. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4202.42s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4203.74s)]
*  I mean, what are we being informed of? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4204.94s)]
*  It's a very limited stuff. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4207.62s)]
*  It's like, oh, a missile landed in Poland [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4210.54s)]
*  or there was an explosion in Poland yesterday. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4213.94s)]
*  And you could tell, I'm sure in the newsrooms [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4216.3s)]
*  and the executives, oh, they were ecstatic [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4218.5s)]
*  when they heard that, right? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4221.139999999999s)]
*  Oh, this will scare the fuck out of everybody, right? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4222.42s)]
*  It's, you know. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4224.9s)]
*  Do you think they think like that? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4225.74s)]
*  Absolutely, because like you say, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4227.259999999999s)]
*  if it bleeds, it leads, right? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4228.54s)]
*  But do you think they think like that [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4230.139999999999s)]
*  or do they think it's imperative [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4231.58s)]
*  that we get this information out? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4233.259999999999s)]
*  Because this is- [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4234.74s)]
*  They may have brainwashed themselves to believe that, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4235.58s)]
*  you know, as a self justification, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4237.86s)]
*  but they know, you know, it's gold to them, you know? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4240.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4244.78s)]
*  You know, another mass shooting. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4246.02s)]
*  That's another thing that gets me [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4248.22s)]
*  or why does that dominate the news for days, right? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4250.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4256.58s)]
*  It's always the same stuff. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4257.42s)]
*  Or even in like, I live in LA, freeway chases, right? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4258.42s)]
*  The guy stole a car, the helicopter's following him [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4263.02s)]
*  as he goes through, you know, all the communities [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4266.22s)]
*  and the cops are after him. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4268.22s)]
*  And like everything else that's on the air [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4269.62s)]
*  is like blown off the air completely while we watch that. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4271.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4275.26s)]
*  It's just resistance, if you ask me. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4276.099999999999s)]
*  Well, it certainly is a thing that could get away from you [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4278.34s)]
*  and you could just get completely absorbed [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4283.78s)]
*  with all the negative aspects of the world [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4286.34s)]
*  and not concentrate on your own life. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4288.54s)]
*  Not concentrate on the things that you actually can control. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4290.62s)]
*  But the thing is like, should you be a civic minded person [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4294.0199999999995s)]
*  who's like concerned about the world? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4296.66s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4299.339999999999s)]
*  The stewards of the land and all that good stuff. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4300.179999999999s)]
*  How much? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4301.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4302.459999999999s)]
*  How much to the dominance of whatever it is. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4303.299999999999s)]
*  Isn't that maybe what's emerging, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4306.099999999999s)]
*  this understanding of the world as a whole? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4308.62s)]
*  Maybe it's a part of a thing [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4311.259999999999s)]
*  where we're not quite good at it yet. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4312.82s)]
*  But we're getting an understanding. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4315.0199999999995s)]
*  We're overwhelmed by it now. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4317.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4318.58s)]
*  But that we are all connected in this way. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4319.419999999999s)]
*  And you know, there's also an awareness like, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4321.94s)]
*  if you buy, like someone sent me a video yesterday, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4324.9s)]
*  my friend David Lucas sent me a video yesterday [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4327.98s)]
*  of these kids working in a factory. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4330.7s)]
*  And we kind of all know that in some countries, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4333.86s)]
*  kids work in factories. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4340.099999999999s)]
*  But when you see a video of these Chinese kids [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4341.78s)]
*  working in a factory and you look at them like, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4345.74s)]
*  how old's that kid? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4348.58s)]
*  Is that kid 12? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4349.78s)]
*  Are they 11? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4351.379999999999s)]
*  What's going on there? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4352.9s)]
*  And you see them doing this hard labor, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4353.98s)]
*  often 16, 18 hours a day in this factory. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4357.26s)]
*  It's very disturbing. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4360.42s)]
*  Cause then it makes you think like, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4361.66s)]
*  oh my goodness, what products am I buying [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4363.1s)]
*  that are being made in this factory? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4366.06s)]
*  And what am I contributing to? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4369.1s)]
*  And you can be overwhelmed with grief and with guilt. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4371.18s)]
*  But should you? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4377.26s)]
*  Or should you just be blissfully unaware [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4378.1s)]
*  and buy your iPhone? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4380.34s)]
*  Take it beyond that and forget about just the children. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4381.62s)]
*  What about the grownups that are in factories? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4384.7s)]
*  Or I was just earlier today, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4387.7s)]
*  I was hanging out with Ryan Holiday [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4390.38s)]
*  and he was giving a talk. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4392.62s)]
*  I love Ryan. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4394.0599999999995s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4394.9s)]
*  He was here just a little. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4395.74s)]
*  He was giving a talk to a bank group at the Marriott. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4398.3s)]
*  So it's one of those ballrooms, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4402.78s)]
*  where there are tables, table, tables, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4404.74s)]
*  and it's probably 250, 300 people and they're executives, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4406.26s)]
*  men and women. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4409.94s)]
*  And I'm thinking to myself, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4411.46s)]
*  thank God I'm not one of these guys. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4414.66s)]
*  And I feel, but that is, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4417.46s)]
*  in modern industrial society, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4420.38s)]
*  what the fuck is that? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4423.22s)]
*  What is that? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4424.86s)]
*  I mean, what is that? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4425.7s)]
*  Thank God that you have your podcasts [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4427.14s)]
*  and all the other stuff, right? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4429.54s)]
*  You would never sit still for that in your own life. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4430.86s)]
*  You would never do that, right? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4432.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, I mean, maybe I would if I was raised that way [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4434.34s)]
*  and I fell into that path, which I think. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4437.22s)]
*  It's a fucked situation. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4439.58s)]
*  We take it for granted, right? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4442.14s)]
*  Because we're brainwashed from day one in kindergarten. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4442.9800000000005s)]
*  But if Plato were to walk onto this scene [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4447.38s)]
*  or an ancient Spartan or somebody would appear, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4451.9400000000005s)]
*  they'd look around and go, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4454.34s)]
*  what the fuck is this? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4455.18s)]
*  Let me get back to where I was. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4456.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, one of the things that I, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4461.22s)]
*  when I was reading a bunch of, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4464.34s)]
*  I got into a kick for about a year and a half [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4465.820000000001s)]
*  where I read many books about Native American culture [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4468.06s)]
*  and what happened when the settlers made their way [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4472.34s)]
*  across the United States. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4475.740000000001s)]
*  And one of the things that's fascinating is [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4477.06s)]
*  there was a bunch of people, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4479.02s)]
*  whether they were trappers or soldiers [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4481.34s)]
*  or just regular civilians that gave up on modern life [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4484.46s)]
*  and were incorporated into Native American cultures. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4489.38s)]
*  They wound up living with the Native Americans. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4492.780000000001s)]
*  Some of them were even kidnapped [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4495.3s)]
*  by the Native Americans when they were young [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4497.26s)]
*  and then recaptured by the Americans [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4499.5s)]
*  and brought back to quote unquote civilization. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4503.3s)]
*  They all wanted to go back. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4506.9400000000005s)]
*  They all wanted to go back to a man. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4508.62s)]
*  No one from that tribe wanted to join modern civilization, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4511.900000000001s)]
*  but everyone from modern civilization [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4516.46s)]
*  wanted to be a part of that tribe. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4518.820000000001s)]
*  Once they were incorporated in it [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4521.26s)]
*  and they lived that life for a while, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4523.42s)]
*  there's something about it that was far more satisfying [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4525.18s)]
*  and far more, it resonated with them in a way that, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4528.26s)]
*  and even then, I mean, this very primitive society, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4532.860000000001s)]
*  we're talking about 1860s America, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4535.46s)]
*  but that was not exciting. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4537.700000000001s)]
*  That was not satisfying. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4540.62s)]
*  That was not what they wanted to do. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4541.780000000001s)]
*  They wanted to live off the land. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4543.26s)]
*  They wanted to be traveling. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4544.860000000001s)]
*  Can we go back to that? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4549.1s)]
*  I don't know if we can go back to that. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4550.54s)]
*  I don't think there's any going back. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4552.42s)]
*  But it does seem to be the way [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4553.7s)]
*  that the human being is the happiest. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4556.54s)]
*  Well, I think it's the way we evolved. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4558.58s)]
*  And these human reward systems are just sort of ingrained [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4560.62s)]
*  in the fiber of our being. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4565.5s)]
*  And the reward systems are, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4567.74s)]
*  there's a feeling that you get when you catch a fish. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4570.0599999999995s)]
*  You ever go fishing? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4571.94s)]
*  I have, but I'm not good at it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4572.86s)]
*  You don't have to be good at it, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4575.58s)]
*  but there's a feeling that you get [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4576.42s)]
*  when you get a big fish on the line. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4577.94s)]
*  It's so exciting. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4579.94s)]
*  Well, what is that feeling? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4581.0599999999995s)]
*  The feeling is you're gonna be able to feed your family. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4582.06s)]
*  So you're rewarded for being successful at that [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4584.38s)]
*  with not just food, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4587.9400000000005s)]
*  but also with this rush of endorphins [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4589.38s)]
*  and these great feelings. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4591.5s)]
*  And that's what people pursue when they go fishing. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4592.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's so much so that there's like a perversion of it [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4595.740000000001s)]
*  where people do catch and release fishing [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4600.14s)]
*  just to get a thrill. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4602.780000000001s)]
*  So there's tournaments and these guys go out there [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4604.34s)]
*  and they cast a line [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4607.540000000001s)]
*  and they even have a live well on their boat [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4609.18s)]
*  where they take the fish [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4612.38s)]
*  and they put it in this aerated pool on their boat [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4613.42s)]
*  where the fish stay alive so they can weigh them [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4616.62s)]
*  and win the tournament. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4619.26s)]
*  And then they release them back into the lake, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4620.26s)]
*  which is kind of crazy. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4623.34s)]
*  But they've hijacked this feeling that you get [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4625.06s)]
*  that is a part of being a person [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4631.62s)]
*  because that feeling was to reward you [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4633.54s)]
*  with being able to feed your family. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4636.54s)]
*  And within the tribe where it's your uncle and your cousin [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4638.74s)]
*  and your daughter and your mom and everybody's together. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4643.34s)]
*  Everybody's together. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4646.0199999999995s)]
*  Like the movie Dances with Wolves. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4647.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4649.3s)]
*  They really hit that one with a nail on the head [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4651.3s)]
*  with that one. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4653.5s)]
*  Yes, that's a great example of that with that movie. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4654.34s)]
*  But the reality of that, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4657.78s)]
*  that life is so much more satisfying [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4662.0599999999995s)]
*  than the life of being a banker. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4664.0199999999995s)]
*  When you're a banker, I'm not a banker, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4666.98s)]
*  but I would imagine your reward is [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4669.7s)]
*  you're always looking for new things to buy. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4673.14s)]
*  So you're making enough money [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4676.38s)]
*  that one day you're gonna get a yacht. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4677.54s)]
*  One day you're gonna get that Ferrari. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4679.46s)]
*  One day you're gonna get that jet. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4682.0199999999995s)]
*  One day you're gonna get that bigger house. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4684.1s)]
*  You're gonna get to a point where, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4687.06s)]
*  hey, you make enough money, maybe you can buy an island. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4688.58s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4691.14s)]
*  If you got an island, like Tyler Perry has an island. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4691.98s)]
*  Oh, he's ballin'. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4695.06s)]
*  That guy's got an island. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4696.9800000000005s)]
*  You hear about people with an island, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4698.740000000001s)]
*  that's ultimate ballin'. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4700.06s)]
*  He's got a jet, got an island, got a boat, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4701.540000000001s)]
*  got a this, got a that. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4703.900000000001s)]
*  And you just, Tyler Perry's obviously creative. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4704.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm not talking about him, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4707.5s)]
*  but when talking about someone who's a person [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4708.34s)]
*  who's just acquiring numbers, just acquiring currency, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4711.34s)]
*  and then what's your reward? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4716.740000000001s)]
*  What do you get out of that? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4718.14s)]
*  Maybe you get to play golf on the weekend, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4719.5s)]
*  and what do you do when you play golf? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4721.14s)]
*  You're talking about your objects, your things. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4722.26s)]
*  And things you're acquiring. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4725.66s)]
*  Have you seen the newest that? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4726.98s)]
*  Oh, I'm trying to get one on the waiting list. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4728.38s)]
*  That's where their good feelings come from. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4732.74s)]
*  That is the subversion. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4735.38s)]
*  That's the hijacking of those positive feelings [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4736.98s)]
*  of accomplishment like you get when you're fishing. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4741.46s)]
*  For them, it's accomplishing something [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4744.38s)]
*  even more difficult to get, like a yacht. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4747.62s)]
*  And then it's just this trick, this biological trick [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4750.54s)]
*  that's forcing them to keep slaving away [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4754.26s)]
*  under fluorescent lights for 16 hours a day. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4757.14s)]
*  I don't know if we're ever gonna evolve to some way [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4760.22s)]
*  where we can kinda get back to something like that [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4762.820000000001s)]
*  in some sort of form. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4765.42s)]
*  Not literally, but sports in some way, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4767.42s)]
*  when they're not perverted into these giant things [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4773.02s)]
*  like the NFL and everything like that, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4775.42s)]
*  are at least a way of artificially [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4777.740000000001s)]
*  acting out the chase, or the tribal, the team. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4784.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's a modern way that sort of taps into [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4790.66s)]
*  those ancient needs, those evolutionary needs. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4794.54s)]
*  I wonder if we can ever get to that [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4797.5s)]
*  on some culture-wide scale. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4800.06s)]
*  We certainly don't seem to be. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4803.18s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4804.58s)]
*  As billions and billions of people. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4806.02s)]
*  Well, it seems like there's so many people [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4809.18s)]
*  that are living that way. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4811.1s)]
*  More people are living that way than not living that way. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4812.66s)]
*  If you did a survey of all the people and their occupation [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4815.74s)]
*  and the enjoyment level of their job [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4821.78s)]
*  and what they look forward to, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4825.46s)]
*  I would imagine the majority of people [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4827.5s)]
*  do not enjoy what they're doing, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4829.74s)]
*  and they're sort of stuck. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4831.9s)]
*  And they're just doing a thing for money, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4833.86s)]
*  and they don't find it rewarding. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4836.7s)]
*  I would agree. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4838.38s)]
*  And they probably have a hobby or a pastime or a love [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4839.22s)]
*  that they're working to be able to do whatever that is. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4844.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing that excites them. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4849.26s)]
*  They get off work and they go fucking axe throwing [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4852.26s)]
*  or something, whatever the thing that they're into. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4855.62s)]
*  But what is sort of interesting to me, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4857.66s)]
*  and it is kind of hopeful to be on some level, Joe, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4859.02s)]
*  is that there are a lot of people that are taking [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4861.06s)]
*  those individual passions and making them businesses. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4863.22s)]
*  Like I'll go back to the idea of designing motorcycles. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4867.94s)]
*  I'm sure that there are guys that love making up [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4870.94s)]
*  some crazy kind of motorcycle. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4874.74s)]
*  They're artists, right? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4877.219999999999s)]
*  And they somehow find a way to have that garage [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4878.74s)]
*  and to do it and to sell it and to make it. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4881.62s)]
*  And usually the whole family is part of it, right? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4884.259999999999s)]
*  The mom, the daughters, everybody gets into it. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4886.74s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of that going on now. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4888.94s)]
*  It's kind of on an underground level [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4891.74s)]
*  that doesn't get into the papers or anything. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4894.099999999999s)]
*  But I think that that gives me some hope. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4896.3s)]
*  There's a lot of kind of mom and pop people [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4899.3s)]
*  following their dreams, even if they're kind of, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4901.78s)]
*  they're not global dreams, but they're certainly dreams [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4904.38s)]
*  that satisfy the soul in one way or another. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4908.34s)]
*  They certainly don't have to be global. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4912.78s)]
*  If you're making motorcycles and you start doing it [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4914.22s)]
*  in your garage and then you post a few on social media [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4917.820000000001s)]
*  and someone says, hey, I'd love to buy one [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4920.860000000001s)]
*  of your motorcycles, then all of a sudden [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4922.5s)]
*  you've got a project to sell. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4923.900000000001s)]
*  What an feeling that must be the first one you sell. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4925.22s)]
*  Yeah, and then because of the internet, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4928.34s)]
*  I mean this is probably one of the more positive things [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4931.14s)]
*  about the internet. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4933.02s)]
*  Because of the internet, people can find you. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4934.1s)]
*  And you actually can move from having [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4936.740000000001s)]
*  this very unsatisfactory job to doing something [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4940.06s)]
*  that you truly enjoy. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4943.18s)]
*  Maybe you start off as, you know, you're making woodwork. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4944.9400000000005s)]
*  You're making tables and various projects [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4948.9400000000005s)]
*  and you post them on Instagram [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4953.46s)]
*  and all of a sudden people want to buy them. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4955.3s)]
*  Now you got orders. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4957.42s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, I'm thinking of quitting the job. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4958.38s)]
*  Then you and the wife have to have a conversation. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4961.02s)]
*  Like, is this sustainable? [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4962.86s)]
*  Can we really do this? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4964.46s)]
*  And well, I'll tell you what, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4965.62s)]
*  let's give ourselves six months [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4967.14s)]
*  and I'm gonna work on it part-time on nights and weekends [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4968.9s)]
*  and it'll be worth the sacrifice. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4971.9s)]
*  And you know, I think I could really get to a point [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4973.7s)]
*  where we can have a real way of life [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4976.82s)]
*  that is very satisfying. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4979.46s)]
*  Like if you go from being a person who works in a bank, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4981.42s)]
*  this boring, unsatisfying version of reality [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4985.02s)]
*  that so many people are trapped in, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4989.9400000000005s)]
*  to all of a sudden you're painting [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4991.78s)]
*  and your paintings are selling [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4994.06s)]
*  and you have a gallery opening and your stuff is selling [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4996.38s)]
*  and you're like, oh my goodness, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=4999.82s)]
*  I think I can make a living painting. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5001.3s)]
*  Like what a much more satisfying [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5003.02s)]
*  and exciting way of life that is. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5005.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm a believer, as you know, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5007.5s)]
*  from what I've talked about the muse and stuff like that, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5010.86s)]
*  that through each of us is flowing an underground river [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5013.9s)]
*  and that river is unique to us and it's our creativity. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5020.62s)]
*  Let's say it's the guy with the motorcycles [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5024.78s)]
*  or it's a guy that wants to paint low rider cars [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5026.7s)]
*  that just has our design low rider cars [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5029.66s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5031.94s)]
*  And that is flowing through us. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5033.099999999999s)]
*  And if we don't do it, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5036.82s)]
*  if we stay working in the bank or doing whatever it is, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5041.219999999999s)]
*  if we yield to our resistance and our fear [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5044.219999999999s)]
*  and we don't do that, that river doesn't go away. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5048.82s)]
*  That underground river doesn't go away. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5053.54s)]
*  It flows into another channel, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5055.62s)]
*  flows into a negative channel, right? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5057.38s)]
*  And it starts to fuck us up, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5059.42s)]
*  physically, emotionally, psychologically. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5061.46s)]
*  But if we do let it flow, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5063.78s)]
*  and pretty soon the whole family gets involved in it, right? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5066.86s)]
*  And we've now created now this energy, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5070.3s)]
*  which you could call God energy, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5073.34s)]
*  it's coming from some other place, right? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5074.86s)]
*  Is helping everybody. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5077.099999999999s)]
*  Everybody's feeding off of it. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5079.34s)]
*  And I'm encouraged that there are more people doing that [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5081.0199999999995s)]
*  than I think there ever were. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5085.94s)]
*  Because of the internet, like you say, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5087.259999999999s)]
*  because of the fact that you can find a market, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5089.179999999999s)]
*  you can let people be aware of what you're doing [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5092.3s)]
*  and people will come to you and will buy your shit. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5095.14s)]
*  So God bless everybody that's doing that. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5098.18s)]
*  Everybody that does it, don't stop. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5101.1s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if it's for everybody, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5104.42s)]
*  because there's some people out there [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5106.860000000001s)]
*  that truly don't have interests. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5107.9800000000005s)]
*  They don't have a thing that excites them, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5109.58s)]
*  which is very unfortunate. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5111.06s)]
*  What is that? Is that nature or nurture? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5112.58s)]
*  I'm not so sure about that. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5114.22s)]
*  I kind of believe that, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5115.62s)]
*  maybe not everybody has like a specific art [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5117.22s)]
*  that they wanna do, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5120.46s)]
*  but they have some gift. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5121.66s)]
*  I'm thinking about a friend of mine, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5124.38s)]
*  a woman who's been a really good friend of mine forever [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5125.78s)]
*  and has never really worked. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5128.5s)]
*  She's always been married, she's never had a job, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5130.26s)]
*  da da da da da da. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5132.34s)]
*  But I realized watching her life [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5133.9s)]
*  that her calling is she's like one of those people [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5136.34s)]
*  that of her extended family and friends, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5139.0199999999995s)]
*  she's the one that holds everything together. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5143.34s)]
*  She's the one that when somebody gets pregnant over here, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5146.26s)]
*  an unwanted pregnancy, they go to my friend [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5149.5s)]
*  and she kind of pulls them together somehow. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5152.46s)]
*  If there's a death in the family, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5154.78s)]
*  if there's something like that, right? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5156.22s)]
*  So that's her calling. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5158.06s)]
*  Maybe she's not making movies or something like that, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5160.7s)]
*  but that's her gift and it's a real gift. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5164.7s)]
*  So I do believe that everybody's got something like that. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5169.74s)]
*  Well, that was probably a traditional role in communities. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5172.9s)]
*  Yeah, it probably was. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5176.3s)]
*  They probably had a name for it. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5177.78s)]
*  Maybe she'd be the Chaminesse or something like that. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5179.7s)]
*  And it's very valuable. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5183.46s)]
*  If you're a person that's in a troubled spot [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5185.7s)]
*  and there's a person who's really good [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5187.86s)]
*  at navigating troubled spots in the community, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5189.7s)]
*  that's a very valuable position. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5192.62s)]
*  And for that person, who is that person, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5194.66s)]
*  it's probably very satisfying to be able [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5196.5s)]
*  to help all those people. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5198.259999999999s)]
*  And what's sort of a little sad about that for my friend [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5199.74s)]
*  is that she really doesn't get the credit that she deserves. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5202.54s)]
*  She should get a lot of credit. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5205.5s)]
*  They should have a dinner for her once a year. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5206.74s)]
*  They should come to her house. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5209.5s)]
*  And I know even she has saved me at least three times [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5210.5s)]
*  from bad shit by just intervening [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5215.0599999999995s)]
*  and just coming in and saying, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5219.5s)]
*  don't worry, I'll take care of this. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5220.62s)]
*  I'll take care of it. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5222.139999999999s)]
*  And she has. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5222.98s)]
*  And I know she's done it for many, many others. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5223.82s)]
*  Nice. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5226.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's a thing. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5227.46s)]
*  And it doesn't have to be a thing [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5230.099999999999s)]
*  that you get a paycheck for. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5231.9s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a thing [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5233.74s)]
*  where you get a little plaque on your desk. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5234.66s)]
*  And it's probably a tribal thing, right? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5236.74s)]
*  In Dances with Wolves, there probably was [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5238.34s)]
*  one of the women that was doing that thing, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5240.46s)]
*  or a man, whatever. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5242.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5243.66s)]
*  Well, the title of my last tour was The Sacred Clown, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5244.82s)]
*  because there's a role in the Lakota people. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5251.94s)]
*  Called the Heyoka. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5256.82s)]
*  And the Heyoka, the person's job was to make fun [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5258.62s)]
*  of all the things that were there, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5262.82s)]
*  whether it was the biggest warrior, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5265.9s)]
*  or the chief, or everything. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5268.46s)]
*  They made fun of everything, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5270.54s)]
*  because the idea was that anything [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5271.42s)]
*  that could not be mocked was bullshit. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5274.139999999999s)]
*  And you had to figure out what was bullshit. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5277.46s)]
*  That's great. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5279.54s)]
*  It was important to know what was real [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5280.38s)]
*  and what was important and what was truly significant. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5281.9s)]
*  And if you couldn't make fun of it, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5285.5s)]
*  it was like, hey, don't make fun of that. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5286.94s)]
*  Don't make fun of me. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5288.66s)]
*  Like you knew that person was inflated by ego, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5290.58s)]
*  and there was a way of letting out the hot air, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5294.62s)]
*  and all the windbags, and letting them know [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5298.34s)]
*  that you know they're full of shit. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5301.74s)]
*  That was a valuable role in the culture. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5303.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5306.1s)]
*  So now you have comedians, Stephen Colbert, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5306.94s)]
*  somebody like that, right, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5310.5s)]
*  that takes the piss out of somebody. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5311.54s)]
*  That's great, yeah. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5313.22s)]
*  That's a role. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5314.42s)]
*  It's definitely a role. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5315.54s)]
*  That's a role that's not often acknowledged and rewarded, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5316.38s)]
*  and should be. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5320.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5321.42s)]
*  The role of a counselor, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5322.54s)]
*  someone who can counsel you through things, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5324.34s)]
*  the role of someone who can sort of coach you through life [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5327.06s)]
*  because they've gone through the same shit [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5330.66s)]
*  that you've gone through, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5332.26s)]
*  and they have some valuable information they can share [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5333.18s)]
*  to make your journey quicker and easier, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5335.860000000001s)]
*  and maybe you can now impart that to young people [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5338.42s)]
*  that you see coming up that are struggling [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5342.06s)]
*  in a very similar way. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5344.14s)]
*  What do you see for yourself, Joe, like on your podcast? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5345.9800000000005s)]
*  Do you feel like you're performing [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5348.42s)]
*  a kind of a service like that? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5349.82s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5351.18s)]
*  I think you are. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5352.22s)]
*  Well, that's very nice of you. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5353.86s)]
*  I think you absolutely are. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5355.82s)]
*  I'm sure people benefit from it. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5357.26s)]
*  I benefit from it. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5360.34s)]
*  Don't be too modest now, you know? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5361.18s)]
*  But I don't think of it that way. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5363.02s)]
*  I think if I did, it would just get in the way. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5364.86s)]
*  You might be inflated, yeah. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5367.1s)]
*  It would just get in the way. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5368.5s)]
*  There's no value for me pondering [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5369.62s)]
*  what great things I've done. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5372.82s)]
*  There's zero value in that. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5374.34s)]
*  In fact, there's just nothing but pitfalls. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5375.54s)]
*  There's value in, and I have the same issue myself, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5378.860000000001s)]
*  but there's value in valuing what you are giving [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5382.06s)]
*  and what you are doing, and really just not inflating it, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5386.780000000001s)]
*  but seeing it for what it is. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5389.820000000001s)]
*  God bless you, you are doing a lot of good shit. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5391.58s)]
*  Well, thank you, but I don't think that's something [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5393.38s)]
*  to concentrate on. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5396.5s)]
*  With my mind and my ego and who I am as a human, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5398.740000000001s)]
*  how that works, there's no value in that. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5403.58s)]
*  The value is in- [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5405.860000000001s)]
*  I'm the same way I'm in. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5406.700000000001s)]
*  I know that I'm helping people with my sort of war of art [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5407.54s)]
*  and stuff like that, but I also don't want to think [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5410.62s)]
*  about that, and I certainly don't want to be in that role. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5412.66s)]
*  But I must acknowledge, if I say, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5415.42s)]
*  okay, I'm doing a little something good here, so okay. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5418.7s)]
*  I think the reason, well, I know I'm not doing bad, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5422.34s)]
*  which is nice, but I think the value is in [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5425.58s)]
*  what I do my best is when I just think about [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5434.34s)]
*  the thing I'm doing and try to do my best, that's it. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5436.82s)]
*  To think about, look how good you've done. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5440.219999999999s)]
*  That shit is no good, that's no good. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5442.94s)]
*  That's like reading, I tell comedians in particular, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5444.86s)]
*  I say stop reading comments, don't read comments. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5447.58s)]
*  And don't even read positive comments, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5450.299999999999s)]
*  because positive comments you think are good, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5452.139999999999s)]
*  but they're not good, because now you're captured [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5453.9s)]
*  by other people's praise and opinions of you and all that. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5457.58s)]
*  That's just wasted time. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5461.66s)]
*  You're just getting in your own way. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5463.179999999999s)]
*  You should know if you're doing good work, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5464.58s)]
*  and you should know if, you know, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5466.18s)]
*  if there's a little bit of feedback is good, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5468.3s)]
*  a little bit of positive or negative, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5470.1s)]
*  and you get to, oh, people didn't like that. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5471.900000000001s)]
*  Why didn't they like that? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5473.820000000001s)]
*  You know what, they were right. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5474.820000000001s)]
*  This is why they didn't like it. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5476.3s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of sloppy. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5477.58s)]
*  Oh, maybe I should have taken more time with that, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5479.06s)]
*  or maybe I should have thought that out better, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5480.66s)]
*  or maybe I should have looked at it [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5482.18s)]
*  from other perspectives. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5483.46s)]
*  And you can genuinely learn and grow from that, no doubt. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5484.58s)]
*  But at a certain point in time, it's too much, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5488.26s)]
*  and it gets in the way. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5490.860000000001s)]
*  The positive or the negative, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5493.18s)]
*  and I've seen people crippled by negative critiques, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5494.82s)]
*  negative comments, and all these people [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5498.0199999999995s)]
*  with their emotional poison just spraying it on everybody [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5499.62s)]
*  they come into contact with. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5504.0199999999995s)]
*  And those are not necessarily the type of people, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5505.98s)]
*  the type of people that do that are not the type of people [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5508.82s)]
*  that you would be happy to interact with. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5511.38s)]
*  Those people that say hateful things to people online, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5513.7s)]
*  they're genuinely like damaged and unhealthy people. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5517.139999999999s)]
*  That's the only way you're capable [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5521.219999999999s)]
*  of saying horrible things to people [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5523.66s)]
*  you don't even know online. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5525.42s)]
*  You have to be damaged. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5526.82s)]
*  Like you were saying that we wanted to pretend [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5528.38s)]
*  that we're separate, and that when you do something [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5530.42s)]
*  evil to a person that has no effect on you, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5534.0599999999995s)]
*  but that's not true. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5536.58s)]
*  It most certainly has an effect. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5538.0199999999995s)]
*  We are all connected. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5539.82s)]
*  And when people are leaving horrible comments [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5541.74s)]
*  on someone's YouTube video, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5545.86s)]
*  or horrible comments on Twitter, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5547.0599999999995s)]
*  they are damaged people. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5549.7s)]
*  They're deeply damaged people. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5551.34s)]
*  And they're trying to get you to feel the way they feel. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5554.02s)]
*  They feel like shit. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5557.42s)]
*  So they want you to feel like shit. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5559.14s)]
*  And you can just simply not take that in. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5561.22s)]
*  Don't get involved in that. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5564.1s)]
*  But also don't get involved in the praise either. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5566.02s)]
*  Don't start believing the bullshit [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5568.860000000001s)]
*  and believe in your own hype. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5570.54s)]
*  I just concentrate on doing things. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5572.3s)]
*  I concentrate on just trying to get better. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5574.22s)]
*  And it's nice when people show up for my shows [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5576.38s)]
*  and it's nice the podcast is successful. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5578.38s)]
*  That's great. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5580.54s)]
*  But I don't think about it at all. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5581.38s)]
*  I just work. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5583.9400000000005s)]
*  Now I would say, just as a sidebar here [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5585.620000000001s)]
*  about the people that write hateful things, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5587.820000000001s)]
*  that that's their own resistance. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5590.820000000001s)]
*  That's where that's coming from. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5593.34s)]
*  Like if they see a comic that's succeeding or anybody else, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5595.1s)]
*  what's really happening is they have a dream, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5599.780000000001s)]
*  whether they could articulate it or not, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5603.900000000001s)]
*  and they're not enacting it in any way. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5607.06s)]
*  They're not doing a sober October in any way. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5610.06s)]
*  So they see you or they see somebody else succeeding, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5612.54s)]
*  and it's just like a terrible reproach to them. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5615.86s)]
*  It's like, how can Joe do that shit? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5618.26s)]
*  It's on the unconscious level. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5620.62s)]
*  They're not aware of it, right? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5622.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5623.38s)]
*  He's doing something and I'm not. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5624.22s)]
*  And so they really hate themselves [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5626.86s)]
*  and they project that outward. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5629.34s)]
*  And I know this is true because I've gotten [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5631.26s)]
*  those shitty letters from people [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5633.7s)]
*  and shitty emails from people. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5635.46s)]
*  And when I've engaged with them at all, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5636.94s)]
*  which I rarely do, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5639.06s)]
*  it's only one or two exchanges before they'll admit, [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5641.3s)]
*  you know, I really felt, I really hated you [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5644.860000000001s)]
*  because I thought you were doing something. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5647.3s)]
*  I've got a book in me and I wish I had written [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5648.9400000000005s)]
*  and I hadn't written and that's why. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5650.780000000001s)]
*  And then they'll actually will become friendly, you know? [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5652.580000000001s)]
*  And I'm so sorry I wrote that to you. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5657.34s)]
*  I really didn't mean writing it to you. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5658.9400000000005s)]
*  So I think that's, if you think about the phenomenon [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5660.900000000001s)]
*  of resistance on a sort of national or global level, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5664.740000000001s)]
*  like it's a big thing, you know? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5668.78s)]
*  A lot of polarization, what we call that shit, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5672.78s)]
*  really comes on an individual level [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5676.38s)]
*  from that sort of thing, from people that know [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5679.219999999999s)]
*  they have a gift or a dream or something [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5682.38s)]
*  and know even unconsciously that they're not doing it. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5686.139999999999s)]
*  And they hate themselves for that. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5690.46s)]
*  They feel bad, you know? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5692.54s)]
*  As anybody would, right? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5693.9s)]
*  I'm drinking too much, I'm getting fat, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5695.98s)]
*  I'm not doing, you know? [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5698.14s)]
*  And so, but it's impossible for most people [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5699.42s)]
*  to accept that about themselves and say, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5703.1s)]
*  oh, I'm really fucking up, you know? [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5706.14s)]
*  So they project it onto some other group, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5708.38s)]

*  Yeah, they just don't have the tools yet. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5714.5s)]
*  No one's provided them with the tools. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5716.700000000001s)]
*  There's a great quote, I forget who said it, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5719.22s)]
*  but I've said it ad nauseum, that all criticism [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5721.26s)]
*  is the tragic result of unmet needs. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5725.06s)]
*  There's like something more to that. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5729.14s)]
*  Who wrote that quote? [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5730.3s)]
*  Someone wrote that, see if we can find that. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5731.22s)]
*  Because there's more to it, but that resonates. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5733.46s)]
*  That that's the reason why people get shitty. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5736.660000000001s)]
*  It's like, I always say, the people that are killing it [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5739.06s)]
*  in life, they're not, you think LeBron James [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5742.42s)]

*  and fucking with people? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5749.780000000001s)]
*  Every criticism, judgment, diagnosis, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5751.58s)]
*  and expression of anger is the tragic expression [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5755.14s)]
*  of an unmet need. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5758.780000000001s)]
*  And this is Marshall Rosenberg. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5760.9400000000005s)]
*  What a great quote. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5763.820000000001s)]
*  That is such a great quote. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5765.38s)]
*  Now I would take it a step beyond that. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5767.18s)]
*  And it seems like when you say an unmet need, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5769.700000000001s)]
*  that the person is waiting for someone else [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5772.9400000000005s)]
*  or some other force to supply their quote unquote need. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5775.900000000001s)]
*  I would say they aren't, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5780.38s)]
*  they aren't addressing that need themselves. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5783.820000000001s)]
*  They aren't aware of it [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5787.18s)]
*  and they aren't doing anything about it. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5788.66s)]
*  And that's where that anger and that hatred comes from. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5791.18s)]
*  Click there where it says the top 25 [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5794.06s)]
*  because it goes even further. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5796.3s)]
*  There's another, at the root of every tantrum [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5799.42s)]
*  and power struggle are unmet needs. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5803.38s)]
*  And that's another Marshall Rosenberg quote. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5806.26s)]
*  I don't like the whole phrase unmet needs [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5808.18s)]
*  because it feels to me like we're projecting out [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5810.66s)]
*  to somebody else expecting them to come [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5814.58s)]
*  and satisfy us in some way. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5817.58s)]
*  And that's not the answer I don't think. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5821.46s)]
*  The answer is sober October [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5825.1s)]
*  and you yourself addressing that need, whatever it is. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5827.3s)]
*  Oh, most certainly that's the answer. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5831.14s)]
*  But I think by saying unmet needs is like they feel [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5833.06s)]
*  they're supposed to get something that they're not getting. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5837.099999999999s)]
*  True, I agree with that. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5838.98s)]
*  But it says what is gonna address that? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5840.26s)]
*  Well, that's one of the things that makes me feel like [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5843.26s)]
*  when I'm on the right path [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5846.38s)]
*  that all I'm thinking about is what I'm doing [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5848.34s)]
*  and I'm not even remotely concerned with getting praise [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5850.7s)]
*  or getting anything else for it [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5855.94s)]
*  because all I'm thinking about is doing the thing [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5859.0599999999995s)]
*  because I don't have unmet needs. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5861.179999999999s)]
*  So my cup is full. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5863.94s)]
*  All I'm thinking about is the work. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5867.38s)]
*  I don't wanna be recognized. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5870.86s)]
*  I'd rather not be recognized. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5871.94s)]
*  I'd rather be able to sneak through a restaurant [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5873.3s)]
*  and have no one know who I am. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5875.0599999999995s)]
*  That's one of the things I like about traveling overseas. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5876.62s)]
*  It's nice. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5878.82s)]
*  I could just slip around. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5879.94s)]
*  So that is because I've been doing the thing [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5882.26s)]
*  that I wanna do for so long. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5885.54s)]
*  All my needs are met in that regard. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5887.82s)]
*  The accomplishments have been cemented [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5889.94s)]
*  and all the praise and all the success. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5893.0199999999995s)]
*  It's all great. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5895.54s)]
*  But now I don't think about it at all. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5897.54s)]
*  Instead of living in that world [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5898.38s)]
*  of constantly trying to get more and more and more praise [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5900.14s)]
*  and becoming megalomaniac, I go the other way. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5902.9s)]
*  All I think about is just what I'm doing. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5907.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'm the same way. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5909.54s)]
*  Well, that's a very healthy way. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5911.74s)]
*  I'm definitely a believer from that [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5912.58s)]
*  the work is its own reward. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5915.86s)]
*  And when you're doing it right, whatever it is, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5918.0199999999995s)]
*  making motorcycles, whatever it is, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5921.7s)]
*  because it's tapped into that other level, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5926.62s)]
*  you're getting a salary in some coin [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5929.58s)]
*  that the gods have minted. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5934.26s)]
*  And you don't need a salary from the regular world. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5936.7s)]
*  Well, it's also from a resource management perspective, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5940.54s)]
*  it's much more efficient to think that way. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5943.42s)]
*  Because you'll- [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5947.78s)]
*  I never thought about it that way. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5948.62s)]
*  You'll get more things done [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5950.0199999999995s)]
*  and you'll get out of your own way. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5951.42s)]
*  And that's a big issue. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5953.54s)]
*  The getting out of your own way is a big issue. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5955.1s)]
*  How would you define that, Joe? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5958.22s)]
*  When you say, I know exactly what you mean, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5959.54s)]
*  but can you articulate that? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5962.780000000001s)]
*  What does it mean when you're in your own way? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5964.700000000001s)]
*  Well, your ego and your perception of yourself [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5967.54s)]
*  and how you're viewed by the world [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5973.620000000001s)]
*  is this fluctuating thing and you think about it too often [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5976.38s)]
*  and it gets in the way and maybe it flavors your art [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5982.38s)]
*  in a way where you're actively trying to get more respect [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5986.82s)]
*  or trying to change other people's perceptions of you [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5991.86s)]
*  and alter it. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5996.26s)]
*  You're getting in your own way. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5997.7s)]
*  And it's transparent to other people. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=5999.1s)]
*  It makes your art poor. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6001.26s)]
*  It makes your ego leaks over into, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6002.9400000000005s)]
*  whether it's your music or your writing, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6007.5s)]
*  whatever it is you're making. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6010.0599999999995s)]
*  And you get in your own way. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6011.7s)]
*  There's nothing sadder than someone [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6013.7s)]
*  who's brilliant at something. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6015.259999999999s)]
*  They're really good. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6017.299999999999s)]
*  Say they're great at making automobiles. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6018.459999999999s)]
*  They make the best cars. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6021.62s)]
*  But when you talk to them about it, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6022.66s)]
*  they brag about it so much it grosses you out [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6023.94s)]
*  you don't wanna buy their car. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6026.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, fuck that guy in his car. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6028.179999999999s)]
*  He's a genius, but I don't wanna talk to him. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6030.219999999999s)]
*  He's annoying. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6032.419999999999s)]
*  You're getting in your own way. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6034.099999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you, Joe, were you at any stage of your life [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6035.78s)]
*  in your own way? [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6039.66s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6040.5s)]
*  And how did you, was there a moment [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6041.34s)]
*  when you got out of your own way? [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6044.38s)]
*  I am my worst critic. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6047.0199999999995s)]
*  That's the best aspect about it. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6050.42s)]
*  I don't hate myself, but I am 100% my worst critic. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6052.3s)]
*  So I don't allow myself to bullshit myself. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6056.26s)]
*  And so if I have like mediocre results [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6060.66s)]
*  or unfavorable results, I take long, hard looks [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6064.42s)]
*  at what's causing that. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6069.22s)]
*  And if you do that long enough, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6071.26s)]
*  you'll get to the thing you're like, oh, I'm gross. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6072.900000000001s)]
*  I did this, that's gross. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6076.02s)]
*  I said that, that's gross. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6077.38s)]
*  Why did I say it like that? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6078.7s)]
*  What's wrong with me? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6080.18s)]
*  I can't do that. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6081.02s)]
*  I have to really understand what that is [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6082.34s)]
*  and why it's coming up and then figure out. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6083.9400000000005s)]
*  And luckily for me, because I'm a physical fitness [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6086.9800000000005s)]
*  enthusiast and I'm so obsessed with that, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6090.46s)]
*  I have these anxiety alleviation methods [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6093.02s)]
*  that are tried and true. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6099.26s)]
*  And in doing that and taxing the body in the way that I do, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6101.22s)]
*  it allows me this great insight [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6107.34s)]
*  because those moments of physical like exercise [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6109.7s)]
*  and martial arts training, they're so uncomfortable, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6113.14s)]
*  so difficult that it makes the other things [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6116.14s)]
*  seem much more trivial. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6118.860000000001s)]
*  And it makes them seem more, the stakes are lower. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6120.820000000001s)]
*  The stakes are lower. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6125.82s)]
*  They seem more clear for what the actual issue is. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6127.7s)]
*  And then I assess, I figure out what I'm doing wrong [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6131.98s)]
*  and I try to do it better. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6137.5s)]
*  And over time, I've realized there's certain patterns. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6138.5s)]
*  And one of those patterns is you get in your own way. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6142.179999999999s)]
*  You rely on your own ego. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6145.34s)]
*  You boost up your ego. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6148.179999999999s)]
*  You're looking to brag, you're looking to do this, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6150.82s)]
*  you're looking to like, you get in your own way. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6153.78s)]
*  Everybody knows when they're in their own way. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6157.54s)]
*  So if I'm hearing you right, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6159.5s)]
*  it's introspection in a way, right? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6162.94s)]
*  You're looking at yourself when you say gross [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6164.98s)]
*  and saying, I'm in my own way, my ego's taken over here. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6168.42s)]
*  And so that sort of witness mentality is saying, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6172.5s)]
*  I gotta stop that, right? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6176.7s)]
*  How can I stop that? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6178.58s)]
*  So that's how you did it, huh? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6180.219999999999s)]
*  Or do it. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6182.38s)]
*  So there wasn't any specific breakthrough moment [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6183.34s)]
*  or anything where you- [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6187.02s)]
*  Psychedelics helped tremendously for sure. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6187.9800000000005s)]
*  How? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6190.54s)]
*  Because they dissolve the ego. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6191.38s)]
*  When you do a very strong psychedelic trip, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6193.22s)]
*  one of the most profound aspects of it [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6197.38s)]
*  is the ego has completely dissolved. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6199.54s)]
*  You're faced with such beauty [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6202.02s)]
*  and wisdom of undeniable power [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6206.58s)]
*  that whatever that thing is that you encounter [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6213.78s)]
*  in the psychedelic dimension is so humbling [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6216.78s)]
*  and it dissolves your ego and brings you into it. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6219.74s)]
*  And for whatever amount of time while you're tripping, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6224.34s)]
*  you relinquish your grip on the material world [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6227.66s)]
*  and you take into account all these ideas. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6232.34s)]
*  There's this overwhelming theme of love and connectivity [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6235.9400000000005s)]
*  that most people have from these experiences. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6240.62s)]
*  And then when you come out of them, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6244.02s)]
*  the idea of bragging or the idea of dwelling [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6245.14s)]
*  on your accomplishments or looking for praise [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6249.1s)]
*  seems so preposterous. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6252.66s)]
*  It seems so ridiculous. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6254.780000000001s)]
*  Because you've got such an expansive perspective [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6256.740000000001s)]
*  on things now that you, your own self, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6260.22s)]
*  looked really tiny and ridiculous, right? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6262.58s)]
*  It's expansive, but it's also, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6264.66s)]
*  there's a physical act of dissolving the ego. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6266.14s)]
*  Like it really does take the ego away. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6271.62s)]
*  Those psychedelics, one of the best things that they do [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6275.3s)]
*  is they dissolve whatever that gross id is inside of you [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6278.5s)]
*  that makes you get in your own way. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6284.700000000001s)]
*  They help you see things in a far more introspective, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6288.740000000001s)]
*  a far clearer perspective [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6293.9400000000005s)]
*  and they let you look at things from a top-down view. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6295.660000000001s)]
*  Now, do you ever think, Joe, that when you're in that state, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6299.86s)]
*  that prior civilizations, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6304.74s)]
*  if we think of them as advanced civilizations [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6307.219999999999s)]
*  like the ancient Egyptians or somebody like that, [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6309.34s)]
*  that they somehow were able to live in that world [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6311.74s)]
*  or at least in a more time per day [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6315.94s)]
*  than we do today? Oh, there's clear evidence. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6320.94s)]
*  There's clear evidence that that's the case, yeah. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6322.34s)]
*  I mean, we talked about it with Graham Hancock [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6324.94s)]
*  the other day on the podcast [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6326.66s)]
*  and he was talking about the Blue Lotus. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6327.9s)]
*  The Blue Lotus is documented that the ancient Egyptians [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6329.94s)]
*  use this particular psychedelic. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6334.78s)]
*  There's much evidence that the ancient Greeks, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6337.78s)]
*  in fact, Brian Murorescu, who's been on the podcast before, [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6342.219999999999s)]
*  wrote a book called The Immortality Key. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6345.9s)]
*  It's a great book about how these ancient societies [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6347.82s)]
*  and the elucidated mysteries, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6352.42s)]
*  they drank wine that was laced with psychedelics. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6355.0199999999995s)]
*  And this has all been proven now [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6359.259999999999s)]
*  because they found the vessels of these wines [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6361.0199999999995s)]
*  and they tested positive for ergot. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6363.98s)]
*  And so they didn't just, when we think of wine, [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6366.58s)]
*  we think of just alcohol, but no, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6369.459999999999s)]
*  this wine actually had psychedelics mixed in. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6371.94s)]
*  And if you think about it, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6375.219999999999s)]
*  from that Enlightenment period, [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6376.94s)]
*  this is the birth of democracy. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6380.66s)]
*  This is the birth of modern civilization as we know it. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6383.06s)]
*  It came from these wise people getting together [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6386.34s)]
*  and having these rituals. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6390.26s)]
*  And that this has now opened up a field of study at Harvard [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6392.26s)]
*  because of his book and because of the success of the book [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6395.900000000001s)]
*  and his discussions of it. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6398.820000000001s)]
*  It's really amazing stuff, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6400.740000000001s)]
*  but it points to that people throughout human history [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6402.900000000001s)]
*  in order to gain great insight and wisdom [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6406.3s)]
*  have turned to these, what they call plant medicines. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6409.82s)]
*  In my Greek books, of course you read about [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6414.58s)]
*  and research the hallucinian mysteries. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6417.78s)]
*  And it's so, I mean, maybe you know more about, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6420.0199999999995s)]
*  I think they were so secret [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6423.299999999999s)]
*  that it's not like there's any book that you can read. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6426.42s)]
*  That what they did, who knows what they did. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6429.82s)]
*  Well, because it was all squashed by the Romans. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6431.98s)]
*  They squashed all that and they wound up moving [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6435.38s)]
*  to other countries in Europe. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6438.58s)]
*  There's great evidence that they moved out of Greece. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6440.0199999999995s)]
*  They moved into Spain and that they had these rituals [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6442.1s)]
*  in other countries as well. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6445.62s)]
*  And so they found these similar type of reliefs [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6447.22s)]
*  and similar pottery and inside the vessels, [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6451.34s)]
*  they've also found this ergod and wine [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6454.54s)]
*  and various psychedelics that were, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6457.82s)]
*  there's trace residue of them. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6460.3s)]
*  So these- [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6462.14s)]
*  Have you studied the hermetics at all? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6462.98s)]
*  No. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6464.18s)]
*  Ah, are you interested in it? [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6465.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6466.42s)]
*  You've studied them at all? [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6467.3s)]
*  Sure. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6468.1s)]
*  This thing? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6468.9400000000005s)]
*  Please. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6469.76s)]
*  Have you heard of a book called The Kabbalion? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6470.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6473.06s)]
*  Well, this should be right up your street. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6473.900000000001s)]
*  The hermetics were Egyptians. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6475.42s)]
*  It's where the Freemasons came from [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6478.34s)]
*  and the alchemists and the people in the Middle Ages [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6480.74s)]
*  who preserved the culture when the Dark Ages came. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6483.66s)]
*  And the hermetics comes from Hermes Trismegistus, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6488.7s)]
*  Hermes Thrace Great, who was supposedly the wisest man [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6494.22s)]
*  or avatar or god from the Egyptian period. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6498.86s)]
*  And the Kabbalion was their book. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6502.98s)]
*  I don't know if the actual Kabbalion still exists. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6506.139999999999s)]
*  There are sort of, I have like one little short book of it, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6509.26s)]
*  but they had a whole deep philosophy [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6512.7s)]
*  that is a lot like this. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6516.42s)]
*  You want me to talk about this for a second? [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6518.54s)]
*  Sure, yeah, please. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6519.94s)]
*  I mean, they were like, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6520.94s)]
*  the hermetics had like seven principles. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6523.0199999999995s)]
*  Let's see if I can remember what they are. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6524.94s)]
*  The first one is that you and I [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6527.26s)]
*  have no physical existence as entities. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6531.86s)]
*  We exist entirely as thoughts in the mind of the all or God. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6537.54s)]
*  Sort of like the analogy they use is like [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6543.06s)]
*  in the mind of Dickens is Mr. McCauber and Pip [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6545.26s)]
*  and David Copperfield and all that. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6548.66s)]
*  And that you and I only exist as thoughts [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6551.0199999999995s)]
*  in the mind of God. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6553.34s)]
*  And oh, they believe that the universe was entirely mental. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6554.74s)]
*  That's what this was. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6557.98s)]
*  That there really is no physical existence. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6559.259999999999s)]
*  And that it was all vibrational. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6561.86s)]
*  And that one of the things they believed was that [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6565.0199999999995s)]
*  there's no such thing as opposites. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6568.219999999999s)]
*  Heat and cold are not opposites. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6570.099999999999s)]
*  Fear and courage are not opposites. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6572.139999999999s)]
*  They are just points on a continuum. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6574.219999999999s)]
*  And that the difference between fear and courage [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6576.78s)]
*  is entirely in the vibration. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6579.46s)]
*  And so this is where the alchemy came in. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6581.82s)]
*  They believed that if they could change their vibration [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6584.78s)]
*  or change the vibration of lead, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6587.7s)]
*  that they could change it into gold. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6589.82s)]
*  And they had, there are other things. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6592.06s)]
*  Everything vibrates. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6594.9400000000005s)]
*  The other thing was that everything swings on a pendulum. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6596.9s)]
*  Everything goes back and forth from one thing to another. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6600.34s)]
*  And they also believe that everything is male and female. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6603.74s)]
*  That everything is created comes from the union [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6606.66s)]
*  of male and female in the highest levels. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6609.46s)]
*  Anyway, it's great shit. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6612.099999999999s)]
*  And at one point, apparently, in ancient Egypt [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6613.86s)]
*  or before that, this was what they believed. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6619.14s)]
*  And it somehow got wiped out or just held on [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6624.42s)]
*  in various little pockets of the occult knowledge [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6628.9s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6631.82s)]
*  So it's the ancient hermetics, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6632.66s)]
*  and the book is the Kabbalion, K-Y-B-A-L-I-O-N. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6635.18s)]
*  Fascinating shit. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6640.54s)]
*  I think there are many cultures [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6641.9800000000005s)]
*  that were tapping into this at some point in time. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6643.46s)]
*  Even Joe Dispenza that I was talking about before, [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6646.900000000001s)]
*  what he talks about is when you get to that state [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6649.820000000001s)]
*  of no mind, no thing, no presence, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6652.26s)]
*  that the only thing that exists [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6656.22s)]
*  is vibration and consciousness. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6658.46s)]
*  And that would be straight out of hermetic philosophy. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6661.38s)]
*  Yeah, those reoccurring themes, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6667.5s)]
*  they exist in so many cultures. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6669.74s)]
*  And one of the things that Graham Hancock brings up [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6672.1s)]
*  that's really fascinating is that as we develop [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6675.46s)]
*  more of an understanding of human evolution, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6678.74s)]
*  we realize that anatomically similar humans, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6683.1s)]
*  we go far back, back far further than we originally thought. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6687.5s)]
*  With the original assessment was that, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6691.9s)]
*  like we, I think remember when I was in high school, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6693.82s)]
*  they thought it was like 50,000 years ago. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6696.42s)]
*  Like that anatomical human sort of emerged 50,000 years ago, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6698.46s)]
*  and then human civilization emerged like 6,000 years ago. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6701.42s)]
*  And now they're finding all this evidence [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6704.46s)]
*  of advanced civilization, like Gobekli Tepe, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6707.06s)]
*  which is this uncovered site in Turkey, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6709.7s)]
*  this massive structure that existed [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6712.62s)]
*  11,000 something years ago. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6715.18s)]
*  And this was the first ever thing that they could date [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6717.62s)]
*  that they know for sure is older than the pyramids [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6722.14s)]
*  by quite a bit, at least older than [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6725.42s)]
*  the conventional dating of the pyramids. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6727.22s)]
*  And so there was advanced civilization [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6729.26s)]
*  that was capable of building these immense, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6731.26s)]
*  huge structures, giant pillars, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6733.3s)]
*  with these huge stone things [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6735.700000000001s)]
*  that had cut into them reliefs of animals [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6740.22s)]
*  that were three dimensional, which is very complicated [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6742.46s)]
*  because instead of carving them into the stone, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6745.22s)]
*  they carved the stone around them. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6747.5s)]
*  So they had like these lizards and these creatures [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6749.34s)]
*  that were crawling up these stones [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6752.1s)]
*  that they had moved, they cut the stone out. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6753.9s)]
*  And we're talking about like 20 foot tall, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6756.46s)]
*  massive, hundreds of ton, I mean, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6758.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know how much these things weighed. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6761.78s)]
*  Huge things, like very advanced people [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6763.82s)]
*  that were capable of construction methods. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6766.3s)]
*  And they did these concentric circles with these things, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6768.22s)]
*  they don't know why they did it, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6772.0599999999995s)]
*  they don't know what they were doing with them. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6773.179999999999s)]
*  But that if human anatomically similar humans [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6775.219999999999s)]
*  existed half a million years ago, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6779.74s)]
*  that gives them so much time to evolve and become that. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6782.38s)]
*  And this catastrophe theory sort of makes sense [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6785.98s)]
*  because there was probably some really advanced thinking [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6790.139999999999s)]
*  and really advanced science that we don't totally understand [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6794.74s)]
*  because our science has gone in this sort of [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6797.62s)]
*  industrial age technological direction, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6801.06s)]
*  whereas their science probably went [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6804.660000000001s)]
*  in a completely different direction, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6806.780000000001s)]
*  concentrating on vibrations of things and sound [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6808.02s)]
*  and probably some lost technology [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6811.900000000001s)]
*  that we don't understand yet, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6814.700000000001s)]
*  but we may in the future. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6816.18s)]
*  And that'll probably put the pieces together, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6818.06s)]
*  but it's taken us thousands and thousands of years [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6820.5s)]
*  to relearn things that perhaps these people [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6823.18s)]
*  that lived 10,000, 20,000 years ago [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6826.18s)]
*  had already figured out. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6828.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you think about somebody like LeBron James, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6830.7s)]
*  somebody that is at a level, an amazing level, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6834.339999999999s)]
*  what if there were guys like this that were thinkers [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6837.0599999999995s)]
*  and philosophers or meditators or whatever they were, [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6839.7s)]
*  and they were at that level of being able to tap into [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6842.66s)]
*  whatever it is, vibration, we don't know anything about it. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6845.66s)]
*  The elite of the elite of thinkers. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6848.98s)]
*  What could they do? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6850.78s)]
*  I mean, it always seemed to me crazy that [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6852.82s)]
*  the human race only goes back 150,000 years or 300,000. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6854.86s)]
*  Can't be right, can't be right that there was, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6858.54s)]
*  you know, just only the great apes and all of a sudden, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6860.86s)]
*  300,000 years ago or 150,000 years ago. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6864.66s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6867.74s)]
*  Well, there was a recent discovery, [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6868.66s)]
*  I'll send this to Jamie, they found evidence [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6870.1s)]
*  that human beings were cooking fish 700,000 plus years ago. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6873.22s)]
*  Ah, that makes a lot of sense. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6879.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, here I'll send this to Jamie. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6881.94s)]
*  It's really wild because- [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6884.7s)]
*  And it was trout amandine. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6886.94s)]
*  That's the amazing shit. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6888.82s)]
*  No, it was Chilean sea bass. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6890.419999999999s)]
*  No, that's not really a sea bass. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6892.74s)]
*  780,000 years ago, that's the evidence. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6895.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's fascinating stuff. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6901.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6903.179999999999s)]
*  The other thing is how much of those ancient civilizations [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6904.0199999999995s)]
*  were about- [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6906.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you found it, Jamie found it. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6906.9s)]
*  Early humans may have cooked fish in ovens 780,000 years ago. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6908.099999999999s)]
*  Remains of fish teeth. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6914.139999999999s)]
*  That cheers me up. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6916.5s)]
*  Remains of fish teeth at an archeological site in Israel [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6918.0199999999995s)]
*  appear to have been cooked with controlled heat [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6921.099999999999s)]
*  rather than directly exposed to fire. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6923.82s)]
*  So that's very advanced in our sense of like [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6926.0199999999995s)]
*  what people were capable of doing 780,000 years ago. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6928.74s)]
*  We've developed a methodology that allows us [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6934.099999999999s)]
*  to identify cooking in relatively low temperatures [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6936.139999999999s)]
*  as opposed to burning. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6938.98s)]
*  She says, you cannot immediately correlate [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6940.46s)]
*  the control of fire with cooking [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6943.18s)]
*  unless you show that the food has been cooked. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6944.700000000001s)]
*  Wow, researchers have previously suggested [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6948.42s)]
*  that humans were cooking meat 1.5 million years ago [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6951.14s)]
*  based on the discovery of charred animal remains, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6955.02s)]
*  but that doesn't necessarily mean people were heating food [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6957.740000000001s)]
*  before eating it, says Zohar. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6960.54s)]
*  Evidence of charred material doesn't mean cooking, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6962.780000000001s)]
*  it just means the food was thrown into the fire. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6965.34s)]
*  Zohar and her colleagues have studied [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6968.26s)]
*  a 780,000 year old settlement in Gesher Benot Yal, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6970.06s)]
*  how do you say that? [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6976.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6976.9400000000005s)]
*  Try that. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6977.780000000001s)]
*  Yal Akhwav, in Israel's northern Jordan River Valley, [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6978.620000000001s)]
*  no human remains have been found there [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6982.18s)]
*  but based on its age and the stone tools at the site, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6984.06s)]
*  the inhabitants are most likely to have been Homo erectus. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6987.02s)]
*  Wow, amazing, amazing stuff. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6990.860000000001s)]
*  So, you know, if you think of those early humans [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6994.3s)]
*  and like when did they become anatomically modern humans? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=6998.34s)]
*  Was it half a million years ago? [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7001.58s)]
*  Whatever it was, it gives us a lot of room [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7002.9800000000005s)]
*  to learn things and figure things out [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7005.5s)]
*  before, you know, natural catastrophes [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7007.54s)]
*  wiped civilization back to the Stone Age again. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7010.38s)]
*  Yeah, the other thing I was just saying was that [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7013.1s)]
*  if you think about these, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7015.06s)]
*  what we know about these civilizations is there was stone [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7015.9800000000005s)]
*  seems to have a lot to do with this shit, right? [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7019.54s)]
*  Whether it's South America, you know, Mesoamerica, whatever, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7022.62s)]
*  it's stone pyramids and stone this and stone that [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7025.46s)]
*  supposedly is a vibrational material, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7029.1s)]
*  like something that could be the equivalent of a battery [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7031.9400000000005s)]
*  that could hold, you know, at least I've heard that, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7035.820000000001s)]
*  you know, we're talking about, you know, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7037.9400000000005s)]
*  imaginative stuff here, but who knows what they knew about, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7039.5s)]
*  you know, protecting. It gets very woo woo without ever. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7045.46s)]
*  It does, but you know, every time something is disproved [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7047.7s)]
*  like when they said, oh, Homer's description of Troy [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7052.34s)]
*  and in the Iliad, it was a bunch of bullshit, right? [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7057.46s)]
*  It couldn't have been that big, right? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7059.7s)]
*  And then Schliemann digs up the remains of Troy [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7061.18s)]
*  and it's exactly like Homer said, right? [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7064.74s)]
*  The gate is right here, the other gate is here. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7067.5s)]
*  So every time we think, oh, these previous generations [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7070.18s)]
*  couldn't have known that. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7074.74s)]
*  And then we finally dig it up and go, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7075.7s)]
*  they were way beyond what we thought they were doing. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7077.22s)]
*  The discovery of Troy was very eye-opening [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7079.900000000001s)]
*  because now you have to take into account, [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7082.22s)]
*  well, what about Atlantis? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7083.42s)]
*  When you talked about Atlantis, was that real too? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7085.02s)]
*  Was there really an advance? [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7086.82s)]
*  We're getting out there too. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7088.34s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7089.34s)]
*  Why are we going to this place? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7091.179999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7092.46s)]
*  Well, I mean, human beings are constantly innovating [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7093.78s)]
*  and constantly improving. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7097.38s)]
*  And if there was a time in history [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7098.94s)]
*  where we had achieved some immense level of, [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7101.259999999999s)]
*  through some method that we don't understand, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7106.299999999999s)]
*  of advanced civilization, and then, you know, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7108.46s)]
*  it all got wiped out and this is the new manifestation [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7112.0199999999995s)]
*  of human creativity and ingenuity and innovation [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7115.1s)]
*  has become this thing that we see now. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7117.9800000000005s)]
*  But we think this is the only way, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7120.22s)]
*  oh, this is as good as people have ever been. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7121.9800000000005s)]
*  But we're just ignorant to the past. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7124.22s)]
*  Very possible. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7126.54s)]
*  And interesting. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7128.3s)]
*  Very, very, very interesting. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7129.38s)]
*  Like that show that Graham Hancock has made, [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7131.38s)]
*  I believe it's the number two show on Netflix now, [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7133.660000000001s)]
*  which is giant. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7137.06s)]
*  I mean, that's pretty crazy that an educational show [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7138.660000000001s)]
*  about an ancient catastrophe [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7143.38s)]
*  has become the number two show on Netflix. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7145.1s)]
*  And it makes you wonder why do contemporary audiences [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7147.18s)]
*  respond to that so much, you know? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7150.58s)]
*  I think it resonates with us. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7152.46s)]
*  I think it makes sense, you know? [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7153.66s)]
*  Yeah, we hear it and we go, there's something to this. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7155.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7157.62s)]
*  Or at least there could be. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7158.46s)]
*  He describes us as a species with amnesia. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7159.58s)]
*  Ah. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7162.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7163.54s)]
*  I think- [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7164.38s)]
*  Sometimes it feels like that, doesn't it? [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7165.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7166.66s)]
*  I mean, I'm a believer in previous lives [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7167.5s)]
*  while we're getting far out here. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7169.9800000000005s)]
*  So I sort of sometimes think that that amnesia [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7171.62s)]
*  is from lives that we've lived, you know? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7174.18s)]
*  Maybe it's that too. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7177.22s)]
*  Maybe it's history and from lives that we live. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7178.42s)]
*  Maybe they're all combined [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7180.46s)]
*  in some sort of a strange and unknown way. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7182.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7184.34s)]
*  Now, when you say you're a believer in unknown lives, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7185.18s)]
*  what specifically do you mean? [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7187.74s)]
*  I mean, past lives rather. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7190.98s)]
*  I just sort of feel like, you know, if you look at, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7194.099999999999s)]
*  let's say you have three kids in your family. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7198.3s)]
*  Each one comes out of the womb as a fully formed personality. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7202.02s)]
*  Wouldn't you agree with that? [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7205.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7206.62s)]
*  It's not like you can mold them into whatever it is, right? [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7207.46s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7211.14s)]
*  They already are something. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7211.9800000000005s)]
*  And you also feel, and I feel this about myself, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7213.58s)]
*  like they come into the world with their own issues, right? [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7216.38s)]
*  There's something, you know, one of them may be angry. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7221.14s)]
*  One of them may be very peaceful, you know? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7223.860000000001s)]
*  But so where does that come from? [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7226.62s)]
*  Where does it come from? [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7228.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, it would just pop out of nowhere. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7229.82s)]
*  I mean, so, I mean, I love this shit [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7231.700000000001s)]
*  just because it's stories, you know? [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7235.02s)]
*  I love to make up stories, right? [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7236.740000000001s)]
*  But like in my book, The Legend of Bagger Vance, [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7239.02s)]
*  it really was about previous lives, you know? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7242.26s)]
*  It was about, it went back to the continent of moo [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7244.540000000001s)]
*  and all that sort of stuff. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7248.14s)]
*  And as I'm writing this and it's coming out of me, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7249.580000000001s)]
*  I don't even know I believe it until I see it on the page. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7252.620000000001s)]
*  So it does, by the time I was still writing that, [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7255.860000000001s)]
*  I sort of felt like, you know, I believe in this. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7258.42s)]
*  I think there's something to it. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7261.7s)]
*  And I also believe, for whatever this is worth, [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7262.54s)]
*  that we don't go through previous lives [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7266.54s)]
*  just as solitary individuals. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7268.58s)]
*  I believe that we might have like a group of four [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7270.7s)]
*  or five souls that are kind of migrating with us [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7272.74s)]
*  through these lives, you know, and have this, you know, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7276.66s)]
*  like a constellation of souls that have a same, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7279.42s)]
*  we might have a mentor that's with us, you know, [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7282.82s)]
*  through various lives. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7285.38s)]
*  Again, I can't prove this in any way, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7286.62s)]
*  but I sort of have that feeling, you know? [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7288.98s)]
*  Where does that feeling come from? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7293.7s)]
*  When you say you have that feeling, [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7294.98s)]
*  how does that feeling manifest itself in your mind? [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7296.179999999999s)]
*  I find myself writing it, right? [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7299.419999999999s)]
*  And I don't know where it's coming from. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7302.139999999999s)]
*  And as I'm writing it, I feel like that makes sense to me. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7304.219999999999s)]
*  This doesn't sound like bullshit to me. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7307.98s)]
*  This sounds like, you know, reality. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7310.179999999999s)]
*  And so again, I can't base this on anything [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7313.299999999999s)]
*  other than I'm sort of inspired with it from somewhere. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7317.54s)]
*  You're just saying it resonates. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7321.34s)]
*  It resonates with me. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7322.42s)]
*  It rings true to me. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7323.66s)]
*  What do you think the soul is? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7324.74s)]
*  Boy, that's a great question. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7327.14s)]
*  I mean, it's that, it's that, it certainly exists, right? [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7328.7s)]
*  There is such a thing as a soul, [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7333.42s)]
*  even though we can't weigh it, right? [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7335.22s)]
*  We can't find it, we can't put it under a microscope, [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7336.7s)]
*  but there's certainly something there [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7339.66s)]
*  other than the ego, right? [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7342.06s)]
*  And everything I've been talking about today [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7343.98s)]
*  about that underground river and the greater dimension, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7346.42s)]
*  that's to me is soul. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7349.18s)]
*  And if we live by soul, we're gonna be happy [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7351.42s)]
*  and we're gonna be productive. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7356.58s)]
*  And if we dismiss soul, we're fucked, you know? [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7357.9s)]
*  If we stay in that ego, we're fucked. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7361.42s)]
*  And you know, I think what you were talking about earlier, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7363.62s)]
*  Joe, about you don't wanna get in that place [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7367.18s)]
*  of I'm listening to praise or blame or anything like that. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7369.86s)]
*  That's our instinct. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7375.58s)]
*  The soul, I think, doesn't have anything to do with that, [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7377.22s)]
*  doesn't give a shit about that, right? [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7379.34s)]
*  Just as operating, you know, [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7381.42s)]
*  it's got its own North Star that it's going toward, you know? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7382.9s)]
*  That's what it seems like to me. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7387.5s)]
*  And it seems like it's much wiser than we are. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7389.38s)]
*  I mean, I think when we tap into that, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7393.54s)]
*  we tap into like 0.0001, [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7395.66s)]
*  and it blows our mind, it's so much to it, you know? [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7399.66s)]
*  I think there's, you know, it's some greater cosmic unity, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7402.42s)]
*  I don't know what. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7408.9s)]
*  But it's real. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7410.9s)]
*  So when you write, this is like a repeating theme [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7413.14s)]
*  that resonates in your mind, [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7417.82s)]
*  that leads you to believe there's truth to this. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7420.02s)]
*  Yes, or at least it's a great story, you know? [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7422.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7425.5s)]
*  It makes a story. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7426.34s)]
*  It's certainly a great story, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7427.62s)]
*  but it also exists throughout human culture [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7429.14s)]
*  for some strange reason. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7432.9400000000005s)]
*  It's something that we've concentrated on [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7434.38s)]
*  from the beginning of time. It's part of Hinduism. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7436.26s)]
*  Great civilizations and religions [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7437.5s)]
*  that have been around for tens of thousands of years [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7440.58s)]
*  believe it absolutely. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7442.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7444.46s)]
*  It's not airy-fairy to them. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7445.3s)]
*  And do you think that they came to that conclusion [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7447.3s)]
*  from the same sort of process of when you think about it, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7451.26s)]
*  or you contemplate it and write about it, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7455.780000000001s)]
*  it seems to resonate, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7457.62s)]
*  and then when you say it to other people, [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7459.78s)]
*  they're like, yeah, there's something there. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7461.62s)]
*  I mean, if you bring in psychedelics [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7464.22s)]
*  or what you were talking about about who knows [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7465.86s)]
*  what the ancient Incas and all these cultures, [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7467.7s)]
*  whatever they used, right, to get to that state [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7471.54s)]
*  where they were seeing, you know, [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7475.62s)]
*  the global thing beyond everything, [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7477.74s)]
*  maybe they really experienced that, you know? [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7479.86s)]
*  Maybe they could travel back and relive those lives, you know? [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7485.099999999999s)]
*  You know, there's a, in the Bhagavad Gita, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7490.58s)]
*  there's one great stanza where Krishna, who's God, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7492.58s)]
*  is saying to Arjuna, the great warrior, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7496.7s)]
*  who's his protege, he says, [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7499.74s)]
*  "'You and I have had many lives, Arjuna. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7502.46s)]
*  "'I remember all of mine, but thou dost not.'" [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7505.66s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7509.42s)]
*  I mean, it's a great religion. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7511.0199999999995s)]
*  It's been around a long time. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7513.42s)]
*  They believed it. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7515.46s)]
*  I was having a conversation with someone [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7516.3s)]
*  when we were talking about this concept of, [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7517.139999999999s)]
*  imagine if you lived the same life [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7518.82s)]
*  over and over and over again until you got it right. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7521.78s)]
*  And, because some people do believe in that. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7525.18s)]
*  And this person I was talking to was like, [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7527.18s)]
*  God, that's terrifying. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7529.22s)]
*  And I go, is it though? [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7530.94s)]
*  Like, if you're living this life right now, [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7532.58s)]
*  like, and all throughout your life, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7536.3s)]
*  you've been living this life and just having fun [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7538.26s)]
*  and doing things and having fun with your friends [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7541.099999999999s)]
*  and living your life and having a family. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7543.42s)]
*  Does it, doesn't it, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7546.14s)]
*  isn't, don't you like it? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7549.42s)]
*  You like it, right? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7551.06s)]
*  If you're doing it right, you should enjoy it. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7552.02s)]
*  So, why would it bother you if that goes on forever? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7554.22s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7557.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, you want it to go on while you're alive, [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7558.9s)]
*  but the concept of it going on forever [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7561.58s)]
*  and ever and ever and ever until you get it right [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7564.18s)]
*  is terrifying to people. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7566.74s)]
*  But why? [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7568.22s)]
*  Why is it terrifying if the current existence, [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7569.46s)]
*  if you're living in the moment, your current existence, [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7574.14s)]
*  like, you don't want this to end. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7577.02s)]
*  Like, most people are scared of dying. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7578.66s)]
*  So you don't want this to stop. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7580.62s)]
*  But why are you scared of living the same life [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7582.18s)]
*  over and over and over again until you get it right [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7586.58s)]
*  if you're not scared of living this life right now? [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7588.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, I guess you're scared of the idea [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7592.38s)]
*  of sort of stasis, that it never changes, right? [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7594.9400000000005s)]
*  That you're not getting anywhere. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7598.02s)]
*  But it does change, because you get better at it. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7599.42s)]
*  The idea of, if you have an issue that you're working on, [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7600.26s)]
*  the idea that it takes a few lifetimes to do it, [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7605.42s)]
*  I don't think there's anything scary about that. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7609.38s)]
*  It's kind of a story that has a season one [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7611.5s)]
*  and a season two and a season three. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7614.22s)]
*  Yeah, but there's a terrifying connection. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7616.02s)]
*  There's a terrifying feeling [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7620.66s)]
*  when you contemplate infinite time. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7622.46s)]
*  And infinite time being Steven Pressfield. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7625.820000000001s)]
*  That's scary. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7631.1s)]
*  This is you. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7631.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, see? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7632.780000000001s)]
*  This is you forever. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7633.820000000001s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7635.3s)]
*  Why does that freak people out? [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7636.3s)]
*  But it does. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7639.26s)]
*  I got a question for you, Joe. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7640.22s)]
*  Do you believe that there's a moral dimension [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7641.42s)]
*  to the universe? [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7645.02s)]
*  A moral dimension. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7645.9800000000005s)]
*  A moral dimension. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7646.820000000001s)]
*  Is there justice somewhat? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7647.9800000000005s)]
*  Now, this goes along with previous lives, right? [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7651.06s)]
*  If you think about previous lives, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7653.62s)]
*  you think usually that there's maybe a crime. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7655.02s)]
*  You committed a crime 25 lives ago [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7658.54s)]
*  and you're sort of paying, coming to an understanding. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7662.9s)]
*  Hopefully you evolve to a point where you've reached [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7666.78s)]
*  forgiveness or whatever it is, right? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7669.62s)]
*  But that would imply that there was a moral dimension [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7672.46s)]
*  to the universe, that it couldn't, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7676.18s)]
*  actions have consequences, right? [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7678.74s)]
*  There's karma. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7680.42s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7682.1s)]
*  Or do you believe that everything is just, [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7682.98s)]
*  you do what you do and it doesn't matter? [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7686.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7689.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, when you go over human history [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7692.38s)]
*  and think of the horrible people that have succeeded [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7695.3s)]
*  and lived long lives, you think of Genghis Khan [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7699.740000000001s)]
*  and what he did. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7703.860000000001s)]
*  There didn't seem to be a lot of negative karma [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7706.14s)]
*  coming his way. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7708.38s)]
*  He seemed to have made- [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7709.660000000001s)]
*  Maybe not in that lifetime. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7710.5s)]
*  Maybe, right? [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7711.62s)]
*  Maybe in the next life he suffers. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7712.58s)]
*  Maybe he lives his life over and over again [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7714.26s)]
*  until he becomes a monk. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7716.9400000000005s)]
*  The ancient Greeks, they certainly believed [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7718.38s)]
*  that there were the fates, you know? [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7720.46s)]
*  And that there were these gods and goddesses [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7723.3s)]
*  that were enacting justice, you know? [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7725.62s)]
*  One way or another. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7730.3s)]
*  So I'd like to think that's true. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7732.1s)]
*  But that gives us a feeling of order. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7735.26s)]
*  There's rules to things. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7737.780000000001s)]
*  But are we just making it up or is it real? [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7739.18s)]
*  I mean, what do you think? [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7741.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7743.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7744.7s)]
*  I definitely feel like from an individual's perspective, [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7746.22s)]
*  if you do something, like say if you steal money [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7752.66s)]
*  from someone you know, if you're not a sociopath, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7755.94s)]
*  you're going to feel guilt from that. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7760.5s)]
*  It's gonna haunt you if you lie [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7762.54s)]
*  and you're constantly repeating that lie [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7765.22s)]
*  and trying to get people to be convinced of that lie. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7767.9s)]
*  That is gonna haunt you. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7771.22s)]
*  And I think it's going to rob you of the present. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7774.22s)]
*  It's gonna rob you of being in the moment. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7776.860000000001s)]
*  You're always going to be burdened down [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7779.02s)]
*  by this feeling that you have that you are a fraud [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7781.14s)]
*  or you are a thief or you're a bad person. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7786.74s)]
*  You have done bad things. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7790.54s)]
*  But you stealing that person's money, [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7792.34s)]
*  you've ruined the fact that they've worked really hard [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7793.9800000000005s)]
*  and saved it and you just came along and snatched it. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7797.900000000001s)]
*  So you've done this horrible selfish thing [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7800.22s)]
*  and maybe you feel justified [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7803.62s)]
*  because the world has fucked you over. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7805.38s)]
*  And so you feel like it's okay to break the window [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7808.02s)]
*  of that store and jump in there and loot [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7811.14s)]
*  and take everything that you feel like, [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7813.58s)]
*  I want that, why don't I get that? [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7815.3s)]
*  And everyone else is gonna do it, let's go, let's go do it. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7817.38s)]
*  But I think in doing that, [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7820.02s)]
*  you can't appreciate yourself as like an accomplice [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7822.22s)]
*  product, you're not a finished thing. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7830.820000000001s)]
*  You're not what you wish you were. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7837.780000000001s)]
*  You're not admirable. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7840.26s)]
*  You're not anything that people would look at and go, [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7842.02s)]
*  wow, I wish I was that guy. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7844.66s)]
*  Nobody's like, wow, I wish I was that thief, [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7846.42s)]
*  wish I was that liar. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7849.02s)]
*  Nobody thinks like that. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7850.780000000001s)]
*  They wanna be someone who other people admire. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7852.26s)]
*  Now I wonder, is that because we were taught that [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7856.38s)]
*  by our parents or by our schools? [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7860.26s)]
*  Or is that natural? [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7862.900000000001s)]
*  Do we naturally feel if we hurt some other kid that, [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7865.18s)]
*  oh, I did something wrong? [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7870.34s)]
*  I wonder, I don't know. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7873.5s)]
*  I think it goes back to this thing [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7874.86s)]
*  that we are all connected [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7876.78s)]
*  and that in doing something hurtful or evil to someone, [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7878.38s)]
*  you are causing pain. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7882.74s)]
*  Again, unless you're a sociopath, that pain you feel. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7885.9400000000005s)]
*  You feel that pain. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7890.22s)]
*  You get this lesson out of that. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7892.860000000001s)]
*  You're supposed to get that as your child. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7895.38s)]
*  You say something mean to someone and then they feel bad, [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7897.3s)]
*  then you feel bad. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7900.22s)]
*  Why would I say that? [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7901.06s)]
*  Then you learn, don't do that [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7902.3s)]
*  because you're spreading negativity. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7904.7s)]
*  You're pushing out this emotional poison on people [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7906.74s)]
*  and it does affect the quality of your own life [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7910.1s)]
*  because we are connected. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7913.18s)]
*  That's the evidence that we're connected. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7914.62s)]
*  But I don't know. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7916.98s)]
*  I can't say I believe anything. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7920.9s)]
*  I say there's clear evidence to be in my life [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7924.54s)]
*  that when I'm kinder and nicer and more friendly [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7928.9s)]
*  and doing things in a better way, [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7932.9s)]
*  that things work out better. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7934.62s)]
*  It seems like my interactions with people are better. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7936.099999999999s)]
*  I feel better. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7939.18s)]
*  I feel better about myself [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7940.66s)]
*  and I feel genuinely like I'm on the right path. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7942.0199999999995s)]
*  When I'm more disciplined, when I get work done, [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7945.459999999999s)]
*  when I show up and respect the muse, I feel better. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7948.62s)]
*  So I feel like my life resonates correctly with me. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7952.82s)]
*  I feel like I'm, like the universe is saying, [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7958.5s)]
*  exactly, that's how you're supposed to do it. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7961.58s)]
*  That's what you do. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7963.459999999999s)]
*  You do the right thing, eat the right foods, [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7964.94s)]
*  get your sleep, live healthy, be nice, put in the work, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7967.299999999999s)]
*  overcome resistance, get your creativity going. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7972.82s)]
*  You feel better in living like that. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7976.82s)]
*  I think there's probably something to that [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7979.9s)]
*  that people throughout history have gravitated [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7982.0199999999995s)]
*  towards these sort of inherent life lessons [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7985.299999999999s)]
*  that exist in moving through this world [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7989.179999999999s)]
*  the right way, the correct way. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7994.179999999999s)]
*  And that's probably why all of these religions [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=7996.259999999999s)]
*  have a moral structure. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8000.42s)]
*  They have an ethical structure in there teaching you [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8002.5s)]
*  how to live your life with the least amount of harm [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8005.9s)]
*  to others and the most amount of service to God [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8008.62s)]
*  and service to the people around you. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8011.58s)]
*  Now what I wonder sort of is, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8013.54s)]
*  are those religions that teach that, [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8016.18s)]
*  which is every religion, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8018.14s)]
*  inculcating that into kids and into everybody as they grow [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8022.7s)]
*  because the human being by nature is savage [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8026.62s)]
*  and evil and selfish. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8031.7s)]
*  And so this, it needs to be indoctrinated [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8034.26s)]
*  or conditioned or raised or socialized. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8039.46s)]
*  Just a question, I don't know the answer. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8042.5s)]
*  Because I certainly, as a teller of stories, [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8045.58s)]
*  or movies, books, whatever, books and movies [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8049.66s)]
*  all have a moral dimension, right? [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8053.42s)]
*  There's always something, there's payback [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8055.46s)]
*  or if there isn't payback, when you walk, [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8057.74s)]
*  if the good guy, if the bad guy prevails in the end, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8060.22s)]
*  you walk out and you go, oh boy, that's, you know. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8063.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8066.26s)]
*  They're just trying to. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8067.1s)]
*  It's not satisfying. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8067.94s)]
*  You know, so, but then the question sort of is, [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8068.78s)]
*  are the artists who are writing these things, [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8073.46s)]
*  is it to, because they know that human beings [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8076.02s)]
*  are basically rotten and don't have that moral dimension. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8079.7s)]
*  I don't know the answer. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8084.58s)]
*  It's a really good question. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8085.42s)]
*  I think human beings are most certainly capable [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8086.46s)]
*  of being rotten and human beings are most certainly capable [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8089.74s)]
*  of being great and being kind and being generous. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8094.38s)]
*  And we're aware of both of those things. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8098.5s)]
*  And one, we admire. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8100.74s)]
*  We admire the Martin Luther King Juniors of the world. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8102.7s)]
*  We admire the philosophers and the poets [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8105.98s)]
*  and the musicians that inspire us [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8109.9s)]
*  and the people that live their lives [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8112.0199999999995s)]
*  in a moral and ethical way. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8113.26s)]
*  Those are the people that we admire. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8114.820000000001s)]
*  Those are the people that we aspire to be like. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8117.02s)]
*  No one's aspiring to be like Hitler. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8120.66s)]
*  You know, like the people that live their life [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8122.860000000001s)]
*  in a horrible way. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8124.900000000001s)]
*  Few guys. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8125.74s)]
*  Well, they're probably fucked up too. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8126.58s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying, like it's not like, [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8128.14s)]
*  it's not attractive to a healthy person. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8130.820000000001s)]
*  A healthy person is attracted to the person [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8134.14s)]
*  who is succeeding and who is, they're improving [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8136.46s)]
*  and they're representing an admirable life [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8142.3s)]
*  that you can aspire to try to live in a similar manner. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8145.9s)]
*  That's what resonates with most healthy people. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8150.9s)]
*  But then also there's people that grow up [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8155.06s)]
*  in entirely unhealthy ways. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8156.82s)]
*  If you're living in some sort of a war torn, [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8158.62s)]
*  terrifying country that's run by dictators [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8161.34s)]
*  and all you've ever seen is violence, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8164.14s)]
*  it's probably very, very, very difficult [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8166.5s)]
*  to develop this sort of moral structure [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8168.78s)]
*  and ethical structure. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8170.98s)]
*  I guess the story of Job in the Bible is that, right? [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8172.179999999999s)]
*  Where the bet is, you know, if we break this guy's, [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8175.62s)]
*  Job's balls badly enough, you know, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8178.5s)]
*  he will turn against you, God, and he will curse you. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8181.86s)]
*  Let's put him to the test, right? [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8184.759999999999s)]
*  So I don't know, it's an issue that we don't know what the, [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8187.78s)]
*  but it does connect to the idea of previous lives. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8191.139999999999s)]
*  Are we working something out over various lifetimes [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8193.78s)]
*  to try to come to some understanding? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8199.86s)]
*  Or is there only this one life? [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8201.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8204.1s)]
*  I don't know, but just the fact that we have this one life, [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8204.94s)]
*  just the fact that this one, life itself is so bizarre, [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8208.7s)]
*  so bizarre and so, [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8213.58s)]
*  I always say that if life wasn't real, [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8217.7s)]
*  if life was a psychedelic trip, [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8222.06s)]
*  it would be the wildest psychedelic trip ever. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8224.5s)]
*  It would be so bizarrely strange. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8227.14s)]
*  If we didn't exist in a physical material world [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8229.22s)]
*  and there was a drug that you could take [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8233.5s)]
*  that allowed you to exist in a physical material world [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8235.74s)]
*  and interact with modern society, [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8239.5s)]
*  it would be such a trip. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8241.74s)]
*  Oh my God, this is so difficult to navigate. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8243.619999999999s)]
*  What a bad trip I'm having. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8246.439999999999s)]
*  But we do exist, at least as far as we're aware, we do. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8249.26s)]
*  So the idea that this is the only life you get, [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8257.34s)]
*  like says who? [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8262.74s)]
*  Like this is weird enough as it is. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8263.9s)]
*  Like why is it so extra weird if you've lived a thousand lives [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8265.86s)]
*  and that every time you're born, [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8270.5s)]
*  you are picking up where you left off? [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8272.66s)]
*  Or you are born into a new situation [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8275.740000000002s)]
*  where you are now going to be the victim [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8280.62s)]
*  of all the injustices that you caused in the world [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8284.380000000001s)]
*  and then you'll have a chance in the life after that [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8288.26s)]
*  to live a more righteous life. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8291.7s)]
*  But you're gonna have to now go through this [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8293.1s)]
*  and try to find peace in the lessons [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8296.04s)]
*  that like say if you're a banker [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8298.58s)]
*  and you stole everybody's money, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8299.66s)]
*  you're gonna come back as a person [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8300.900000000001s)]
*  who gets fucked over by the government. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8302.42s)]
*  It's fucked over by banks [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8304.3s)]
*  and you're gonna experience this immense frustration. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8305.66s)]
*  I mean there's a lot of people that believe that, [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8308.5s)]
*  that people that are living terrible lives right now [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8311.06s)]
*  that just get awful rolls of the dice and their life sucks [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8313.38s)]
*  is because of what you've done in past lives. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8316.06s)]
*  And the people that are extremely fortunate [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8318.58s)]
*  is because of the positive seeds [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8320.38s)]
*  that you sowed in your past life. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8322.5s)]
*  Which is very convenient. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8325.34s)]
*  I don't know if I believe that, [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8326.179999999998s)]
*  but it's interesting too. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8327.019999999999s)]
*  I don't know what I believe. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8328.46s)]
*  I mean it's fun to talk about, [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8330.58s)]
*  but it's just so much of it is just like, [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8332.78s)]
*  who the fuck? [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8334.78s)]
*  Maybe it'll all come clear at some point. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8337.86s)]
*  Hopefully. I don't know. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8340.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know either. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8341.900000000001s)]
*  But I do know like what makes you feel good, right? [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8343.54s)]
*  What makes you feel good is community, love, friendship, [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8346.62s)]
*  and then the satisfaction of work, [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8350.66s)]
*  the satisfaction of overcoming what you call resistance, [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8354.44s)]
*  of having discipline in your life. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8357.94s)]
*  My friend Jaco, he has this quote, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8360.400000000001s)]
*  discipline equals freedom. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8363.04s)]
*  Yes. It's a great quote. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8365.0s)]
*  It's his book. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8366.12s)]
*  Well, it's true. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8366.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it is true. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8367.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8368.640000000001s)]
*  And that's a whole other sort of mystery is why did God [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8369.480000000001s)]
*  or whoever designed the universe make it such that [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8372.44s)]
*  in order for you to feel good about yourself and whatever, [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8376.0s)]
*  you have to do something that's hard. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8379.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8381.32s)]
*  And if you do something that's easy, [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8382.16s)]
*  if you eat sugar, if you do whatever it is, [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8383.6s)]
*  you're not gonna feel good. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8386.36s)]
*  Why does it work that way? [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8387.560000000001s)]
*  But it's true. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8389.64s)]
*  It does. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8390.48s)]
*  That's an absolute rule. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8391.3s)]
*  It certainly does physically with humans. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8392.68s)]
*  You know, the people that I know [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8395.66s)]
*  that are the most miserable are obese, sedentary, [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8397.039999999999s)]
*  indulgent, and they are emotional messes. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8400.74s)]
*  They're just a wreck of angst and anxiety, [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8405.0s)]
*  and they're filled with medications, [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8408.96s)]
*  and they're constantly going to the doctor for a new thing. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8411.16s)]
*  And they haven't made that connection. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8415.199999999999s)]
*  They just live this awful anxiety-ridden life, [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8418.04s)]
*  and they think that this is life, [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8421.4s)]
*  because that's their baseline. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8422.72s)]
*  They don't know what it's like to live a life [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8424.2s)]
*  that's free of that. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8426.2s)]
*  And even those who have overcome that, [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8428.16s)]
*  that temptation is always there. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8433.34s)]
*  Always there. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8435.16s)]
*  That cliff is always there. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8436.0s)]
*  It's like an alcoholic, one drink and it's over, you know? [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8437.04s)]
*  And not even for people that have, [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8440.2s)]
*  just people that have overcome that, [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8442.36s)]
*  but for people like myself [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8444.92s)]
*  that have never fallen prey to it. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8446.36s)]
*  Like I've never had a sedentary life, [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8448.84s)]
*  but still to me, like every time I go to the gym, [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8451.08s)]
*  I'm like, oh boy, here we go. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8454.400000000001s)]
*  Like I know now that I just have to do it. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8456.800000000001s)]
*  And I just, it doesn't matter how I feel, [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8460.34s)]
*  I'm going to do the work. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8463.12s)]
*  And because I've just established that. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8464.76s)]
*  When I get there, as soon as I get there, [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8466.900000000001s)]
*  it's go time, let's go. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8469.84s)]
*  And then once I get moving, [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8471.640000000001s)]
*  and once I'm three sets in and four sets in [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8474.24s)]
*  and I'm covered in sweat, now we're fine. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8477.24s)]
*  Now we know what to do. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8479.68s)]
*  And now I embrace the exertion and all is good. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8480.64s)]
*  But I have to do it all over again the next day. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8484.199999999999s)]
*  And the next day is the same thing. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8486.4s)]
*  My friend David Goggins, [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8488.0s)]
*  who's probably one of the most disciplined humans [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8489.199999999999s)]
*  that's ever lived, he talks about, he goes, [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8490.84s)]
*  he goes, it ain't easy. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8493.199999999999s)]
*  He goes, when I see my shoes in the morning, [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8495.08s)]
*  sometimes I stare at those motherfuckers [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8496.92s)]
*  for a half hour before I put them on. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8498.52s)]
*  But even he, even he, [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8500.84s)]
*  he'll stare at his sneakers for a half hour, [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8503.44s)]
*  but then he'll go run 50 miles. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8504.880000000001s)]
*  That's the difference between a person who can overcome [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8507.720000000001s)]
*  and a person who gives in to those feelings. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8511.560000000001s)]
*  And some people have never overcome. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8514.2s)]
*  So they don't even know the beautiful feeling [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8516.12s)]
*  of accomplishing something that's difficult. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8518.58s)]
*  Because they've never done it. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8520.84s)]
*  They've sort of embraced the idea [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8522.140000000001s)]
*  that it's fun to be lazy. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8523.800000000001s)]
*  It's great to be a slob. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8525.640000000001s)]
*  It's great to live in this world. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8527.480000000001s)]
*  And that's the last thing I'd ever want to do is exercise. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8529.02s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8532.52s)]
*  And they'll pretend that they're wise in their choice. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8534.08s)]
*  That there's some sort of frivolous nature [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8537.32s)]
*  to physical activity. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8542.36s)]
*  But physical activity is mental activity. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8544.34s)]
*  You just don't think of it that way [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8546.76s)]
*  because your mind is forcing your body to do the work. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8548.2s)]
*  You just don't think of it that way. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8552.42s)]
*  You think of it as being physical, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8553.960000000001s)]
*  brute grunt work for cavemen. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8555.720000000001s)]
*  But the reality is it's the mind [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8559.92s)]
*  that forces the body to do that. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8562.519999999999s)]
*  And you must have a strong mind in order to get that done. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8564.16s)]
*  So a strong mind is not just one that can do calculus. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8568.279999999999s)]
*  A strong mind is not just one that can write books. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8571.359999999999s)]
*  A strong mind is one that controls the body [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8573.56s)]
*  and all of its inherent weaknesses [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8576.88s)]
*  and all of its urges to be lazy and sedentary [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8579.519999999999s)]
*  and self-destructive. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8583.599999999999s)]
*  That's a strong mind. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8585.199999999999s)]
*  So if we put it back into terms of resistance, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8587.06s)]
*  let me try and phrase it in that sense, [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8590.019999999999s)]
*  again, the body doesn't wanna, [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8592.779999999999s)]
*  the body wants to stare at those gym shoes [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8597.18s)]
*  for half an hour, right? [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8599.58s)]
*  The body doesn't wanna do it. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8600.939999999999s)]
*  That's the force of resistance that, in my opinion, [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8602.58s)]
*  is spawned by the ego, right? [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8606.699999999999s)]
*  So as we overcome that and go to the gym [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8609.019999999999s)]
*  and get that sweat going or whatever it is [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8611.939999999999s)]
*  that we're gonna do, we defeat the ego [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8613.68s)]
*  and we're allowed to move into that greater, [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8617.12s)]
*  into the soul, into the self. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8619.32s)]
*  And so that's the battle in my terms of resistance [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8621.6s)]
*  that we fight every day. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8625.960000000001s)]
*  We wake up in the ego, right? [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8627.08s)]
*  Our eyes open, oh, fuck, I'm in this body. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8630.4s)]
*  I don't wanna do, I don't wanna go to the gym. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8633.84s)]
*  I don't wanna work hard. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8635.720000000001s)]
*  I don't wanna do anything. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8636.560000000001s)]
*  But we know that we have to do that, right? [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8637.800000000001s)]
*  That that's the path to getting out of this thing [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8641.1s)]
*  that will spiral down into the toilet bowl, right? [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8644.26s)]
*  So we do it. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8647.66s)]
*  We go to the gym, we work out whatever it is, [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8648.66s)]
*  and we get into the self. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8651.02s)]
*  We get into the greater mind. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8653.380000000001s)]
*  We've defeated that demon for that day. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8654.7s)]
*  But it will come back again. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8658.94s)]
*  And that seems to be, at least to me, [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8660.62s)]
*  that's what life sort of is, you know? [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8663.54s)]
*  At least in terms of our own, you know, [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8666.1s)]
*  our own physical body. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8668.62s)]
*  I forget about the family or the community, [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8669.6s)]
*  that's a whole other thing. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8672.24s)]
*  But at least within our own little physical envelope [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8673.800000000001s)]
*  of the body, that's the nature of the game every day, [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8676.800000000001s)]
*  and it never ends. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8679.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're in a constant state of struggle, [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8680.68s)]
*  mentally and physically, every day. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8682.92s)]
*  And you can take steps to mitigate that struggle [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8685.24s)]
*  and make it manageable and make your experience better [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8688.880000000001s)]
*  as a human being on Earth. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8693.0s)]
*  But it requires work. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8694.720000000001s)]
*  The same work that you discuss in the War of Art [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8696.960000000001s)]
*  with resistance, I think that applies to many, many things [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8700.32s)]
*  that people do during the day. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8703.880000000001s)]
*  How many people are out there that want to start a business? [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8705.2s)]
*  They have a desire to do this thing, [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8708.36s)]
*  but there's something that keeps them from doing it. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8710.4s)]
*  There's this little thing, they get lazy, [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8712.94s)]
*  they wanna watch TV, they eat ho-hos and drink Coca-Cola, [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8715.0s)]
*  and just don't ever do it. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8719.04s)]
*  And then maybe tomorrow, maybe one day, [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8721.08s)]
*  what are, well, in 2023, as soon as January comes around, [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8722.900000000001s)]
*  that's my New Year's resolution. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8727.34s)]
*  I mean, why do New Year's resolutions exist? [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8729.66s)]
*  They exist because you're not living right now. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8731.7s)]
*  If you were living correctly right now, [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8734.62s)]
*  you wouldn't need a New Year's resolution. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8736.86s)]
*  You would just live. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8739.62s)]
*  You would just keep on trucking. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8741.18s)]
*  That's what you would do. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8742.980000000001s)]
*  But we all have it inside of us. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8744.34s)]
*  We just have varying levels of it. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8746.68s)]
*  No one is a fully actualized, 100% realized potential. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8748.94s)]
*  No one. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8754.300000000001s)]
*  You do the best you think you can do, [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8755.140000000001s)]
*  given what you're available, what you have available [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8758.58s)]
*  in terms of resources right now, [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8761.1s)]
*  but maybe you could have been better. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8762.84s)]
*  And if you don't think that way, [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8765.1s)]
*  you're not going to get better. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8766.34s)]
*  Now, the positive side of that is, [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8768.34s)]
*  if the positive side of our resistance [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8771.060000000001s)]
*  that makes us wanna fuck off and eat ho-hos or whatever it is, [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8773.980000000001s)]
*  the positive side of that, as I was saying, [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8777.660000000002s)]
*  is that there is this underground river [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8779.660000000002s)]
*  flowing inside of us, which is our own creativity [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8783.980000000001s)]
*  and our own soul's expression, whatever that is, [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8788.060000000001s)]
*  which could be painting low riders [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8790.820000000002s)]
*  or doing your own motorcycles or writing a book [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8793.820000000002s)]
*  or making a movie or having a podcast or whatever it is. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8796.660000000002s)]
*  And I think that all that resistance, [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8799.26s)]
*  that negative thing, doesn't come out of nowhere. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8802.160000000002s)]
*  It comes to me out of a response [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8805.82s)]
*  to a dream that is not being fulfilled [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8809.82s)]
*  or not being addressed, not being taken care of, [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8812.38s)]
*  whatever that is, so that the doing the work [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8815.539999999999s)]
*  is not generic or not random. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8821.94s)]
*  It should be something towards something really specific [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8824.56s)]
*  that we, a dream that we have, [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8828.119999999999s)]
*  a creative dream that only we could do. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8830.3s)]
*  Only you can do what you're doing, Joe, [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8834.42s)]
*  and only I can do what I'm doing. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8836.3s)]
*  Nobody else can do it. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8837.78s)]
*  But that's there, that creative seed. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8839.04s)]
*  It's that river that's flowing towards the ocean. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8842.7s)]
*  And so if we can just believe in that river [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8846.14s)]
*  and then take the steps, like you say, whatever, [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8850.78s)]
*  and it's always difficult, [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8853.98s)]
*  because it's always in the teeth of resistance. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8855.5s)]
*  Whatever positive force there is, [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8858.22s)]
*  resistance is like an equal and opposite force [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8860.42s)]
*  trying to push us back. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8863.34s)]
*  So if we can just keep that, [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8864.78s)]
*  believe in that positive force, [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8866.62s)]
*  believe in that dream, that creativity, [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8868.14s)]
*  and push resistance out of the way, [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8870.42s)]
*  it's like we were talking before about project by project, [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8872.5s)]
*  whatever that project is, to surrender to it, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8875.18s)]
*  believe in it, and do it. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8878.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's a real value in that. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8881.14s)]
*  And there's also a real value in the way [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8882.78s)]
*  you've sort of defined it and laid it out [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8885.62s)]
*  so people could see it. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8888.66s)]
*  It's like that old expression, [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8890.18s)]
*  it's okay to have a snake in the room [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8891.74s)]
*  as long as you have the lights on. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8893.12s)]
*  I've never heard that before, yeah. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8894.68s)]
*  Well, there is gonna be a snake, that's for sure. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8896.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but you turn the lights on, [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8898.400000000001s)]
*  like look, there it is. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8899.880000000001s)]
*  Like it's always gonna be there, [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8901.640000000001s)]
*  but let's get over this fucking thing. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8903.44s)]
*  Like, and you can do that, [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8906.28s)]
*  and you can do it by showing up every day [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8907.320000000002s)]
*  and put in the work, [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8910.28s)]
*  and then in your other book about it, [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8911.240000000002s)]
*  Turning Pro, be a professional. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8913.640000000001s)]
*  Like this is what I do, [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8916.160000000002s)]
*  here's the guidelines for how to become a professional. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8917.0s)]
*  But you can apply that to so many different things. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8920.2s)]
*  Everything. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8922.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8923.82s)]
*  It's a weird thing about the human mind, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8924.92s)]
*  that resistance thing. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8927.88s)]
*  The other crazy part about resistance [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8929.16s)]
*  is that it really has no strength of its own. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8931.519999999999s)]
*  It's not like we're going up against a dragon [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8936.66s)]
*  or a lion or whatever it is. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8939.8s)]
*  Once we confront it, [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8941.96s)]
*  just like you get that third set and you start to sweat, [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8943.4s)]
*  it just goes away. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8946.64s)]
*  It just dissolves, right? [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8948.0s)]
*  So we become afraid of it, [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8950.06s)]
*  and the fear stops us from doing it. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8954.5s)]
*  But all it really needs to be is just dismissed. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8957.58s)]
*  And I'm sure that's what the Dalai Lama does, [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8961.42s)]
*  or any great avatar, just, [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8963.26s)]
*  I dismiss you, I dismiss you. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8965.26s)]
*  You know? [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8967.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8968.1s)]
*  And it goes away. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8968.939999999999s)]
*  But yet, if we don't do that, [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8970.539999999999s)]
*  it'll defeat us and run us right into the grave. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8972.1s)]
*  It's wild, right? [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8976.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8977.3s)]
*  You have all your years of discussing this [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8978.14s)]
*  and talking about it. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8980.66s)]
*  Isn't it fascinating though, [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8982.3s)]
*  that it still has a grip on you? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8983.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8985.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's not fascinating, but it's true. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8986.46s)]
*  I mean, I'm facing just as much. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8989.22s)]
*  I don't think it ever goes away. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8991.3s)]
*  It's a law of nature. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8993.019999999999s)]
*  It's a force of nature, like gravity. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8994.34s)]
*  Like when you get up to right. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8996.3s)]
*  If I lift this thing, it's gonna fall, you know? [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=8997.14s)]
*  When you get up to right, [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9000.5s)]
*  and you have the, like, [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9001.619999999999s)]
*  what is it the feeling like to you, [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9003.699999999999s)]
*  the resistance feeling? [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9005.58s)]
*  I'm afraid to do it, you know? [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9007.74s)]
*  It's just like going to the gym. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9010.5s)]
*  It's like, I have all the excuses. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9012.34s)]
*  I don't feel like doing it today. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9014.54s)]
*  I haven't got enough time, blah, blah, blah. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9015.94s)]
*  I have all the distractions. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9017.900000000001s)]
*  I have fear. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9019.62s)]
*  I say to myself, this thing you're working, [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9020.66s)]
*  you're gonna work three years on this thing. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9024.140000000001s)]
*  You're only gonna embarrass yourself. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9025.900000000001s)]
*  It's a piece of shit, you know? [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9027.5s)]
*  That kind of thing. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9029.220000000001s)]
*  All that sort of stuff. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9030.060000000001s)]
*  But I will say, having done it for 30 years or so, [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9031.18s)]
*  like you at the gym or whatever, [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9036.060000000001s)]
*  I know if I do the work, [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9037.74s)]
*  I'm gonna feel good at the end of the day. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9041.060000000001s)]
*  I know it, because I've done it so many times. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9042.62s)]
*  And so I just have to keep reminding myself of that. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9045.34s)]
*  And then I have my various little tricks [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9048.02s)]
*  to help me get over it. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9050.220000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't go away, ever. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9052.5s)]
*  You know, I don't think it ever does for anybody. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9054.74s)]
*  It's a force of nature. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9056.94s)]
*  It's there. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9058.1s)]
*  Yeah, and momentum really helps. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9058.98s)]
*  Momentum is tremendous, yes. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9061.1s)]
*  If you're doing it a lot. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9062.26s)]
*  It's everything. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9063.1s)]
*  Momentum and habit, which are the same thing, really. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9064.14s)]
*  Habit is just momentum, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9067.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I hate vacations. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9072.18s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9075.099999999999s)]
*  Me too. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9076.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9077.06s)]
*  Well, I like them in that [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9077.9s)]
*  I actually do enjoy some aspects of it. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9079.539999999999s)]
*  But there's always this part, [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9082.3s)]
*  because I think we do need a mental reset, [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9084.14s)]
*  especially if you're a person like me, [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9086.66s)]
*  that's really kind of burning the candles [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9088.38s)]
*  at both ends all the time. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9089.939999999999s)]
*  Like sometimes I just need to sit on a beach [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9092.06s)]
*  with a margarita and just relax. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9094.66s)]
*  But that's the part, [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9096.22s)]
*  there's a little fucking demon in my head [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9099.42s)]
*  that's like, what are you doing? [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9101.5s)]
*  You ain't doing shit. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9103.34s)]
*  You ain't doing shit. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9104.3s)]
*  You're not getting nothing done. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9105.5s)]
*  And then it's hard to get right back to work again. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9107.02s)]
*  It's hard to like, once I'm working all the time, [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9110.98s)]
*  then it's almost like I wake up [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9113.9s)]
*  and I'm just ready to go to work. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9115.26s)]
*  I'm ready to go. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9116.42s)]
*  But if I just take a long time off and I'm not doing it, [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9117.38s)]
*  it's like, ooh, it's difficult. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9120.46s)]
*  Did you ever know Eddie Giuliani? [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9122.98s)]
*  No. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9125.779999999999s)]
*  The bodybuilder? [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9126.619999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9127.46s)]
*  Who just tragically died a couple of years ago. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9128.3s)]
*  He's from Arnold's generation. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9129.42s)]
*  And he was a sort of a protege of Jack LaLanne. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9131.66s)]
*  And he said that Jack LaLanne used to say to him, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9135.82s)]
*  it's okay to take a day off from training, [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9139.02s)]
*  but on that day, you're not allowed to eat. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9141.779999999999s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. And he also said, [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9144.74s)]
*  every day that you take off equals six days [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9146.939999999999s)]
*  once you get back on it. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9150.539999999999s)]
*  So that's probably why, whether that's right or not. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9152.18s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9155.42s)]
*  When we take vacations, we feel it, right? [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9156.34s)]
*  Yes. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9159.460000000001s)]
*  What a psycho. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9160.66s)]
*  You can take a day off training, [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9161.82s)]
*  but you're not allowed to eat. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9162.98s)]
*  You're not allowed to eat. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9163.82s)]
*  Wow. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9164.7s)]
*  Well, Jack LaLanne was such an animal. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9165.74s)]
*  That's the guy right there? [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9168.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9168.9s)]
*  That's Eddie Giuliani. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9169.74s)]
*  Shredded. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9170.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9171.82s)]
*  Yeah, he's shredded. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9172.7s)]
*  But the thing about Jack LaLanne is like, [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9173.94s)]
*  I think he was 90, he was pulling boats. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9176.18s)]
*  Yeah, tug boats with his teeth. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9179.9s)]
*  How old was he when he was doing that? [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9182.58s)]
*  Something like that. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9183.94s)]
*  Something crazy. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9184.78s)]
*  Like he basically did that until his body like, [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9186.220000000001s)]
*  enough, check please. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9188.82s)]
*  Here's my theory on vacations, for whatever it's worth. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9191.02s)]
*  And I'm like the worst vacation taker in the world. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9193.380000000001s)]
*  I feel like people ask me sometimes, [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9197.02s)]
*  what do you do between books? [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9200.66s)]
*  And my theory is there should never be a between books. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9202.86s)]
*  You should, on the day that you finish this one book, [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9206.220000000001s)]
*  you start the next one. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9209.66s)]
*  Call it whatever, project, whatever, whatever. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9210.820000000002s)]
*  But what I feel is like, say I've started a new one, right? [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9213.060000000001s)]
*  I just wanna keep working [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9217.74s)]
*  until I've got some momentum going. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9219.18s)]
*  Like I've got a beachhead on that new book. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9222.380000000001s)]
*  And I say, okay, I've got my toes on the ground. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9224.5s)]
*  I know I can, then I'll take a vacation. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9227.380000000001s)]
*  You know, when I know I've sort of got enough momentum [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9230.060000000001s)]
*  that if I stop for a week or I stop for a period of time, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9233.26s)]
*  that momentum will still be there. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9236.460000000001s)]
*  You know? [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9238.62s)]
*  But I feel guilty every day that I'm on that vacation. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9239.46s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9243.259999999998s)]
*  I know, it's crazy, I do too. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9244.099999999999s)]
*  But I've gotten way better at it. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9245.619999999999s)]
*  My wife's helping with that. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9247.179999999998s)]
*  She doesn't feel guilty at all. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9248.339999999998s)]
*  Women definitely help you. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9249.179999999998s)]
*  Yeah, right, yeah. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9250.5s)]
*  So you- [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9251.339999999998s)]
*  I don't know why women don't feel bad about that, [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9252.179999999998s)]
*  but they don't. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9253.939999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9254.779999999999s)]
*  So your thing is finish the book, start a new book, [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9255.599999999999s)]
*  get it going, and then you get to get a vacation. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9258.9s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9260.3s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9261.259999999998s)]
*  And in fact, I'll go a little farther than that. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9262.099999999999s)]
*  While you're finishing book number six, let's say, [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9264.46s)]
*  you should already be starting book number seven. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9269.46s)]
*  You know, outline it or whatever you need to do. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9272.859999999999s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9275.099999999999s)]
*  So that there's not ever that day when you got, [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9275.939999999999s)]
*  look at the page and you go, [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9280.58s)]
*  what the fuck am I gonna do now? [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9281.939999999999s)]
*  You know? [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9283.98s)]
*  Get something started so you've got, you know, [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9284.82s)]
*  20 pages, 40 pages, whatever. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9288.46s)]
*  So you feel, okay, no problem. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9290.5s)]
*  I'll just, I've already been working on it. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9291.9s)]
*  I've already got a beachhead. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9294.099999999999s)]
*  I'll just keep going. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9295.66s)]
*  That's the same thing that most comedians do. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9296.66s)]
*  I'll do that. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9299.1s)]
*  Yeah, when I'm writing a special, [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9299.94s)]
*  like if I'm finishing a special, [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9301.94s)]
*  I already have like five or 10 minutes for the next special. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9303.54s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9306.220000000001s)]
*  Or five or 10 minutes for the next act. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9307.060000000001s)]
*  So I'm not starting from like, what am I gonna talk about? [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9309.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9311.78s)]
*  There's something, and then from there, [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9312.62s)]
*  I've got a scaffolding and then I'll build off of that. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9315.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9317.5s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9318.58s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9319.42s)]
*  Well, I certainly agree with that. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9320.24s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of guys like, say if you have a, [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9321.98s)]
*  like I was just talking to Chris Rock [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9325.54s)]
*  and he has a new special that he's working on [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9327.26s)]
*  and he's currently doing sets where he's doing as much as, [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9330.7s)]
*  like I think when he was in Austin, [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9334.86s)]
*  he did an hour and 40 minutes, [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9336.02s)]
*  but his special will only be one hour. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9338.5s)]
*  So what he's going to do is he's going to tighten that down [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9340.86s)]
*  and edit that down to the very best one hour [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9344.62s)]
*  that's possible out of that hour and 40 minutes of material. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9349.06s)]
*  But once that hour special comes out, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9351.86s)]
*  now Chris has 40 solid minutes of other material [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9354.660000000002s)]
*  that he can tour with and that he could add onto. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9358.86s)]
*  And so for a guy like Chris Rock, [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9361.58s)]
*  adding 20 minutes onto that, not that hard. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9363.34s)]
*  And then he'll probably do the same thing. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9366.54s)]
*  He'll probably develop an hour and a half, [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9368.34s)]
*  hour and 45 minutes of new stuff, [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9370.18s)]
*  then film a special and then still have [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9372.62s)]
*  another 45 minutes of stuff. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9375.300000000001s)]
*  And then so you always got bread in the oven. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9376.740000000002s)]
*  Ah, yeah. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9380.900000000001s)]
*  You always got something cooking. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9381.740000000002s)]
*  Ah. Yeah. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9382.58s)]
*  Boy, it would be a fascinating documentary [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9383.46s)]
*  to put the camera over Chris Rock's shoulder. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9385.98s)]
*  Sure. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9388.619999999999s)]
*  And ask, why did you pick that one? [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9389.46s)]
*  How did you structure this? [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9392.019999999999s)]
*  What were you thinking? [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9393.339999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9394.339999999998s)]
*  It would be intrusive though, I think. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9395.3s)]
*  Like probably, I don't know. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9397.82s)]
*  Maybe, but it'd be fascinating. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9399.58s)]
*  It'll be fascinating for us. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9401.06s)]
*  But for someone that's in the middle of the creative process, [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9402.46s)]
*  like if you did that with a Gary Clark Jr. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9405.619999999999s)]
*  or something like that, why are you playing that? [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9407.66s)]
*  Like what's the, like, get the fuck out of here. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9409.22s)]
*  I'm trying to play. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9410.939999999999s)]
*  I think for like a lot of artists, [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9412.42s)]
*  they're in the moment, right? [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9414.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9416.3s)]
*  And to stick a camera in their face [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9417.14s)]
*  while they're doing it would kinda like [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9420.3s)]
*  fuck with the thing. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9422.5s)]
*  Probably. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9423.54s)]
*  You know, it's like when they talk about quantum physics. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9424.38s)]
*  Ah, right, yeah. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9426.38s)]
*  And they talk about the observing of the thing [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9427.22s)]
*  changes the thing. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9429.22s)]
*  It's probably a quality of that with everything. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9430.78s)]
*  Maybe there'd be a way to film it [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9433.82s)]
*  and have him not talk about it in the moment, [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9435.82s)]
*  but afterwards. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9438.1s)]
*  Yeah, perhaps. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9439.02s)]
*  But even just the presence of cameras [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9440.82s)]
*  constantly filming him would probably be. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9442.58s)]
*  Be self-conscious. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9444.300000000001s)]
*  Your ego would get in there [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9445.220000000001s)]
*  and you'd start to fuck yourself up. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9446.380000000001s)]
*  You get in your own way. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9448.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you need a certain amount of like real freedom [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9449.9s)]
*  in that regard to just. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9454.02s)]
*  Oh, I know what I meant to ask you, Joe. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9454.98s)]
*  I heard a thing with Sam Kinison. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9456.9s)]
*  I mean, he was talking about writing his material. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9460.26s)]
*  And he said the hardest part was the transitions. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9462.460000000001s)]
*  Could you talk to that for a second? [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9467.14s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9469.580000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's the hardest part. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9470.62s)]
*  No, not for me. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9473.02s)]
*  The hardest part for me is the initial premise. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9474.54s)]
*  Those are the hardest. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9478.86s)]
*  Those are basically patches of fertile ground. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9480.26s)]
*  You need to come up with these patches of fertile ground [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9484.060000000001s)]
*  and then you can grow things in them. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9486.02s)]
*  So when I have a premise, [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9487.62s)]
*  like whatever the premise is about, [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9489.300000000001s)]
*  now it's just once I know that things are growing in it, [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9491.42s)]
*  I'm like, okay, good, we got something. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9494.54s)]
*  Now let's formulate it. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9497.02s)]
*  But to think about a thing to talk about [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9498.58s)]
*  and to have that thing worthy [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9501.06s)]
*  of an extraordinary amount of time. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9502.66s)]
*  Because if I'm gonna develop a bit, [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9505.22s)]
*  like I used to have this bit about a guy [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9507.18s)]
*  who broke into the White House. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9508.62s)]
*  And that big took months of my time [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9510.58s)]
*  to figure out how to say it right [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9513.14s)]
*  and all the twists and turns and saying it away [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9514.82s)]
*  that it's the most palatable to people [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9518.18s)]
*  that are listening to it and the funniest. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9520.42s)]
*  And you gotta find a premise. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9522.1s)]
*  But once you find a premise in that premise, [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9524.86s)]
*  you smile when you're thinking about it, [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9526.82s)]
*  then you got fertile ground. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9529.22s)]
*  And the transitions, I mean, [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9531.1s)]
*  it just requires some creativity. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9533.42s)]
*  I don't think it's that hard to transition [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9536.24s)]
*  from one thing to another thing. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9537.94s)]
*  I don't think it's that. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9539.18s)]
*  But Sam's time was, [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9540.9s)]
*  he's from the late 80s, right? [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9544.34s)]
*  And Sam Kinison really became famous in like 86. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9546.74s)]
*  And there was no one like Sam Kinison before Sam Kinison. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9550.02s)]
*  So his style of comedy was very new. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9553.94s)]
*  I have benefited from the fact that he existed [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9557.26s)]
*  and that Bill Hicks existed [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9560.58s)]
*  and that these guys who kind of had that similar [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9562.460000000001s)]
*  sort of rambunctious, energetic, introspective, [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9566.18s)]
*  brilliant set, this way of doing standup [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9572.380000000001s)]
*  that was very different than say Bob Hope [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9577.66s)]
*  or a lot of the Jerry Seinfeld observational comedians. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9581.38s)]
*  These guys already carved the path. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9586.619999999999s)]
*  So maybe for guys that came up like myself after Kinison, [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9589.58s)]
*  it's not as difficult. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9595.859999999999s)]
*  You can kind of see how to do it better. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9597.74s)]
*  They've trail, they've blazed the trail. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9600.939999999999s)]
*  How do you come up with a premise? [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9604.38s)]
*  It depends. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9606.9s)]
*  Sometimes there's an interesting thing [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9608.1s)]
*  that is in the news or that I've encountered [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9611.5s)]
*  or I've seen in a museum or read an article about. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9615.42s)]
*  And then I'll just like again, I'll write essays. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9618.5s)]
*  Write essays and from that essay, I'll extract something [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9621.26s)]
*  and that something is actually viable. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9624.42s)]
*  There's something there. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9626.460000000001s)]
*  Sometimes it's just an encounter in the real world. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9628.02s)]
*  It's like something that's happened to me. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9631.140000000001s)]
*  Sometimes it's from a discussion I've had with a friend [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9632.78s)]
*  and then I'll say something and they start laughing [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9637.18s)]
*  and I'm like, I gotta write that shit down. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9639.34s)]
*  So do you feel like you're sort of always on the lookout [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9641.62s)]
*  for premises? Always, yeah. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9644.58s)]
*  Particularly like now because I just recorded something. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9645.78s)]
*  So particularly now, now I'm like in that period [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9648.300000000001s)]
*  where I'm just constantly searching around. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9650.94s)]
*  And then once I develop like a real set, [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9652.86s)]
*  then it transitions to concentrating on those bits [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9656.62s)]
*  all the time, try to make them as good as possible. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9661.220000000001s)]
*  Like to always think, is that the right way? [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9664.220000000001s)]
*  Am I doing it the right way? [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9665.94s)]
*  Maybe I should change it, maybe I should shorten it, [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9667.9s)]
*  maybe I should lengthen it, [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9669.06s)]
*  maybe I should put it in the beginning. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9670.1s)]
*  Sometimes a bit changes when you move it around your set. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9672.619999999999s)]
*  Like sometimes of a bit that's like you're doing [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9675.9s)]
*  40 minutes into your act, it does well, [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9678.019999999999s)]
*  but if you did it 10 minutes into your act, [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9680.5s)]
*  it does even better. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9682.26s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9683.58s)]
*  Ah, yeah. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9684.42s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9685.26s)]
*  It's like things have their place and you don't know [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9686.18s)]
*  where that place is until you move them around. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9688.82s)]
*  Like you ever rearrange your office? [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9690.74s)]
*  Like I think maybe my desk over here, [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9693.26s)]
*  put my plant here and then you do it like, [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9695.22s)]
*  I like this better. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9697.539999999999s)]
*  I don't know why. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9699.179999999998s)]
*  You know, what is that? [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9700.019999999999s)]
*  You know, something. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9700.939999999999s)]
*  Can you teach comedy? [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9702.46s)]
*  You can't teach someone who's not funny. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9705.42s)]
*  I don't think you can. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9707.34s)]
*  But you can show people there's certain principles [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9708.619999999999s)]
*  of comedy like the economy of words, surprise, [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9712.619999999999s)]
*  the way you say things is like jokes are not just a joke. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9717.9s)]
*  It's the way the joke sounds. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9723.18s)]
*  Just like a song is not just the words of the song. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9724.82s)]
*  It's the sound of the voice. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9727.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9729.26s)]
*  Yeah, there's something to the way things sound [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9730.42s)]
*  and the pacing and the timing and you can get better [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9734.42s)]
*  at that, but unfortunately, some people [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9738.02s)]
*  that just aren't funny. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9740.859999999999s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9742.02s)]
*  And I don't think you could teach them that. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9742.859999999999s)]
*  And I don't know why. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9743.98s)]
*  I don't know why. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9745.619999999999s)]
*  It's just a thing. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9747.26s)]
*  The problem with comedy, class, [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9750.1s)]
*  the problem with comedy classes is the vast majority [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9751.7s)]
*  are taught by people who aren't funny. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9756.1s)]
*  They're not. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9758.42s)]
*  I think that's true, yeah. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9759.26s)]
*  It's true. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9760.08s)]
*  So Chris Rock's not teaching any comedy classes. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9760.92s)]
*  He does it every time. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9762.820000000002s)]
*  He's working on his own stuff. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9764.060000000001s)]
*  Dave Chappelle's not teaching any comedy classes. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9765.86s)]
*  You can learn things from other comedians, [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9768.820000000002s)]
*  but generally they don't share those things with you [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9771.5s)]
*  unless you've achieved a certain level of competence. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9773.66s)]
*  You know, it's... [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9777.62s)]
*  One thing that comedy classes do though, [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9779.54s)]
*  even if they're taught by people who aren't that funny, [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9782.54s)]
*  is they give you an opportunity to get on stage. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9784.78s)]
*  Most comedy classes, what they'll do is they'll, [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9788.300000000001s)]
*  you go through a course for a few weeks [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9790.720000000001s)]
*  and then you practice and then one day you'll go to a show [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9792.580000000002s)]
*  and you'll have like a showcase where everybody [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9796.62s)]
*  invites family and friends and there'll be, you know, [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9798.580000000002s)]
*  50, 100 people in the audience and then every student [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9800.980000000001s)]
*  will go up and do five minutes. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9804.2s)]
*  And that's very valuable because then you get your feet [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9806.060000000001s)]
*  wet and you start thinking about it and like, [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9809.3s)]
*  I think I can do this. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9810.7s)]
*  I think I can be a comedian. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9811.98s)]
*  And then it goes on to be something you do regularly [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9813.82s)]
*  and then you get better at it, just like everything else. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9816.62s)]
*  Like playing golf or writing books. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9819.1s)]
*  But if you don't have the spark, you can't make a fire. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9821.7s)]
*  And I don't know what that spark is. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9825.82s)]
*  I don't think anybody knows because everybody's [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9828.26s)]
*  as different. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9829.94s)]
*  Were you always a funny kid? [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9830.78s)]
*  Not necessarily, no. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9833.1s)]
*  I don't think I was. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9834.82s)]
*  I learned how to be funny mostly during my martial arts time [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9836.42s)]
*  because I was like, it was like gallows humor. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9842.26s)]
*  Like I was the one who was making everybody laugh [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9845.34s)]
*  when we were riding a bus to a tournament. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9847.5s)]
*  We're all gonna compete in this martial arts tournament. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9850.539999999999s)]
*  Or when we were all about to spar, [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9852.58s)]
*  I was the one who would be cracking jokes [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9854.74s)]
*  to cut the tension. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9856.66s)]
*  And then one of my friends, my friend Steve Graham [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9858.44s)]
*  was still a good friend of mine today. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9861.82s)]
*  He talked me into doing it when I was, [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9863.7s)]
*  I was like 19 when he first said it to me. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9865.900000000001s)]
*  He's like, you should be a comedian. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9868.820000000002s)]
*  And I was like, really? [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9870.78s)]
*  I was like, you think I'm funny? [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9872.380000000001s)]
*  Like my sense of humor is only good for psychos. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9873.66s)]
*  I'm like, you think I'm funny because you like me. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9877.060000000001s)]
*  I go, if you didn't like me, just think I'm an asshole. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9879.900000000001s)]
*  But he was like, I'm telling you, man. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9882.66s)]
*  Like the way you can do impressions, [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9885.66s)]
*  the way you fuck with people. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9887.26s)]
*  He's like, you're really, you should be a comedian. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9889.58s)]
*  And I never even considered it until he said, [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9892.74s)]
*  I always loved comedy, but I never considered it [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9894.699999999999s)]
*  until he brought it up. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9896.98s)]
*  Well, it's a big leap. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9898.4s)]
*  I mean, that's not something that, you know, [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9899.38s)]
*  your mom and dad say to you, [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9901.16s)]
*  unless you're like the class clown. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9902.539999999999s)]
*  My mom was the opposite. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9904.42s)]
*  My mom said I wasn't funny. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9905.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9906.9s)]
*  She's like, I never thought you were very funny. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9908.699999999999s)]
*  I'm like, mom, come on. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9910.38s)]
*  You know, this is when I was like 21, just starting out. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9914.699999999999s)]
*  And she was worried for me. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9916.86s)]
*  She was worried that I was trying to become a comedian. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9918.96s)]
*  She was like, wow, you're already successful. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9920.82s)]
*  She didn't want you to be a disappointed. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9923.1s)]
*  Yeah, stick with what you're doing. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9924.539999999999s)]
*  That's always parents, they always want to play it safe. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9927.22s)]
*  They always want their child to have a safe life. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9930.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9935.98s)]
*  It's hard to give people advice [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9937.26s)]
*  because you don't know their mind. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9939.38s)]
*  You don't know their life. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9941.539999999999s)]
*  You don't know, even if you know it, [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9942.58s)]
*  you really only know a little. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9944.02s)]
*  You know what you've seen and what they show you. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9945.98s)]
*  You don't know what it feels like to be them. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9948.36s)]
*  You don't know how their mind works. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9951.02s)]
*  And so to give someone advice on, [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9953.1s)]
*  I think you should go start a business about X. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9955.54s)]
*  Like, says who? [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9959.3s)]
*  Like, who knows? [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9960.62s)]
*  They have to figure it out on their own. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9961.78s)]
*  But I think what you've done, [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9963.62s)]
*  particularly with the war of art, [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9965.82s)]
*  is you've given people tools. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9967.38s)]
*  You've given people an understanding of the landscape [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9970.34s)]
*  and you've given people some tools that they can use [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9972.5s)]
*  to better themselves and to create better art [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9975.5s)]
*  and to create a better life for themselves, [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9978.1s)]
*  to get over the bullshit that holds a lot of us back. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9981.179999999998s)]
*  Well, I hope that's true. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9985.06s)]
*  It's true. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9986.22s)]
*  But certainly, I think the medium of a book, [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9987.06s)]
*  and actually a podcast like we're doing now, [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9990.58s)]
*  is a good way to expose a new idea to somebody [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9993.3s)]
*  because they can absorb it in the privacy [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=9999.8s)]
*  of their own mind. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10002.619999999999s)]
*  Nobody's pointing at them and say, do this, right? [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10004.5s)]
*  So they can read in a page and say, [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10007.019999999999s)]
*  that's me, I'm fucked, you know? [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10009.3s)]
*  And say to themselves, you know what, I gotta change that. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10011.26s)]
*  And nobody has to see that. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10014.42s)]
*  Nobody, they're not embarrassed by that. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10016.46s)]
*  They can maybe make a decision and say, [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10019.5s)]
*  okay, I'm gonna do a sober October [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10021.9s)]
*  or I'm gonna do something like that. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10024.58s)]
*  So a book is a great way to do that [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10026.779999999999s)]
*  because it's such a private medium. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10029.02s)]
*  Mm-hmm, yeah, that's a good point. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10030.82s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, sir. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10033.779999999999s)]
*  It's always good to see you. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10035.58s)]
*  I really appreciate you. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10036.66s)]
*  I appreciate everything you've done [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10037.539999999999s)]
*  and I'm glad we got to do this again. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10039.66s)]
*  Hey, thanks, Joe, thanks for having me. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10040.74s)]
*  My pleasure. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10042.58s)]
*  Keep me in the rolodex. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10043.42s)]
*  I will. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10044.699999999999s)]
*  And if we haven't exhausted everything that we've done. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10045.539999999999s)]
*  No, we'll do it again. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10047.26s)]
*  We'll do it again. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10048.26s)]
*  We'll certainly do it again. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10049.1s)]
*  But seriously, like I say, if it wasn't for you, [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10049.92s)]
*  the war of art would not have reached the level [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10052.06s)]
*  that it could. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10054.94s)]
*  Every time you say something nice about it, [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10055.779999999999s)]
*  it sells a few more copies. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10058.779999999999s)]
*  So thank you very much. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10060.58s)]
*  Well, I'm very happy to help. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10061.42s)]
*  And thanks for your faith in that and in me. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M8jBaA8_Gk&t=10062.26s)]
