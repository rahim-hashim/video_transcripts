# Joe Rogan Experience #1968 - Jason Everman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5.72s)]
*  Well thanks for coming man, appreciate it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=12.44s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for asking. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=14.68s)]
*  You've had a wild life dude. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=16.36s)]
*  How the fuck does one go from playing in Nirvana and Soundgarden to being a soldier? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  It's a longer story. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=25.6s)]
*  I want to hear it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=28.68s)]
*  How long an answer you want? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=30.28s)]
*  We got plenty of time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=31.66s)]
*  So I guess being a professional rock musician was something I kind of fell into. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=39.0s)]
*  It wasn't something that I had a dream of. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=46.6s)]
*  I love playing in bands, I love playing music, but it was like at this punk rock level where [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  you were never going to make a living at it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=56.28s)]
*  It was just something fun to do. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  And then I started playing with Nirvana and even at that level still not making money [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=62.2s)]
*  from it, but touring. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=69.94s)]
*  Was it the early days of Nirvana? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=72.08s)]
*  So Nirvana wasn't worldwide at that point? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=74.16s)]
*  I mean on the Seattle level like one of the smaller bands. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=81.12s)]
*  Like there was bands like Mudhoney and Soundgarden that were better known than Nirvana was at [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=85.72s)]
*  the time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=90.76s)]
*  And you played for Soundgarden too, which is also hilarious. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=91.76s)]
*  And when did you, so in the beginning, did you have friction with the band? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=97.4s)]
*  Like why did you wind up leaving? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=103.68s)]
*  So with Nirvana, I guess initially when I came on board, Kurt wanted a second guitar [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=105.88s)]
*  player for the live show basically. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=115.6s)]
*  Have a heavier sound live, take some of the guitar playing responsibility off him so he [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=120.52s)]
*  could concentrate on vocals, that kind of thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  And initially I thought I was going to be able to contribute to the band creatively [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  And then it got to the point where I realized that wasn't going to happen. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  The same thing happened with Chad, the drummer, I think. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=136.23999999999998s)]
*  And it was like everyone in the band, including myself, was like very poor communicators, like [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=139.44s)]
*  a lot of passive aggression. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=147.44s)]
*  And I mean, we were kids, you know. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=149.76s)]
*  How old were you at the time? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=153.04s)]
*  20, I think. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=154.04s)]
*  And yeah, I just, I wasn't equipped for it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=156.24s)]
*  And became more and more unhappy with the situation and then ended up leaving. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=160.24s)]
*  So was it that like when you would try to put creative input in, it would get shut down [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  or they weren't interested or Kurt wasn't interested? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=172.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  So like on the rare time where we actually rehearsed as a band, which was not a lot, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  Kurt would kind of half-heartedly like, hey, who has ideas? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=185.0s)]
*  And like I'd throw a couple ideas out and then Chad, like a very accomplished musician [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=188.72s)]
*  in his own right, would throw some ideas out and then it would just kind of be glossed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=194.04s)]
*  over and like, okay, here's the new song I wrote, you know, and start learning that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=199.44s)]
*  So it was very... [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=205.0s)]
*  Ego-centered. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=208.0s)]
*  Cursory, you know. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=209.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=210.0s)]
*  So he kind of like threw it out there, but then it wasn't going to go anywhere. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=211.12s)]
*  And so you went for Nirvana first and then The Soundgarden? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=215.92s)]
*  Yeah, like I left, we did a US tour, like the first full US tour that Nirvana did in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=220.52s)]
*  88 or 89, I can't remember what year it was, but I think it was still the 80s. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=226.44s)]
*  And like I left at the end of that tour, like, okay, I'm done. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=234.52s)]
*  I'm like, nice little foray into rock and roll, but I'm going to do something else. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  And when I got home, I was planning on going trekking in the Himalayas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=245.2s)]
*  Like... [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=252.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=253.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was the next thing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=254.2s)]
*  It's like, okay, this was a nice diversion, but I'm going to kind of fulfill this dream [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=255.2s)]
*  I've had since I was a kid of like trekking in the Himalayas. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=260.36s)]
*  So like I went to Mesker's Maps in Seattle and was buying maps of the Himalaya, Nepal [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=262.96s)]
*  and Tibet and all this stuff and like getting gear sorted. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's what I was going to do. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=271.6s)]
*  And then at some point that summer or fall, I can't remember what time of year it was, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=273.64000000000004s)]
*  into summer, Kim from Soundgarden called me and was like, hey, Hiro, their bass player [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  then like quit. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  Do you want to audition for the band? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=291.16s)]
*  I was like, you know, at that point, like Soundgarden was my favorite Seattle band, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=293.12s)]
*  like hands down. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=297.32s)]
*  And it was like, okay, you know, fully not believing I'd ever get chosen. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=298.32s)]
*  And then you did. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=305.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=306.76s)]
*  And how did that end? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=307.76s)]
*  I got fired. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  What happened? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  It's complicated, but I think at the end of the day, I wasn't getting along with Chris [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  that well, the singer. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=320.44s)]
*  And you know, obviously, you know, who's going to go? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=323.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=326.44s)]
*  Yeah, it was me. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=327.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=328.44s)]
*  So how does that translate into becoming a soldier? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=329.84s)]
*  I mean, there's more. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=335.6s)]
*  There's more to the story than that because there was still like, I basically like getting [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=339.04s)]
*  fired from Soundgarden, like put me in a pretty bad tailspin. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=346.08s)]
*  I mean, it was a rough patch in my life for sure. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  And so in order to kind of cut this tailspin off, like I had to do something radical. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=357.52s)]
*  And what I did was ended up moving to New York. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=368.24s)]
*  And so I mean, there's more to the story than that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=372.36s)]
*  But moved to New York, like basically, you know, I grew up in rural Western Washington. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=378.44s)]
*  Like, so it's kind of polar opposite to what I what my experience was, like got a job in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=384.44s)]
*  a warehouse, got an apartment and kind of started my New York life and did that for [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  a couple of years. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=396.58000000000004s)]
*  What was your plan when you moved to New York? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=397.58000000000004s)]
*  Just wanted to try it, experience life in the city. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=399.68s)]
*  I think the main plan was like, like, get out of this funk that I was in. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, how old were you at the time? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=409.44s)]
*  Twenty one, twenty two, maybe just young guy trying to figure out life. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=412.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=416.12s)]
*  I like the Soundgarden thing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=417.12s)]
*  Getting fired from Soundgarden like it broke my heart. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=420.35999999999996s)]
*  It was it was a bad spot for me. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  And because I love that band and it wasn't it wasn't about, you know, I never thought [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  they would get as big as they did. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  Honestly, it kind of surprised me when they did, because, yeah, they're a great band. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=433.64s)]
*  But I think I always thought they were a little too quirky to be huge despite, you know, the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  Chris Factor, like, you know, this genetically engineered rock star. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=442.84s)]
*  But I always thought they're a little too weird to be have like mainstream success, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=449.52s)]
*  which was fine with me. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=452.84s)]
*  Yeah, they'd be like like a big indie band like Sonic Youth or Butthole Surfers, like [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=453.84s)]
*  that level. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=458.52s)]
*  You know, and but it was more like I just love that band and I love playing with them. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=459.52s)]
*  And like having that taken away. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it really fucked me up for a bit. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=468.64s)]
*  So you just went to New York City to try to experience a different life. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=472.96s)]
*  Just running for my demons, you know, like like that old rubric. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=478.67999999999995s)]
*  But you know, your demons tend to follow you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=484.32s)]
*  Always. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=487.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=488.0s)]
*  What were your demons? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=489.0s)]
*  You want to go down that rabbit hole? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=490.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=492.76s)]
*  There's a few. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=493.76s)]
*  Growing up, you know, like and like everyone has a story, right? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=497.88s)]
*  Like when my childhood was bad and my childhood wasn't bad necessarily, but it was it was [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=501.52s)]
*  there was a lot of unhappiness for sure. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=508.52s)]
*  And it stemmed from like my mother and my stepdaughter not being happy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=511.32s)]
*  You know, they're I don't feel bad talking about it now because they're both gone now, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=518.32s)]
*  but they you know, they probably shouldn't have gotten married. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=525.04s)]
*  And they both. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=529.0s)]
*  And that's one thing is like an adult, like looking back, you can kind of you see your [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=530.96s)]
*  parents as human beings and not like these magical creatures that like feed you and take [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=537.5999999999999s)]
*  care of you. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=542.3599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=543.3599999999999s)]
*  And you know, they got they got their their dreams and their their, you know, crush dreams. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=544.3599999999999s)]
*  Like they're humans. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=549.9599999999999s)]
*  So I have a lot of compassion for them now as an adult. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=551.76s)]
*  It's like, oh, I get it now. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=553.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like they weren't bad people. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=555.3199999999999s)]
*  They were just people. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=558.7199999999999s)]
*  And it's just being a child in that environment. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=559.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because that because that's you have nothing to compare it to. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=562.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=566.3599999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, I guess this is what being a kid is, you know, kind of sucks. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=568.16s)]
*  Yeah, it can. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=572.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=575.24s)]
*  But through that suck, a lot of times that's where you sort of get your drive. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=576.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, I'm a firm believer that growth is the result of trauma. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=579.52s)]
*  Like you need that that thesis antithesis synthesis, you know, that that like Stephen [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=585.48s)]
*  J. Gould called it pertaining to evolution punctuated equilibrium or like evolution tends [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  to stay stable if there's no pressures. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  But as soon as there's this introduction of new pressures, usually the result of some [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=605.8s)]
*  cataclysmic event, it's not a gradual thing. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=610.28s)]
*  It's usually sudden and extreme. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=612.92s)]
*  And that's where these new evolutionary pressures are introduced. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=616.0s)]
*  And it's like on this level of species, you adapt and survive or you die off. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=618.76s)]
*  So I kind of like putting that template on the individual. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  Like you kind of cruise through life and then something fucked up happens. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=630.44s)]
*  And then, you know, hopefully you step up and grow from it, you know, learn from it, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=633.28s)]
*  all that stuff. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=638.44s)]
*  So you go to New York City, you were there for a few years. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=639.78s)]
*  What were you doing while you were there? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=643.36s)]
*  So initially I worked in a warehouse and it was it was fine. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=645.14s)]
*  You know, I was like paying my rent, living in Alphabet City, like having having this [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=649.7s)]
*  urban life that I never thought I would have had otherwise. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=656.26s)]
*  Did you know anybody there? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=659.5s)]
*  Yeah, I had friends there from touring and stuff. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=660.5s)]
*  And so that was kind of my my foothold for moving there. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=662.5400000000001s)]
*  Like dinner, play music like I brought some equipment over. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=667.9s)]
*  Like initially I went over with like a backpack and that was it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=671.62s)]
*  And I had a friend of mine's band who were on tour pick me up at JFK and drive me into [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=677.98s)]
*  the city. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=683.3000000000001s)]
*  I still remember this like the day before, like I was doing different kind of work to [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=685.3000000000001s)]
*  save money for the move. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=689.94s)]
*  So the day before I flew to New York, I was like bucking bales of hay and like a hay field, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=692.0200000000001s)]
*  like farm stuff, right? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=698.7800000000001s)]
*  And my buddy Spike, who I'm still good friends with, played in this band called Mind Over [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=702.3s)]
*  Four. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=706.54s)]
*  They picked me up at JFK. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=707.54s)]
*  And I remember sitting in the van and looking at my converse and like I still had like straw [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=709.06s)]
*  stuck in the converse from baling hay the day before. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=715.3399999999999s)]
*  It was like, OK, this is here we go. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=717.8199999999999s)]
*  That's an adventure. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=720.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=721.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=722.62s)]
*  So you're there for a few years living that life. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=723.62s)]
*  And how do you transition into that? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=726.3s)]
*  So I went back to Seattle at some point during the first year in New York to ship more of [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=728.42s)]
*  my personal belongings over. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=735.42s)]
*  And actually I went to Sub Pop because they had they had UPS shipping there. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=737.8199999999999s)]
*  And I'm like boxing up my stuff in the Sub Pop offices and like getting ready to ship [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=743.06s)]
*  to New York, like including like a Marshall cabinet, like some music gear. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=746.9399999999999s)]
*  But I had this vague notion of, maybe I'll play there. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=751.6999999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I probably didn't touch a bass or a guitar for like the first year after getting [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=755.54s)]
*  fired from Soundgarden. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=762.5s)]
*  It just still kind of had a bad taste in my mouth. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=763.86s)]
*  But what changed that was summer of 91, maybe. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=768.9s)]
*  I was friends with this band called Skunk. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=776.62s)]
*  There's indie rock band on twin tone records. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=779.9s)]
*  There are three Mats, Matt Sweeney, Matt Quigley, and Matt Coleman. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=785.1s)]
*  So Matt Quigley, the bass player quit right before a European tour that they had booked [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=789.1s)]
*  supporting Babes in Toyland, another amazing band. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=795.1s)]
*  And so I get a call from Matt Sweeney and he's like, hey dude, like Quigley quit. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=800.0600000000001s)]
*  We got this tour coming up. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=805.22s)]
*  Do you want to fill on bass for this tour? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=806.7s)]
*  So I'm like, I could work in this warehouse in New York, like in the sweltering, you know, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=811.02s)]
*  New York summer heat, or I could, you know, go to Europe for eight weeks or whatever and [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=815.62s)]
*  tour. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=820.86s)]
*  So I'm like, yeah, okay, I'll do it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=822.14s)]
*  So learn the songs and did that tour. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=824.0600000000001s)]
*  And to this day, it was the funnest tour I'd ever done. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=828.38s)]
*  And I think that was because I really had nothing emotionally invested in the band. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=833.66s)]
*  I like the music, I like the dudes, but it's just, all I had to do was go out and play [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=840.38s)]
*  to the best of my ability. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=848.26s)]
*  And yeah, it was just fun. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=849.78s)]
*  There was no burden, no heaviness to it, you know? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=852.0999999999999s)]
*  Like being a part of Soundgarden, this immense band. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=855.18s)]
*  Yeah, that I was emotionally invested in, you know? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=859.3399999999999s)]
*  And so how do you go from that to... [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=864.38s)]
*  There's more to the story. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=869.9399999999999s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=870.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=871.9399999999999s)]
*  So I did the European tour with Skunk, and honestly, I think to this day, the best bass [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=872.9399999999999s)]
*  performances I ever did. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=880.18s)]
*  You know, I got some board recordings from that tour that once in a while I'll listen [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=882.6199999999999s)]
*  to it and go, yeah, you know, it's not bad. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=886.3s)]
*  Do you think it's because you were free, because you didn't have pressure and burden? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=890.4799999999999s)]
*  I think that was a component for sure, but also the songs were a bit more complicated, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=894.98s)]
*  and stylistically, it wasn't necessarily my jam. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=900.8199999999999s)]
*  I was into heavier stuff, and this is kind of more like soul asylum, like indie rock, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=904.8199999999999s)]
*  which is great. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=909.4599999999999s)]
*  And the bass parts were really complicated, so I kind of had to push myself to learn them. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=911.06s)]
*  And again, like, you know, grew from it as a musician. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=915.9399999999999s)]
*  So I did the tour, came back, I started playing with this kind of an industrial band on Earek [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=924.2199999999999s)]
*  Records called Old Lady Drivers, which is like another kind of interesting foray into [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=930.3399999999999s)]
*  a genre that... [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=935.42s)]
*  Like I was a fan of like the grindcore bands for sure, but like even this was like, it's [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=937.54s)]
*  kind of beyond that because it's a lot of synthesizers and drum machines and stuff that [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=942.9799999999999s)]
*  I really wasn't exposed to before. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=950.14s)]
*  They had a record deal with Earek, and you know who John Zorn is? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=952.94s)]
*  No. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=957.14s)]
*  So he's an American treasure, he's this avant-garde jazz musician based out of New York. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=958.14s)]
*  Google him if you get a chance, but like brilliant. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=965.06s)]
*  Kind of, he does a lot of stuff, he's really prolific. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=969.82s)]
*  Definitely a genius. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=974.74s)]
*  But so Zorn was on board, he produced the record, and John actually lived in my neighborhood, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=975.74s)]
*  so I'd like go to his apartment, he lived like two blocks away in Alphabet City, and [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=981.82s)]
*  he had this insane record collection. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=985.9000000000001s)]
*  Like the whole flat was like shells of vinyl, and it was all organized very meticulously, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=988.2600000000001s)]
*  plastic sleeves for each jacket. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=996.4200000000001s)]
*  It was... [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=999.3000000000001s)]
*  And he was like a student of American music, or music in general, and he got his knowledge. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1000.7800000000001s)]
*  And it was just cool, like, oh. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1008.1s)]
*  So here's this guy, at least on a kind of underground level, like very well known, very [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1011.0999999999999s)]
*  well respected, like huge in Japan of course. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1019.8599999999999s)]
*  And he's just like this nice kind of normal dude, like giving me a tour of his record [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1024.7s)]
*  collection, you know. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1029.6599999999999s)]
*  And we're both living in this shitty neighborhood in Manhattan. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1030.6599999999999s)]
*  This is cool. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1034.34s)]
*  So that was a good experience. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1035.74s)]
*  I played shows with him, like played CBs again, CBGBs, which is the legendary punk club in [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1036.78s)]
*  New York, which even having played there before, but it's just kind of like, I would still [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1044.82s)]
*  get excited about it. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1051.82s)]
*  It's like, dude, I'm playing CBGBs. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1052.82s)]
*  It's like this mythical place when I was a teenager, you know, and it's like, oh, here [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1055.6200000000001s)]
*  I am. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1060.18s)]
*  So I did that, but that was kind of like just a side thing for sure. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1061.54s)]
*  And then I got contacted. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1068.42s)]
*  So going back between the Skunk Tour and the Old Lady Driver's Experience, I kind of got [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1071.74s)]
*  into playing music again. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1077.6599999999999s)]
*  Like, it became fun again, which is why I did it in the first place. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1079.1399999999999s)]
*  Like, it brought me joy. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1084.74s)]
*  There was a couple of times where it got to the point where the joy was fully extracted [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1088.1399999999999s)]
*  from the process and it just, it wasn't fulfilling anymore, you know. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1092.3s)]
*  So anyway, I'm back in New York working in the warehouse, doing my thing, and I get contacted [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1099.26s)]
*  by, you ever heard of Uniform Choice? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1104.78s)]
*  No. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1107.1s)]
*  Like a hardcore band from LA from the 80s. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1108.1s)]
*  I get contacted by Pat Dubar, who was in the 80s a singer for Uniform Choice, and that [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1112.34s)]
*  was a band I was familiar with from the punk days and everything. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1118.02s)]
*  So he was in this band called Mindfunk, which first off, like horrible name, like get it. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1121.86s)]
*  We can go into that later. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1131.3s)]
*  But Pat contacts me and he's like, hey, and they were signed to Epic Records, had one [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1132.62s)]
*  record out already. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1139.26s)]
*  And he's like, hey, we're going to replace one of our guitar players and our drummer. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1140.26s)]
*  It's like, are you interested in trying out? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1146.78s)]
*  And honestly, I hadn't heard their record and I gave the first one a listen and honestly [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1150.66s)]
*  wasn't that excited about it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1155.62s)]
*  But it was, it was kind of like at this point in my life, it's like, I kind of knew like [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1158.42s)]
*  If I'm going to give the music thing another go, like this is, this is going to be it. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1165.9s)]
*  You know, it's like, do this and it'll either catch fire or it won't. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1170.9s)]
*  And if it doesn't, I'll go on to the next chapter, whatever that is. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1176.1000000000001s)]
*  And so I can't, I can't, I don't even think I auditioned for the band. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1180.78s)]
*  I think they just, okay, you're in. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1186.5800000000002s)]
*  So now we're looking for a drummer. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1190.2s)]
*  So I went and poached my friend Sean back home in Washington, who played in a band that [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1193.56s)]
*  I was a big fan of and I was a big fan of Sean and like convinced him to like come out [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1200.32s)]
*  to New York and like join this band that, you know, he'd never heard of. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1206.04s)]
*  And it took a lot of convincing to get him to do it, but he did it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1210.76s)]
*  And so this kind of mindfunk 2.0 with Sean and I, one plus side was like, okay, major [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1214.72s)]
*  label get put on salary, like don't need a day job anymore. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1226.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1230.7s)]
*  So once again, I'm a professional rock musician, which not that I care about the title, but [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1231.7s)]
*  it was nice not to have the day job. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1236.78s)]
*  So we get a house in Monmouth County, New Jersey in order to write the next record. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1240.24s)]
*  So band house, five of us living in this house. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1246.32s)]
*  And it was just, it was routine. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1250.6s)]
*  Like we'd get together every day, rehearse, write songs. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1254.22s)]
*  I was given more or less full creative reign for my ideas and stuff, which was fulfilling [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1258.44s)]
*  on that level. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1265.9s)]
*  The band was managed by John Zazzola. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1269.72s)]
*  Do you know who he is? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1272.32s)]
*  Johnny Z. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1274.0s)]
*  No. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1275.0s)]
*  So he was like the dude who discovered Metallica. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1276.0s)]
*  That's kind of his claim to fame. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1277.52s)]
*  And he had a label called Megaforce Records, which great 80s movie by the way, if you've [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1279.56s)]
*  never seen it. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1285.24s)]
*  No. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1286.24s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1287.24s)]
*  It's about the band? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1288.24s)]
*  No. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1289.24s)]
*  About the band? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1290.24s)]
*  It's this horrible yet brilliant action movie from like 1982, I think. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1291.24s)]
*  But it's a digression. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1293.92s)]
*  So John and Marcia had this management company, Crazed Management. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1296.68s)]
*  They owned Megaforce Records and that's the label that put out Kill em All and the first [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1301.8200000000002s)]
*  pressing of Ride the Lightning. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1306.2s)]
*  And they did Merciful Fate Melissa. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1308.42s)]
*  They did some really good records, like the first Anthrax records as well, I think. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1310.64s)]
*  So John managed some pretty big bands. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1316.5s)]
*  He managed Anthrax, Suicidal Tendencies, Ministry I think. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1321.0s)]
*  Like he was this kind of known quantity in the music world, or at least in the heavy [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1327.76s)]
*  metal world, hard rock world, whatever you want to call it. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1333.28s)]
*  So we had Johnny Z signed to Epic, had the house in Jersey, writing the record. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1337.4s)]
*  Like with the name Mindfunk, which again is like a dumb name, it kind of turned me off [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1347.2s)]
*  initially. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1351.6000000000001s)]
*  So I suggested like making it one word, like contracting it to make it a little less odious. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1353.18s)]
*  So I did that, kind of changed the logo. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1359.48s)]
*  So it's kind of slipping in some aesthetic values that I thought were better at least [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1364.2s)]
*  in what was going on at the time. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1370.4s)]
*  Why do you hate Mindfunk so much? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1372.44s)]
*  It's just a dumb name. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1374.28s)]
*  You know? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1375.28s)]
*  The whole funk thing. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1376.36s)]
*  It's like, oh, what? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1377.36s)]
*  Chili Peppers, like what? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1378.36s)]
*  No, it wasn't like that at all. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1379.36s)]
*  You know? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1380.96s)]
*  But you know, there's a lot of dumb band names out there. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1381.96s)]
*  And if the band catches fire, it doesn't matter if it's a dumb name. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1386.44s)]
*  It just gets accepted. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1390.44s)]
*  So that's not that big a deal. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1391.76s)]
*  So recording, blah, blah, blah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1397.6399999999999s)]
*  Johnny Z. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1400.6399999999999s)]
*  So we get Terry Date, the producer, on board to produce the second record. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1402.0s)]
*  And he's from Seattle, so I knew him from Soundgarden and from other local bands that [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1408.68s)]
*  he produced, like a known quantity in that world. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1413.6000000000001s)]
*  We book out Bearsville Studio up in Woodstock, New York. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1419.3200000000002s)]
*  Those studios are literally on this old Dutch farm. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1425.0s)]
*  It's like idyllic. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1429.44s)]
*  So we get Bearsville booked out for three months, got Terry Date on board. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1432.52s)]
*  It's like September of 90... [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1438.52s)]
*  Let's be September 92. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1441.52s)]
*  We pack up the U-Haul, all the gear, drive up to Bearsville to start the next record. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1446.46s)]
*  So Sean and I are in the barn setting up equipment on this farm to start the pre-production [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1454.6599999999999s)]
*  work. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1461.5s)]
*  Like, I don't know, it's probably a Saturday. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1462.5s)]
*  Or no, it was a Friday. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1464.5s)]
*  It was definitely a Friday. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1465.5s)]
*  So we're setting up the equipment to start pre-production work when Terry gets in. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1467.86s)]
*  And I think Pat came down to the barn as we're setting up. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1472.3799999999999s)]
*  And it's this late September, you know, the heat has kind of left like New York State. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1477.62s)]
*  So it's pleasant outside. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1484.5s)]
*  It's beautiful, sunny, farm, you know, this old barn we're setting up equipment in. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1485.5s)]
*  And Pat says, hey, we got to get everyone together. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1492.3799999999999s)]
*  We've got some bad news. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1498.1799999999998s)]
*  So Epic, the label, had dropped the band like that day. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1501.1799999999998s)]
*  Like catastrophic, right? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1508.1399999999999s)]
*  Or could have been catastrophic. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1511.1399999999999s)]
*  And just the fact that it was like a Friday afternoon, I'm sure it was like a post-it [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1513.62s)]
*  note on some dude at Epic's computer monitor, drop mindfuck. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1517.58s)]
*  It's like, oh shit, I got to do that. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1522.62s)]
*  So it's like, fuck, you know, it's like a $300,000 recording budget. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1526.22s)]
*  Terry Dade is producer. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1532.86s)]
*  Like the band's literally homeless. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1535.58s)]
*  Like we're going to live at the studio. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1537.86s)]
*  But it's like, OK, what now? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1539.3799999999999s)]
*  So the dude who managed Bairdsville, and I can't remember his name, he's this British [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1541.32s)]
*  guy, super sweet. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1545.56s)]
*  And he's like, he saw we're in a tight spot. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1547.52s)]
*  He's like, you know, he's out like a huge lump of money, right? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1550.76s)]
*  Because that studio was booked out for three months. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1557.0s)]
*  That's like a huge, you know, quarter million dollars probably. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1558.96s)]
*  He's like, you guys can stay here and sort out what you got to sort out kind of thing. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1563.32s)]
*  So I remember Pat and I were living in one of the cottages on the property. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1570.68s)]
*  It was like this very quaint little farmhouse. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1576.28s)]
*  And like, you know, at least I won't speak for everyone, but I was in it days. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1580.3600000000001s)]
*  I was like, fuck, you know, I was like already like lining up, getting my warehouse job back, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1583.8400000000001s)]
*  like all this stuff. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1592.0800000000002s)]
*  And so I remember just like staying in this house, sleeping on this antique leather sofa, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1594.0s)]
*  and I have my cat with me. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1599.08s)]
*  So it's me and my cat watching bad daytime TV. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1600.84s)]
*  I think I lived on like Cheerios and like soda, like just nasty, right? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1604.24s)]
*  Just because I was too lazy to go go to a restaurant or buy food to cook or just like, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1610.12s)]
*  it's easy bowl of cereal and some soda. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1615.04s)]
*  Like this just sounds so gross now. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1617.44s)]
*  Even then, like that's not how I normally ate. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1619.72s)]
*  During that period, that's what I was eating. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1621.84s)]
*  So I was watching bad daytime television. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1624.24s)]
*  And I remember there was this wall hanging in the room, in the living room, and it was [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1628.72s)]
*  this macrame like koala bear, you know, kind of tacky. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1633.76s)]
*  And I kind of started obsessing on this macrame koala bear to the point where it's like, if [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1640.92s)]
*  I ever have a daughter, I'm going to name her koala macrame. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1646.48s)]
*  You know, again, dumb, speaking of dumb names. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1651.72s)]
*  Luckily that passed and I came up with a replacement for a daughter's name that was much better. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1656.32s)]
*  But so during that week, Johnny Z, our manager who personally, I didn't really like him that [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1662.84s)]
*  much, you know, he was kind of he's a there was something kind of dodgy about him, like [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1673.72s)]
*  in that music business way that also put a bad taste in my mouth on a lot of levels, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1680.44s)]
*  just being in that that industry. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1687.52s)]
*  But Johnny, you know, as much as I didn't like him, he came through and maybe he was [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1691.76s)]
*  motivated by economic reasons rather than, you know, he's being a stand up guy or whatever. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1695.1200000000001s)]
*  He signed the band to Megaforce to his label, put up the money for the recording to record [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1701.76s)]
*  the record, put us all back on salary so didn't miss a beat like no one had to get a day job. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1711.48s)]
*  And then Terry, Terry Date, much to his credit, like he had every right to bail, right? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1717.8400000000001s)]
*  It was like, okay, what's the next gig? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1724.28s)]
*  Okay, I'm there. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1727.8s)]
*  He got us studio time at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, which is Hart's old recording [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1729.18s)]
*  studio. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1734.44s)]
*  It's gone now. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1735.44s)]
*  Like all this happened in like a week, 10 days. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1736.44s)]
*  Like everything was back on track, just like new label, new studio in Seattle. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1741.18s)]
*  And so loaded up the gear, flew to Seattle and like probably 10 days later, we're doing [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1747.3400000000001s)]
*  pre-production demos at Bad Animals and recorded the record. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1752.28s)]
*  And it was done, I think, by December, the mix was done. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1757.42s)]
*  I actually went back to New York and worked in the warehouse for a month to make some [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1763.86s)]
*  extra money. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1768.48s)]
*  And then the band, well, not the whole band, but Sean, Pat and I decided to move to San [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1770.58s)]
*  Francisco just for like a change of venue. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1776.3999999999999s)]
*  So I think New Year's Day or the day after, I loaded up U-Haul with all our stuff and [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1780.44s)]
*  like drove cross country by myself, which was like a super fun road trip. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1785.8400000000001s)]
*  And then we got an apartment in the Mission District in San Francisco. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1790.92s)]
*  And that's where like 1993 was a very transitional year. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1794.94s)]
*  And that's where it kind of things got to the point where it's like, okay, I got to [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1800.04s)]
*  do something different for me personally. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1806.04s)]
*  And what happens next? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1810.76s)]
*  So we're living in San Francisco like that, like even while we're living in the house [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1813.3999999999999s)]
*  in New Jersey during the recording process in Seattle and in San Francisco, like taking [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1820.3s)]
*  a lot of drugs, like a lot of who listen to Jins mostly. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1828.5s)]
*  But you know, had my flirtation with heroin like first started just smoking it, you know, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1832.12s)]
*  on tin foil and then went into IV use. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1837.8799999999999s)]
*  And like I honestly enjoyed it, but it never got its hooks in me. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1842.0s)]
*  And I got to the point where I was like, yeah, I should probably not continue down this path [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1845.48s)]
*  and walked away from it. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1851.84s)]
*  It's a big step to go to intravenous. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1854.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1857.0s)]
*  Well, like I'm a completist, I guess. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1858.0s)]
*  It's like I don't want to do it halfway. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1860.68s)]
*  See what the fuss is all about. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1863.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1864.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1865.5600000000002s)]
*  What is the fuss all about? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1866.5600000000002s)]
*  So the feeling, what's your experience with opiates? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1868.64s)]
*  Only like while I've been under like having surgery. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1873.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so it's the same. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1877.0800000000002s)]
*  Just that kind of weightless feeling. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1879.1200000000001s)]
*  It's very nice. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1880.3200000000002s)]
*  Like it's I guess the analogy I can make is just that kind of post orgasmic bliss where [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1881.5600000000002s)]
*  you're weightless and everything feels wonderful. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1888.0s)]
*  It's like that, you know, but induced artificially, I guess. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1891.04s)]
*  Living in San Francisco. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1901.64s)]
*  So we toured a lot that year, probably half the year was touring like Europe and the States. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1902.64s)]
*  And then when we're back in San Francisco, it was like, you know, still on salary, you [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1908.52s)]
*  didn't have to work. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1913.4s)]
*  So just hang out and like, you know, drop acid or drink mushroom tea or whatever. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1914.6000000000001s)]
*  And as fun as that is, it was like, like long term, I don't know, you know, if this is going [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1921.2800000000002s)]
*  to be right. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1928.6000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, the record never caught fire. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1929.6000000000001s)]
*  I think it's a solid record. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1931.92s)]
*  Like when I hear tracks off of it now, you know, I'm kind of like, no, it's not bad. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1933.5600000000002s)]
*  No, it's OK. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1940.1200000000001s)]
*  There's a couple of the songs on that record were basically nascent Soundgarden songs, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1944.24s)]
*  you know, there were like riffs or song ideas I had that while playing with Soundgarden, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1949.0s)]
*  like Chris would hear me playing it, like newling around and he'd be like, oh, remember [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1954.4s)]
*  that, you know. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1959.32s)]
*  And so I had a couple ideas in a different life would have been on the next Soundgarden [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1960.32s)]
*  record conceivably. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1967.08s)]
*  So there's a couple of those songs on there. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1969.36s)]
*  Not a bad record. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1972.56s)]
*  And we did play like a bunch of the big festivals in Europe. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1973.84s)]
*  Like we did pretty much everything but make a bunch of money, you know, which is again, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1978.1999999999998s)]
*  most bands, you know, most bands don't catch fire. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1985.04s)]
*  To what happened? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1991.3999999999999s)]
*  So during this period, 1993, I started, I guess, crafting the next chapter, right, for [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=1993.26s)]
*  me. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2003.78s)]
*  And I'd always been really intrigued by the military. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2005.22s)]
*  My grandfather, both my grandfathers were World War II vets. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2009.06s)]
*  So my maternal grandfather was a tank commander in World War II. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2015.46s)]
*  He was kind of my introduction to like military stuff, you know, and I'm a little kid so I'm [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2021.46s)]
*  intrigued by it. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2028.1s)]
*  Like, you know, tank commander, that's cool. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2029.1s)]
*  Like he, on D-Day, he was an E4 corporal, like gunner on a Sherman tank. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2031.86s)]
*  On VE Day, his unit had made it all the way to Vienna and he was a company commander. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2038.54s)]
*  And it was just survival, like attrition. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2044.86s)]
*  You know, I'm sure he was a fine soldier but it was just attrition that he went from corporal [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2048.7s)]
*  to captain in, you know, a year or whatever. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2053.06s)]
*  My grandmother's second husband was a corpsman in the Navy so his story is super funny. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2059.7s)]
*  Like he grew up in a small town on the Columbia River in Washington State. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2068.18s)]
*  So his, I think there was like 20 dudes in his graduating class in high school and so [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2072.6s)]
*  they graduated June 1942. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2077.78s)]
*  So right after graduation, like 201, like every male in his class went to the recruiter [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2081.42s)]
*  and enlisted. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2087.1400000000003s)]
*  And so he went in the Navy. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2088.6800000000003s)]
*  His Navy MOS was like a pharmacist made or something like that. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2091.42s)]
*  So he's like, oh, I'll be on the ship like working in the dispensary or whatever. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2096.86s)]
*  Like wrong. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2101.5400000000004s)]
*  Like he graduates. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2102.5400000000004s)]
*  Like they give him a helmet and attach him to a Marine platoon, infantry platoon, and [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2103.94s)]
*  like you're the medic. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2108.58s)]
*  And so he did like seven amphibious assaults in the Pacific. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2110.5s)]
*  Like crazy stuff, right? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2114.18s)]
*  Yeah, like super hard. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2117.18s)]
*  And he had amazing stories, you know. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2119.42s)]
*  And then my father's father was in the Coast Guard and he did a lot of coastal patrolling, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2122.82s)]
*  Oregon Coast, Washington Coast, Columbia River during the war. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2129.46s)]
*  Just you know, looking for Japanese subs or whatever. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2133.7400000000002s)]
*  And so you, because you had this sort of wanderlust that made you want to go trek in the Himalayas [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2137.54s)]
*  and you had this family, this background in the military, you were thinking that this [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2143.38s)]
*  would be something that would be adventurous or intriguing to you? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2149.66s)]
*  Yeah, like I've always had a taste for like high adventure, like as a child, like before, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2154.5s)]
*  probably even before I was school. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2163.78s)]
*  So like Saturday morning cartoons, like how old are you? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2164.94s)]
*  55. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2168.3s)]
*  Yeah, we're same age. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2169.3s)]
*  So I imagine probably grew up with similar cultural influences. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2170.3s)]
*  So I remember in the mornings watching TV shows, like cartoons, like Johnny Quest was [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2174.7s)]
*  the big one, right? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2180.3s)]
*  Speed Racer, Marine Boy. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2182.26s)]
*  Like all this, you know, Speed Racer and Marine Boy were animated, but they were like great. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2184.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, Marine Boy was basically Speed Racer, but underwater. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2189.02s)]
*  You know, it's just super cool, fantastical stuff. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2192.3399999999997s)]
*  Great to feed the imagination. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2196.7s)]
*  Like the writing for Johnny Quest was so good, you know? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2198.54s)]
*  And like the show in retrospect was like kind of progressive. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2202.22s)]
*  It was like Johnny had two dads. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2205.8599999999997s)]
*  And like they had this like multiracial like composite family. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2208.86s)]
*  But the writing was so solid, like super creative. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2217.2200000000003s)]
*  I think it was only 26 episodes, but each episode is distinct and well written and just [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2222.42s)]
*  cool, you know? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2227.86s)]
*  So I would watch this as a kid and be like, I'm not sure what that is, but I want to do [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2228.94s)]
*  that. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2235.06s)]
*  So that was kind of the initial impetus for like... [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2236.86s)]
*  And then growing up in the woods in Western Washington, I was expected, you know, I was [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2239.6200000000003s)]
*  kicked outside after breakfast and not expected to be seen again until dinnertime. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2245.5s)]
*  And what I did between then was like on me. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2250.5s)]
*  And so I'd go out and do stupid stuff, like climb high tension power lines, you know, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2252.86s)]
*  to the top, like five, six years old. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2258.26s)]
*  Like so stupid, right? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2260.6600000000003s)]
*  But it was like, oh, this is cool. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2263.58s)]
*  Like, and my mother, she definitely facilitated this stuff, like much to her credit. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2266.5s)]
*  Like we'd go camping in the Olympic rainforest on the peninsula. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2275.58s)]
*  And there's like a couple rivers there, but one of the main ones is the Ho River. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2280.58s)]
*  And I had this, as a child, I had like this $20, you know, Kmart inflatable raft with [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2285.34s)]
*  the oars. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2291.5s)]
*  And my mom would drive me upriver, like 10 miles or 15 miles or whatever, in our Volkswagen [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2293.18s)]
*  bus and like drop me off, me and my $20 Kmart boat in a life vest. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2299.54s)]
*  And she'd be like, all right, see you at the campground. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2308.66s)]
*  And so I would be doing this like, you know, white water rafting by myself in my cheesy [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2311.22s)]
*  little boat for several, several miles and, you know, didn't drown, obviously. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2316.78s)]
*  So it kind of instilled again this, it reinforced this sense of adventure, you know. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2322.86s)]
*  And I'm sure my mom would go to jail for that today. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2328.3s)]
*  Probably not jail, but definitely be discouraged. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2333.1s)]
*  So that's background for the high adventure thing, the military thing. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2340.06s)]
*  So 1993, I'm like, okay, I need to do something. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2343.1s)]
*  I need that punctuated equilibrium, right? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2354.06s)]
*  I need a dramatic event in order to promulgate like the next period of growth or evolution [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2356.86s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2364.14s)]
*  So you really actively thought that way? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2364.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2366.7s)]
*  You were trying to achieve growth. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2367.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2369.8199999999997s)]
*  I didn't want to stagnate. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2370.06s)]
*  I didn't want to fall behind, you know. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2371.54s)]
*  As like, I guess as soon as I figured out what life authorship was or the concept, even [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2377.5s)]
*  though I may have not have known the term. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2385.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2389.54s)]
*  I kind of endeavored to actively author my own life. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2389.78s)]
*  You know, pursuing the ends of making a life that kept me engaged, kept me interested. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2395.9s)]
*  And was meaningful to me, you know. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2402.38s)]
*  So the military seemed like more and more like a viable option for that next page, that [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2405.38s)]
*  next step. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2413.2200000000003s)]
*  So at the time, like 1993, there wasn't a lot of books out about special operations. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2414.98s)]
*  And pretty much the only ones that were out there were like Vietnam dudes. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2421.82s)]
*  So I devoured every, you know, Vietnam War special operations book, whether it was like [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2426.26s)]
*  Lerps, Rangers, Seals, SF, whatever. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2432.62s)]
*  Had Dick Marcinko written his books yet? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2435.62s)]
*  That I don't know. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2438.7s)]
*  I don't think so, because I think I would have remembered reading them. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2441.94s)]
*  I read one of them when I was in Gulag in Ranger school. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2445.86s)]
*  And it seemed kind of like over the top to me. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2450.2200000000003s)]
*  But that's a digression. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2457.3s)]
*  I think there was one book out about like the SOF experience during the first Gulf War. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2459.1800000000003s)]
*  And it kind of went over different units and different operations. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2465.06s)]
*  And I think that's the only kind of contemporary one that was even out. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2468.1800000000003s)]
*  But it's like, yeah, yeah, I'm going to do this. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2473.1000000000004s)]
*  So while we're in San Francisco, you know, between like dropping acid and taking mushrooms, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2474.62s)]
*  I was going to the recruiter and like I went to the Navy recruiter first because I actually knew [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2482.18s)]
*  someone who was a seal, a former seal. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2487.9s)]
*  And so that seemed intriguing to me. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2491.14s)]
*  So I go to the Navy recruiter and I'm like, hey, I want to I want to be a seal. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2493.06s)]
*  And they're like, well, here, take the ASVAB. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2498.2599999999998s)]
*  So the ASVAB is like this IQ test that the military gives you. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2502.58s)]
*  And so I took it and I scored pretty high on it. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2506.34s)]
*  And so they're trying to push me into like more technical MOS, you know, and I'm like, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2511.98s)]
*  but no, that's not what I want. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2518.38s)]
*  What does MOS stand for? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2519.66s)]
*  Oh, sorry. If I get too jargony, that's OK. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2520.5s)]
*  Please stop me. Yeah. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2523.5s)]
*  Military Occupational Specialty, your job. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2524.98s)]
*  And the Navy doesn't even call it MOS. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2528.86s)]
*  I think they call it rate or something like that. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2531.26s)]
*  And so I'm like, no, I don't want to do that. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2534.3s)]
*  So basically it came down to they couldn't even promise me a shot at at trying out for Buds, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2537.82s)]
*  you know, take taking the test basically. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2546.6600000000003s)]
*  And so I didn't know really anything about the military, but I knew enough or I suspected [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2550.3s)]
*  enough that like, OK, I'm not I'm not going to sign anything unless I'm like guaranteed a shot. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2556.14s)]
*  And so that's when I started talking to the armory recruiter and they could guarantee me. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2562.58s)]
*  So basically they gave me a Ranger contract. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2569.18s)]
*  So Ranger Regiment's interesting in that it's pretty much the only special operations unit [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2573.02s)]
*  in the U.S. military that has has privates, like has brand new soldiers. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2578.86s)]
*  Pretty much every other unit, it's all NCOs. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2583.7s)]
*  So that's kind of that's kind of your entry level soft unit in the U.S. military is Ranger Regiment. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2587.46s)]
*  And so what happens? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2594.9399999999996s)]
*  So I finished my mindfunk touring obligations, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2598.62s)]
*  which went pretty much almost up until Christmas, like in mid-December, say. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2604.06s)]
*  And. Like left the band [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2611.46s)]
*  and I think two months later I was in basic training. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2617.14s)]
*  What were you thinking while you were in basic training? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2621.98s)]
*  I mean, basic training is like. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2624.82s)]
*  It was like every movie cliche you've seen like happens. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2629.94s)]
*  It's like, oh, and this is, you know, this part. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2634.38s)]
*  It was. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2638.7s)]
*  It was a necessary step, right, for the progression. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2642.4199999999996s)]
*  It wasn't really challenging other. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2646.66s)]
*  The most challenging part about it was like not being able to do what I wanted to do whenever I wanted to do it. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2648.74s)]
*  That was like the biggest challenge for me. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2655.2999999999997s)]
*  Your entire life, every minute of your day is controlled. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2657.8599999999997s)]
*  So that was kind of like, I don't know if I dig this. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2662.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I dig this. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2665.7s)]
*  Right. And but, you know, sucked it up, went through it. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2667.8199999999997s)]
*  After what they call AIT, like Advanced Individual Training, which for me was infantry. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2673.8599999999997s)]
*  You go through the infantry MOS training, go to airborne school and then go to selection for regiment. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2681.5s)]
*  So was what was the physical aspect of it like? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2689.8599999999997s)]
*  Because it seemed like you're just partying and living life, you know, like a rock star before that. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2693.06s)]
*  You just doing heroin and all this stuff. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2698.7400000000002s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, you know, you're involved in something that's very physically grueling. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2701.06s)]
*  But I did I did prep like I got a YMCA membership and I was swimming at the Y. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2706.5s)]
*  I was running. I was. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2712.82s)]
*  Even though I was kind of going into it somewhat blind, I didn't know. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2716.34s)]
*  I knew that like I can't just show up like and not have any kind of fitness level, you know. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2720.1s)]
*  So I did do some prep work and I think it served me well. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2726.2599999999998s)]
*  Was that the first time you had done physical stuff like that in your life? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2729.7s)]
*  No, I mean, I was never I played soccer when I was a kid. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2732.98s)]
*  Like the soccer was like the the one sport that wasn't didn't have that jock culture, you know. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2738.86s)]
*  So that's kind of what I gravitated towards. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2746.98s)]
*  So I mean, you know, I did a lot of physical outside stuff like my whole life. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2749.3799999999997s)]
*  You know, I worked in Alaska on a fishing boat like there was nothing. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2753.8199999999997s)]
*  It wasn't foreign, you know, like physical exertion. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2759.58s)]
*  And so what happens then? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2764.14s)]
*  Go to selection at the time, it was called RIP, like the Ranger indoctrination program. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2769.18s)]
*  Now they call it RASP, like the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program, something like that. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2775.7400000000002s)]
*  And I think it's a week longer now. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2782.26s)]
*  But like like RIP is when things got physically challenging, for sure. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2784.7400000000002s)]
*  It was basically you just get abused for three weeks, basically. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2790.9s)]
*  You know, they try to make you quit. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2793.98s)]
*  And so like the runs like we do these like nonstandard runs and RIP, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2796.02s)]
*  that was it pushed pushed me to my limits, like [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2801.02s)]
*  I was always kind of at the back of the pack. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2804.78s)]
*  Like I was still with the main body. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2809.26s)]
*  So I was I was keeping up. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2810.6200000000003s)]
*  I was meeting the standard. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2812.1000000000004s)]
*  But like right behind me were like all the dudes who were like getting [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2813.78s)]
*  put on the truck like you're done, you know. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2818.1000000000004s)]
*  So it's like you look at that and like [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2821.0600000000004s)]
*  dig a little deeper and like, keep going, you know. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2823.82s)]
*  But yeah, I got got selected [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2827.6200000000003s)]
*  and went to second Ranger Battalion. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2831.3s)]
*  And did you immediately get deployed? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2834.82s)]
*  Like what what year are we talking about here? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2837.5800000000004s)]
*  This was 93, no, 94. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2839.6200000000003s)]
*  OK, so this is post Desert Storm. Yeah. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2842.02s)]
*  What was the environment like? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2845.5800000000004s)]
*  So it was like it was Clinton era military, peacetime military. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2848.1000000000004s)]
*  So like everything was geared towards training, right? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2853.82s)]
*  Like there was a few dudes in my company who were like Panama vets. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2858.42s)]
*  And so that was like 1989, I think. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2864.02s)]
*  Just cause. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2868.02s)]
*  So there's some of those dudes hanging out. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2869.3s)]
*  And I could tell they were just waiting for the next like real world up. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2871.86s)]
*  That's all they were doing. They're biding time. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2875.6200000000003s)]
*  And like now I get it. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2878.26s)]
*  And I think even then I kind of got it. But [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2880.34s)]
*  just trying to get it. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2884.82s)]
*  Like, you know, that's you want to do it for real. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2887.1000000000004s)]
*  You still want to train all the time. Right. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2890.7000000000003s)]
*  So. Yeah, it's just a lot of training. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2893.5800000000004s)]
*  There was deployments, but it's just all training deployments. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2898.98s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I went to Ranger school, like got my Ranger tab. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2903.7400000000002s)]
*  And what happens after that? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2910.5800000000004s)]
*  I finished my enlistment as like a four year enlistment, I think. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2914.42s)]
*  And then I got out because it was like. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2918.26s)]
*  In a way, I kind of thought like I achieved what I aim to achieve [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2920.7799999999997s)]
*  by going in the military, and there definitely, you know, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2925.1s)]
*  wasn't a war on the horizon, at least one that no one that anyone could see. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2928.7s)]
*  So I had a break in service for a couple of years. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2936.9s)]
*  And I kind of fucked off. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2940.02s)]
*  Ended up going. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2945.82s)]
*  To Community College, which is like another kind of funny story. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2947.18s)]
*  If you're interested. Sure. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2953.18s)]
*  So I came back to Washington, basically, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2955.18s)]
*  when my when my mother died. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2960.2999999999997s)]
*  And so I was kind of like dealing with with her and her stuff. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2962.8199999999997s)]
*  And it was like. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2969.62s)]
*  There's a local community college where I grew up. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2971.4199999999996s)]
*  And like, maybe maybe I'll give this college thing a try, you know? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2974.7799999999997s)]
*  And so I registered for some classes. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2978.8999999999996s)]
*  But the funny thing about that story is. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2981.8599999999997s)]
*  When I was like 18, I guess, 17, like right before I graduated high school. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2986.9799999999996s)]
*  All my friends from high school who were going to go to college, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2994.18s)]
*  because like in my mind, I was never going to go. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=2998.7s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to go to college. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3000.7799999999997s)]
*  Because like in my mind, I was never going to go. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3002.34s)]
*  I was like, why am I going to go to college? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3004.42s)]
*  Like, fuck this, you know, is, you know, angry young man, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3007.1800000000003s)]
*  dissatisfied on pretty much every level. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3010.98s)]
*  But I was like, yeah, I'm not going to college. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3013.46s)]
*  College has nothing for me. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3016.7000000000003s)]
*  But I wanted to hang out with my friends, like the dudes I skateboarded with [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3018.5800000000004s)]
*  and played music with and stuff. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3021.7000000000003s)]
*  And so they were all going to take their SATs at the local community college, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3023.42s)]
*  like on a Saturday morning or whatever it was. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3028.5800000000004s)]
*  And so I went with them just so I could hang out with them. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3031.94s)]
*  And I took the SATs, but I took my SATs on acid. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3036.78s)]
*  How'd that go? No idea. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3041.7400000000002s)]
*  I didn't care. I never picked up, you know, the scores. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3043.82s)]
*  Like, it's probably just like making designs on the paper or something like. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3046.58s)]
*  You know, I at that point, like academia, like higher education, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3052.54s)]
*  that just wasn't going to happen for me. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3057.18s)]
*  And so, yeah, it's kind of this fuck you punk rock thing. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3059.94s)]
*  Like, I'm going to take my SATs on acid. Right. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3063.02s)]
*  So fast forward 10 years, I'm in that same room at Olympic College [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3066.38s)]
*  in a class, taking an astronomy class. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3071.2200000000003s)]
*  And the building is still there. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3076.3s)]
*  It's called the Rotunda. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3077.38s)]
*  And it's this round, as you can imagine, building on campus. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3078.38s)]
*  And yeah, so who's laughing now? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3083.2200000000003s)]
*  You know. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3086.98s)]
*  So what was your idea like doing that? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3088.5s)]
*  Taking astronomy classes, going to college? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3091.98s)]
*  Again, personal growth. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3095.94s)]
*  Like, maybe I should focus on this aspect now, like academia. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3097.38s)]
*  Like, so I did that first semester, first two semesters at Olympic College [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3101.34s)]
*  and found that I liked it. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3107.26s)]
*  You know, I like going to class and I like taking notes and I like learning. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3109.98s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, I get it now. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3114.14s)]
*  You know, this whole college thing. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3118.2200000000003s)]
*  So I finished my associates. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3120.62s)]
*  At Olympic College and then went back in the army. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3125.06s)]
*  And so I was in the special forces [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3129.2200000000003s)]
*  qualification course, like when 9-11 happened. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3132.26s)]
*  And what caused you to go back in the army? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3135.94s)]
*  It was a gut feeling. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3139.34s)]
*  It was like, I don't think I'm done with this. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3140.86s)]
*  So I went to selection, got selected [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3144.42s)]
*  and selection, at least at the time, was good for life, basically. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3149.3s)]
*  So how many years were you out? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3152.82s)]
*  Like two, two years. Yeah, not long, not long at all. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3154.38s)]
*  And, you know, I blink now and two years goes by. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3158.06s)]
*  But a lot had happened personally in those two years. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3161.6600000000003s)]
*  So I'm back back in the army [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3165.42s)]
*  doing the special forces qualification course. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3167.7400000000002s)]
*  Which for my MOS, like the 18 Bravo [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3171.26s)]
*  Special Forces Weapons Sergeant was like about a year and a half. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3174.94s)]
*  So it was the first day of language school. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3179.1s)]
*  Which was six months long. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3183.42s)]
*  Was 9-11. Wow. Yeah. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3186.1s)]
*  What was it like being in the military when 9-11 went down? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3190.3s)]
*  It was. Like, I think everyone there. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3195.1800000000003s)]
*  So we're there's a group of us in this building at Fort Bragg [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3199.06s)]
*  called the SOAV, the Special Operations Academic Facility. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3203.22s)]
*  And we're, you know, standing around the beginning of the day, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3207.34s)]
*  like drinking coffee, getting ready to go to class. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3210.98s)]
*  First day of class. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3213.54s)]
*  And there's television monitors on with CNN or whatever. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3214.86s)]
*  And we're watching the planes go into the tower. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3218.46s)]
*  And like, I think to a one, everyone knew that everything's changing right now. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3221.5s)]
*  It's like this is like 100 percent for real. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3226.7s)]
*  And like everyone was like, yeah, you know, that's how you felt. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3230.3s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. All the training. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3233.86s)]
*  Yeah. Like finally, we're going to do something. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3236.14s)]
*  So what happens then? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3239.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm in language school for another six months. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3241.5s)]
*  So what are you learning? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3244.18s)]
*  Thai. Why Thai? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3246.18s)]
*  Is this like my my unit's area of responsibility was Asia. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3249.58s)]
*  So I did do an Asian language and I liked Thai food. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3254.5s)]
*  So. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3260.38s)]
*  Graduate the Q course, like do a couple of J sets in Asia. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3263.5s)]
*  So J sets, joint combined exchange training. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3267.42s)]
*  So you basically go, your team goes and trains with a foreign [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3273.5s)]
*  special operations unit and you you teach them stuff or you, you know, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3278.78s)]
*  it's more just to like establish rapport and maybe get some access or whatever. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3282.54s)]
*  So do a couple of J sets in Asia and then [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3287.7799999999997s)]
*  get ready to go to Iraq to prep for the invasion like an O2. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3291.74s)]
*  And like spend a lot of time in Kuwait, just like training and getting preparing. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3297.62s)]
*  What was it like when you went there to Iraq? Yeah. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3303.06s)]
*  So. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3307.94s)]
*  That that was like my first like combat experience. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3309.86s)]
*  And so. It was unique in that. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3314.26s)]
*  So my team and a couple of other teams are basically attached to [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3319.1800000000003s)]
*  the fourth ID to provide kind of route reconnaissance and screening and stuff [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3325.3s)]
*  for the kind of this main conventional military, you know, invasion. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3329.86s)]
*  And so watching watching big army work, you know, do what they do best was pretty amazing. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3337.02s)]
*  Like like tank engagements like I never thought I'd witness that. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3343.54s)]
*  It was just almost like. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3350.1s)]
*  And it's probably a trite cliche, but like a movie, you know, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3354.34s)]
*  watching this massive mechanized force just like crush everything in its path. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3359.9s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3365.82s)]
*  When you were over, there was any doubt that you had done the right thing by enlisting and. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3368.9s)]
*  No doubt. No doubt at all. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3374.5800000000004s)]
*  You were geared up, ready to go. Yeah. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3376.34s)]
*  So what happened when you were over there? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3379.6600000000003s)]
*  I got some gunfights, you know, hit some targets [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3381.78s)]
*  and then redeployed back to the States. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3388.42s)]
*  You say that so casually, gotten gunfights and hit some targets like it had to be a pretty extreme experience. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3391.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but honestly, I think my Afghan experiences were more intense than Iraq for sure. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3397.38s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's just it was a different animal. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3403.34s)]
*  And what did that happen? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3407.1000000000004s)]
*  So did some rotations in Afghanistan following the Iraq invasion. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3408.78s)]
*  And it was kind of the more traditional like SF mission, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3415.6600000000003s)]
*  like working with indigenous troops and and leading them on on raids and things like that. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3419.82s)]
*  That's got to be a wild change of life to go from being a musician, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3427.7000000000003s)]
*  to go from being a deployed special operator in Afghanistan. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3434.26s)]
*  Like the shift in consciousness is so extreme. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3439.6200000000003s)]
*  Maybe. Maybe. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3445.98s)]
*  But I think I'm pretty good at just with rolling with stuff, you know, it's like, oh, this is happening now. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3447.2200000000003s)]
*  OK, but that's a big happening. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3454.6200000000003s)]
*  It's a huge happening. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3457.86s)]
*  Yeah. To be in combat. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3459.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, definitely, I think the war in combat was the most profound experience of my life for sure. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3463.6600000000003s)]
*  And I don't mean to maybe treat it lightly because I don't take it lightly. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3469.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes, by far the most profound experience of my life. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3475.34s)]
*  So many guys who come back from that, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3480.1000000000004s)]
*  not only do they say it's the most profound experience of their life, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3483.6200000000003s)]
*  but many of them say it was the best experience of their life. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3486.7400000000002s)]
*  I understand that for sure. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3490.9s)]
*  Like, I guess I can encapsulate it like this. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3495.9s)]
*  Like, you got your dudes, you know, your team, your little indigenous troopers, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3500.74s)]
*  and you're going to go crush some target. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3507.3399999999997s)]
*  And, you know, like, I never had a doubt that, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3509.8999999999996s)]
*  like, maybe I would get injured or killed, but that I never had a doubt that the mission would fail. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3515.3399999999997s)]
*  Just because the odds were just in our favor. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3521.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, it's like you got night vision, you got a cast stack, you got this huge support apparatus. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3523.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like, there's no way we're not going to win this fight. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3528.66s)]
*  But going on target, closing with destroying the enemy, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3534.02s)]
*  and then getting you and all your dudes back to base alive, best feeling in the world. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3540.06s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3545.1s)]
*  So many guys say that. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3547.18s)]
*  Best feeling in the world. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3548.58s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3550.18s)]
*  What is it like? What can you describe it? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3551.8599999999997s)]
*  It's... [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3555.94s)]
*  Or give an attempt? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3556.98s)]
*  I think, like, and I got my kind of evolutionary ideas about why that is. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3559.62s)]
*  I think that we're on a very essential level, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3567.78s)]
*  like doing what human beings are one of the things we're meant to do. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3574.34s)]
*  Or maybe one of the things we've always done. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3580.38s)]
*  Well, we're an adversarial species, but like every species in nature is adversarial. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3582.82s)]
*  You know, and it's not an evaluative statement. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3588.86s)]
*  It's just kind of an observation. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3593.06s)]
*  So I think on this, just the way our brains are, like evolutionarily, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3595.74s)]
*  like, OK, we're the monkeys with the big brains, right? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3601.82s)]
*  And we've created this very technologically advanced, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3605.62s)]
*  if not challenging environment now that we live in. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3610.66s)]
*  But the way our firmware up here, we're still hominids on the savanna, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3614.1s)]
*  you know, like 100 percent. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3620.3399999999997s)]
*  And so I think. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3622.8199999999997s)]
*  Through war, through combat, we kind of tap into that primal, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3625.62s)]
*  OK, this is what we're supposed to do, you know? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3630.2999999999997s)]
*  And was that surprising to have that part of your mind sort of ignited [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3633.7s)]
*  in a sense where you realize that this is like something that's deeply embedded in your DNA? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3639.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I know I'm making that claim, but it's not based on scientific research I've done. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3645.58s)]
*  It's just kind of an intuition. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3654.46s)]
*  Well, many, many make that claim. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3656.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not an uncommon thought. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3657.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So it rings true to me. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3660.1400000000003s)]
*  And like, have you read like that Sebastian Younger book, The Tribe? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3662.86s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3667.7400000000002s)]
*  And like his thesis, like that's the first kind of PTSD thesis I read that kind of rang true with me, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3670.02s)]
*  because like before that, the popular conception was, you know, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3676.82s)]
*  these young men and women go off to war and see horrible things and come back fucked up. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3680.78s)]
*  But like his thesis where they lose that tribe, right? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3686.7799999999997s)]
*  That task and purpose, unity of effort, you know, literally we're tribal creatures. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3691.1s)]
*  Like, that's how we operate. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3698.22s)]
*  Like I did a paper when I was doing my undergrad. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3701.38s)]
*  I think I was trying to investigate like genetic impetus for like human conflict or whatever. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3705.82s)]
*  And like some, one of the, during my research, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3712.7400000000002s)]
*  one of the things I found that was super interesting to me was the way psychologically we're equipped [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3716.3s)]
*  to deal with about 100 to 120 individuals. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3723.26s)]
*  Like that, that would be our extended tribe, our social group. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3727.6600000000003s)]
*  Dunbar's number. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3730.7400000000002s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3732.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3732.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3733.46s)]
*  Yeah. It's this group of people that you can contain in your mind. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3733.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3738.38s)]
*  And it's segmented. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3738.7799999999997s)]
*  There's like a small number of people that you're intimately attached to. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3740.42s)]
*  There's a larger number that are close, but more like associates and friends. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3745.1s)]
*  And then there's people that you know, and it extends out. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3751.06s)]
*  It actually extends even further than 120 or 150. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3753.7799999999997s)]
*  It gets to like people you are aware of. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3757.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3760.62s)]
*  But it's, it's fairly small, which is one of the weird things about knowing a lot of people. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3760.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3765.62s)]
*  That number gets really weird. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3765.94s)]
*  And then your memory of people, it's almost like your brain deletes them because there's no room. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3767.86s)]
*  Like, but then it's like, how well do you know them as well? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3775.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3778.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, like how intimate is that relationship? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3778.26s)]
*  But an interesting correlation I made like researching this paper was that that number is [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3781.5s)]
*  the same number in army task organization as an infantry company is 120. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3788.98s)]
*  And that's kind of like, you know, your main operational unit as a, in the infantry, at least [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3795.5s)]
*  like soft, you're dealing with smaller teams, smaller numbers. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3802.98s)]
*  But I thought, wow, 120, that's it. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3806.14s)]
*  You know, and is that by design or is that just the way it worked out? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3809.8599999999997s)]
*  It's probably, it goes back to our tribal roots, most likely that we evolved being accustomed to [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3812.8999999999996s)]
*  that group of people, that number of people or a similar number. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3820.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3823.46s)]
*  I mean, just survival. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3823.7000000000003s)]
*  Like, like our mission statement is biological organisms, you know, even like the big brain [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3824.78s)]
*  monkeys that we are, it's like, like survive and replicate the gene. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3831.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3836.86s)]
*  And like everything else is kind of window dressing, you know, and like you can window dress [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3837.1400000000003s)]
*  it however you want to make it seem more important than that. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3845.46s)]
*  But I'm a huge fan of the window dressing. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3848.1s)]
*  Like, like that's definitely the salt in the soup for sure. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3852.22s)]
*  But if you boil it down to, you know, it's, you know, what is the quiddity of being a human [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3855.62s)]
*  being? It's that, or any biological organism, like survive and replicate the gene. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3861.2599999999998s)]
*  And so the whole capacity for combat, for human warfare is like, even as an individual, if [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3867.7799999999997s)]
*  if you're killed in combat, if you go back to like this group of hominids on the savanna, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3878.14s)]
*  you're probably related to everyone in your group. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3884.7400000000002s)]
*  So it's like, OK, maybe I won't pass my genes on, but my cousin over here will. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3887.9s)]
*  So I'm going to support that effort. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3892.94s)]
*  So I think that kind of organized conflict, one group against another, is in support of [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3895.38s)]
*  that. Like, I think anthropologists have a term for it, pseudo kinship, where, say, in a [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3903.06s)]
*  combat situation. So you got like the classic scenario of like a dude jumping on a hand [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3910.94s)]
*  grenade to save his buddies. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3917.78s)]
*  You know, and that's like, that's hardwired. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3919.86s)]
*  That's not a conscious decision. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3922.94s)]
*  You know, because I think if if you had time to actually think about it, maybe you wouldn't [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3924.78s)]
*  do it. Right. You know, but it's that pseudo kinship. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3929.7s)]
*  Like. I think that's and to me, that's always what's been, I think, the most interesting [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3933.7s)]
*  paradox about war and combat is it's this event, this human event that simultaneously [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3943.2999999999997s)]
*  brings about acts of pure selfless love and brutality without quarter. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3951.98s)]
*  In the same instant. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3959.9399999999996s)]
*  So that's always intrigued me. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3962.4199999999996s)]
*  Well, it's always fascinating for me to talk to people that are intelligent like yourself, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3964.8999999999996s)]
*  that have experienced that, because that that thread that you're you're expressing, it [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3969.5s)]
*  seems to ring true with almost all of them, that there's there's something about it that [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3976.02s)]
*  although brutal and maybe in some ways unexpected, it also rings true with like a purpose [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3983.62s)]
*  and that your life is intimately connected to these people. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=3994.5s)]
*  And in some way that becomes more satisfying than any other way to live. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4000.02s)]
*  Yeah. And to hear a person like yourself, who's obviously very smart, express that it's [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4006.02s)]
*  always. It's really interesting to someone like myself who hasn't experienced that, but [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4011.06s)]
*  kind of understands what you're saying. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4016.34s)]
*  I'm sure you do. I mean, I'm sure it rings true with you, right? [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4020.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Like just just intuitively. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4023.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And you're aware of this while you're experiencing, because you're obviously [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4026.3s)]
*  an analytical person. So you're aware of this while you're experiencing it. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4031.86s)]
*  Um, so. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4035.98s)]
*  I can think of instances where I've had these flashes of awareness, like. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4039.8199999999997s)]
*  OK, I remember one target like we we have to like a helicopter assault force. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4046.94s)]
*  So I was on the second forty seven. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4055.1s)]
*  No, I think I was on the second lift. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4060.62s)]
*  I guess a pretty big element going in. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4061.98s)]
*  And I remember landing in this poppy field, like stepping off the ramp and like I could [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4064.78s)]
*  hear gunfire like there was already is already on right on target. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4070.34s)]
*  And so I got my little Afghan commando troopers. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4075.62s)]
*  So like, OK, man, let's go. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4080.38s)]
*  And like I'm running up this hill. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4083.2200000000003s)]
*  And I was aware in that moment, like, OK, this is odd that this is. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4085.26s)]
*  You know, the cliche of like running to the gunfire and I believe me, I don't consider [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4090.22s)]
*  myself like a heroic person at all. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4094.06s)]
*  It was it wasn't it wasn't even a conscious decision. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4096.38s)]
*  I was doing it and it was like I was trying to get there as quickly as I could. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4099.9s)]
*  And it did occur to me like, yeah, this is kind of weird. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4103.9s)]
*  You know. But it is your training and it also is your purpose. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4107.26s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4111.82s)]
*  And I don't know which supervenes on what, but yeah, for sure. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4113.0599999999995s)]
*  How bizarre was it, the whole poppy fields thing? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4117.099999999999s)]
*  Because I remember one of the most interesting aspects of the war was that we were [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4119.78s)]
*  protecting poppy fields. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4126.5s)]
*  And there was this weird video, I don't know if you've ever seen it, of Geraldo Rivera, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4128.34s)]
*  who was on Fox News spinning this in some sort of a way, but realizing how ridiculous [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4133.9s)]
*  it sounded while he was interviewing a general who was on the on the field or I don't [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4140.0199999999995s)]
*  remember as a general soldier who was on the field, who's explaining why they were doing [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4146.7s)]
*  this, that they were guarding the poppy fields so that these people could keep making [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4151.099999999999s)]
*  heroin. And, you know, you're you're looking at this and especially someone who has a [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4156.66s)]
*  knowledge of Vietnam, that it was intimately connected with drug running and that there [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4161.74s)]
*  was a lot of that going on. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4165.86s)]
*  That was part of the purpose of it. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4167.46s)]
*  And that somewhere someone was profiting off of this to the tune of billions of dollars. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4168.86s)]
*  And you're not exactly sure how or how it was being done or what involvement the United [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4175.26s)]
*  States military had in it. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4180.780000000001s)]
*  But in this particular instance, you're living in the era of social media and the [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4182.58s)]
*  Internet, not necessarily social media, but at least the Internet, where people are very [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4187.740000000001s)]
*  aware of things like that, that are at the very least inconsistent with the narrative [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4193.5s)]
*  that we have here in America. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4200.58s)]
*  The drugs are bad. Bad people sell drugs. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4201.86s)]
*  Bad people make drugs. We have to stop the drugs from getting into the country. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4204.54s)]
*  Now, here you are. You know, we're watching Geraldo Rivera, a Fox reporter, putting this [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4207.86s)]
*  like really clunky spin on why we have to do this. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4214.38s)]
*  And I can only imagine it's because it had already been exposed that the United States [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4218.98s)]
*  was doing that. And they had to say, well, we have to come up with some sort of an excuse [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4223.139999999999s)]
*  for why we're guarding heroin production. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4226.86s)]
*  So I guess my understanding of if if the U.S. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4229.14s)]
*  mill was doing that, it's probably like a secondary consideration, because like at least [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4234.34s)]
*  down south, like that's a huge part of the economy. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4239.26s)]
*  It's like opium production. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4242.1s)]
*  Yeah. And I would guess it would be eradicating like the poppy fields would be a worse [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4243.46s)]
*  choice, like like economically destabilizing. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4251.26s)]
*  Like like economically destabilizing, like, you know, these people who are already super [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4254.98s)]
*  poor. But it's also for sure. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4259.38s)]
*  Yeah. Aiding in the profit of selling heroin. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4263.46s)]
*  Oh, I mean, the Taliban would make money from opium production, you know, even though it's [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4266.62s)]
*  against Islam or whatever. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4271.58s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4272.78s)]
*  No, it was. I don't know how to crack that nut. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4274.139999999999s)]
*  Was that talked about over there? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4277.26s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like D.E.A. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4279.139999999999s)]
*  I know D.E.A. was over there doing doing their thing. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4281.5s)]
*  What were they doing? Selling it? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4284.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4286.62s)]
*  That's what's so strange is that it seems like, you know, especially when you have this [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4288.66s)]
*  disconnection from the mainstream media and from, you know, channels of information [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4295.86s)]
*  getting to other people, that this is a part of what's happening over there, that there's [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4302.58s)]
*  it was I believe at one point in time was 90 plus percent of the world's heroin. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4308.3s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4312.18s)]
*  Was coming from Afghanistan. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4313.26s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't I don't have an answer. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4316.06s)]
*  Bizarre though, right? Yeah. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4319.34s)]
*  Did you think how bizarre it was when it was just that was inconsequential? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4321.1s)]
*  That was not. Yeah, it wasn't like another poppy field. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4324.820000000001s)]
*  Like it was just part of landscape. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4327.58s)]
*  But yeah, I probably didn't put much thought into it. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4329.62s)]
*  How did they cultivate the pot? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4332.22s)]
*  I mean, they were doing all this in the middle of combat, in the middle of war. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4334.18s)]
*  Like, how were they handling all that? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4337.46s)]
*  I mean, like in my experience, like if we did hit a target that was like in a remote [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4340.02s)]
*  place like that, like they weren't they weren't seeing coalition forces often, if at all. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4347.5s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like they probably thought they were on a safe haven. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4356.1s)]
*  So. I mean, I think when you get closer to the. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4359.66s)]
*  The built up areas and at least at the time, I mean, like the whole Afghan government was so corrupt anyway. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4364.5s)]
*  So I think probably the main people making money were, you know, Afghan generals, you know, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4371.98s)]
*  which I think at one time the Afghan army had like three thousand general officers or something. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4378.42s)]
*  That like this inverted pyramid of leadership. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4383.62s)]
*  Like, oh, I'm a general, you know, and they all have mansions and it's all corruption money. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4386.58s)]
*  Where was that being a part? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4392.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's the side that you were on. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4394.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, you're you're you're over there sort of helping. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4396.82s)]
*  Yeah, like. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4401.219999999999s)]
*  I think you just got to focus on the tribe, right? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4405.46s)]
*  Like the it's like you and your dudes and you have this task and you're going to accomplish it to the best of your ability and bring everyone back alive. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4409.74s)]
*  And then the political side of it. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4419.7s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it'd be easy to get kind of demoralized. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4422.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's what if you focus on that. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4425.7s)]
*  Yeah. Was it bizarre for you as someone who has done heroin to think like, oh, this is where it comes from? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4428.14s)]
*  Um. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4433.66s)]
*  I mean, I think I was conscious of that, but like it didn't it wasn't that crazy. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4436.38s)]
*  It's like. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4441.900000000001s)]
*  So even though you knew that there's a rampant corruption and that there's a lot of things that were kind of fucked, it was still your tribe, your task. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4444.38s)]
*  Yep. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4452.860000000001s)]
*  Did did you spend any time pondering like whether or not that made sense or just just do what you were supposed to do? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4454.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think I reflected on it and then would just, you know, do it. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4463.82s)]
*  You know, did anybody talk about it over there? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4468.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4470.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I would talk about it, too. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4473.1s)]
*  Like, you know, as the war progressed, you would see these mansions being built around Kabul and stuff, you know, these ridiculous like concrete mansions and like that's our tax dollars are paying for that mansion, you know, or it's corruption money or it's it's opium money or whatever. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4474.58s)]
*  And it's just. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4491.42s)]
*  It's just part of the culture there, you know, like, how do you fix that? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4493.46s)]
*  It's like, like, I remember talking to one of our interpreters over there and like, so I'm not married, don't have a family. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4498.139999999999s)]
*  And so obviously everything over there is very family oriented or, you know, family tribe. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4509.58s)]
*  You know, that it's everything's geared towards like blood relations and things like that. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4517.94s)]
*  And like, like the stronger and larger your family is, the stronger your tribe is like that whole thing. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4522.219999999999s)]
*  It's like a different paradigm than we have in the, you know, the West. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4528.179999999999s)]
*  And so we're talking, we're just bullshitting. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4535.46s)]
*  And he's asked me about my family and I'm like, I don't, you know, I don't have a family, just me. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4538.299999999999s)]
*  But, you know, my neighbor has the keys to my house and, you know, they can go in, take care of stuff if I need something taken care of and all this. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4543.58s)]
*  And like the first thing he asked is like, and they do not steal all your things. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4551.18s)]
*  Because that's what he was thinking. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4558.660000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4560.14s)]
*  Like, oh, if I had your keys, I'd be stealing your shit. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4560.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4563.620000000001s)]
*  And that's the mentality. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4564.22s)]
*  Like that is just is different. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4565.42s)]
*  You know, the houses down there, each house, each family member, each family member, each family member, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4567.3s)]
*  family unit house is a miniature fortress, you know, and it's because it's this culture that that they habitually prey upon each other. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4572.82s)]
*  So the houses need to be these mini fortresses, you know, where here in the West, you know, like I don't I don't have a fence around my property. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4583.34s)]
*  My neighbors have my keys. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4590.219999999999s)]
*  Like, it's fine, you know. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4591.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4594.42s)]
*  How bizarre was that, though, to go over there and experience this completely different way of life with other human beings living on another part of the world, a completely different set of values, different goals and expectations, different religion? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4595.38s)]
*  It was fascinating. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4611.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4613.179999999999s)]
*  Like, just because that part of the world, like Central Asia is like such a fascinating part of the world, like all the way back to antiquity. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4613.62s)]
*  All the history that's like transpired, you know, in that area, like any chance I got to see something like somewhat historical, like there's still remains of like Greek ruins from 300 B.C. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4621.3s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4637.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4637.74s)]
*  In Afghanistan? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4638.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4638.98s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4639.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4640.0599999999995s)]
*  There was a whole I never got to this town, but up on the Oxus River, and it's there's been several attempts over the decades to do an archaeological excavation of the entire city. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4640.94s)]
*  But it's like it's a no shit Greek city in Central Asia. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4655.419999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4659.299999999999s)]
*  So when Alexander of Macedon, when Mastodon, Mastodon, when Alexander of Macedon. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4660.62s)]
*  Alexander the Great. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4667.86s)]
*  Yeah, was his campaign in Asia. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4668.66s)]
*  So he pushed all the way to the Indus River. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4671.78s)]
*  But what he would do along the way is establish Alexandrias. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4674.22s)]
*  So, you know, Alexandria and Egypt, but there's multiple Alexandrias like the etymology of Kandahar, the town in Afghanistan is, you know, if you go back, it was Iskandahar. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4679.099999999999s)]
*  And Iskandahar literally means Alexandria. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4692.9s)]
*  That was one of the Alexandrias that he established in Central Asia and all over Persia and Asia Minor. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4695.62s)]
*  And like that was the thing. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4705.66s)]
*  And so and it was a way to kind of maintain a foothold in that part of the world, like build a city, establish like a Greek education system to educate the locals in the Greek model. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4707.26s)]
*  So he was kind of projecting, you know, he was in it for the long game. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4722.9s)]
*  Like this is part of Greece. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4728.259999999999s)]
*  It's going to be Greek. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4729.62s)]
*  And the Greco-Bactrian Empire, if you want to call it that, probably lasted like 100 years. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4731.419999999999s)]
*  And then it just fell apart. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4738.58s)]
*  Are there, is there like documentation of the Greek cities, the ruins in Afghanistan? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4740.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4746.54s)]
*  Jamie, can you pull some of that up so you can find that? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4747.219999999999s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4749.339999999999s)]
*  I had no idea. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4750.0199999999995s)]
*  So the old Alexandria. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4751.379999999999s)]
*  So there it is. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4754.0199999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4754.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4755.58s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4757.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4758.9s)]
*  And so that's just abandoned now. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4759.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4761.0599999999995s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4762.62s)]
*  And is this from 300 BC? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4764.54s)]
*  Yeah, around that. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4766.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4768.299999999999s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4771.0599999999995s)]
*  I had no idea. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4771.98s)]
*  So at one point in time, that had been some sort of a thriving community. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4774.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4781.62s)]
*  The city on the Oxus, that I can I can see where it says I can in Wikipedia. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4781.86s)]
*  That was the city on the Oxus. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4788.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4790.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4791.46s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4793.42s)]
*  So they had an amphitheater. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4794.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4795.339999999999s)]
*  It was a full on Greek city. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4795.66s)]

*  That I'm not sure. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4833.98s)]
*  But there's a lot of historians think that like, like the Vedas and Buddhism kind of [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4836.62s)]
*  started like more in the Afghanistan area. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4843.099999999999s)]

*  Yeah, there's tons of, there's some really cool, there's some really cool, there's some [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4855.0599999999995s)]
*  really cool, there's some really cool, there's some really cool, there's some really cool, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4860.9s)]
*  so there was this really interesting period of history of Greco-Buddhism in Central Asia. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4864.299999999999s)]
*  There was one, one of the Greco-Bactrian kings, Menander, actually converted to Buddhism. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4870.74s)]
*  And there was this brief moment of, brief period of Greco-Buddhism in Central Asia. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4877.9s)]
*  And so the, the Buddhas that were carved, so they're carving statues of the Buddha and [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4885.42s)]
*  stuff, but it's in this total Greco-Roman style. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4892.0599999999995s)]
*  So they're beautiful pieces of art. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4895.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's, it's literally a Greek Buddha. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4897.7s)]
*  You know, you look, you look at it stylistically and it's like, that's Greek, but it's a [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4901.58s)]
*  Buddha and it's cool, cool, you know, flash in the pan of history. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4906.42s)]
*  See if you can find the images of that. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4911.74s)]
*  Are those all gone? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4913.62s)]
*  Taliban blow them all up? [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4915.0199999999995s)]
*  No, I mean these, so there's actually some at the, at the Met in New York that I've [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4916.18s)]
*  seen. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4923.58s)]
*  I've seen some at the National Museum in Kabul. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4925.7s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4930.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4933.58s)]
*  That's so strange because it's so obviously like influenced by Greek art. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4935.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4940.22s)]

*  Wow. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4946.9s)]
*  That's really, really cool. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4948.94s)]
*  Really interesting. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4950.139999999999s)]
*  Human civilization is so bizarre. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4952.94s)]
*  The rise and fall of these empires and these civilizations and for you to go and [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4955.099999999999s)]
*  visit it in the middle of combat must have been particularly bizarre. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4961.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4967.74s)]
*  Like I would, like I would try to, I try to get in, do my share of, for lack of a [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4968.38s)]
*  better term, like tourism. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4976.14s)]
*  Like, like I went to the old Citadel outside of Kandahar where you right now, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4978.46s)]
*  when you're on the ground, it doesn't look like anything, but if you go to like [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4985.18s)]
*  Google Earth, you can see the old outline of the city walls and you could see the, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4988.9800000000005s)]
*  like the Citadel in the middle. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4992.900000000001s)]
*  And it's like, it's still there, the remains of it. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4995.22s)]
*  Um, like up in Nuristan, which is a super interesting part of Afghanistan. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=4998.58s)]
*  It's, it's like the Northeast part of the country and it's a region that wasn't [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5007.78s)]
*  even converted to Islam until the end of the 19th century. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5014.38s)]
*  Like it's, you can make the analogy of they're like the Basque in Spain, right? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5018.54s)]
*  It was like this mountainous region that kind of was able to retain like its [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5023.58s)]
*  cultural and linguistic identity because of the terrain, like it was more [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5027.74s)]
*  defendable. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5031.9s)]
*  So Nuristan was like that as well. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5032.9s)]
*  And so they were finally forcibly converted to Islam into the 19th century. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5034.54s)]
*  And before that they were called Kofiristan, which is like land of the [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5040.58s)]
*  infidel. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5043.94s)]
*  And then once they underwent the conversion process, they became Nuristan, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5045.58s)]
*  which is land of the enlightened. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5050.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5052.42s)]
*  But it's, it's such an interesting place. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5053.099999999999s)]
*  I liked it a lot because it reminded me of home where I grew up. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5056.58s)]
*  Cause you have like Alpine forest. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5060.06s)]
*  It looks like Yosemite. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5061.860000000001s)]
*  Like, like if they could ever have peace there, they could have like a trekking [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5063.700000000001s)]
*  industry, um, you know, eco tourism, whatever, like white river rafting down [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5068.22s)]
*  the Kunar river, like is it is gorgeous. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5074.22s)]
*  And there, there was places where in Afghanistan, I was like, I could be home [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5078.3s)]
*  on the Olympic peninsula right now. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5083.26s)]
*  Like mountains, Alpine forest. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5085.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5087.54s)]
*  There's the old Citadel. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5087.9s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5090.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5091.46s)]
*  I had no idea this stuff was there. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5093.46s)]
*  The history of Afghanistan is so fascinating and so spectacular and so [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5096.139999999999s)]
*  like the futility of trying to conquer that place and control that place. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5103.259999999999s)]
*  It's going to be what it's going to be. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5108.66s)]
*  And yeah, like, uh, you're not, you're not, you're not going to change it. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5110.74s)]
*  You know, you're not going to Westernize it. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5117.62s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5119.14s)]
*  Did you like, it's, it's so crazy that we were there for so long. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5121.54s)]
*  It's a 20 year war. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5126.54s)]
*  Would you have ever imagined that while you were there? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5128.22s)]
*  No, like if you would have told me, um, uh, September 10th, 2001, like, oh yeah, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5130.3s)]
*  we're getting ready to be in a 20 year war in the Middle East and Central Asia. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5137.14s)]
*  I would have been like, no fucking way. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5140.660000000001s)]
*  That's, that's just not going to happen. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5142.46s)]
*  You know, and then boom. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5144.58s)]
*  What did it, what was it like to you when we pulled out of it? [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5147.660000000001s)]
*  Finally? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5150.5s)]
*  Um, on the one hand, it was like a relief. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5151.780000000001s)]
*  It's like, you know, enough already. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5154.54s)]
*  It's like, we're obviously not fixing that place. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5157.18s)]
*  You know, it's doubtful. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5160.9400000000005s)]
*  We could fix it. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5163.06s)]
*  Um, I think it would have been clever to hold onto Bagram and maintain a strike [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5164.9400000000005s)]
*  force there to, to put out fires, so to speak. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5171.5s)]
*  But other than that, like, let it be what it's going to be, you know, and like [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5175.18s)]
*  protect us interests as needed, but you know, we, we're not going to change that [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5179.9400000000005s)]
*  place. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5186.54s)]
*  It's so, it's so crazy that we didn't learn from the Russian invasion. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5187.06s)]
*  We didn't learn from the Russians battle in the Mujahideen and which we support it, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5192.06s)]
*  which is, it's so strange that everyone makes the same mistakes or the British or [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5197.54s)]
*  the, or the Greeks. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5203.02s)]
*  You know, it's like the, the, the, the Greek foothold there lasted, you know, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5203.9800000000005s)]
*  what, a hundred years, like so historically that's nothing. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5208.820000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5213.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5213.54s)]
*  Just like, there's no place like it on earth in that regard. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5214.580000000001s)]
*  It's like, because of the terrain, because of the people and the religion and the, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5219.5s)]
*  just the, the, the way it's controlled areas are controlled by warlords. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5224.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5229.74s)]
*  It's all tribal. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5229.900000000001s)]
*  It's all, and that that's the way they, politically that's the way they govern [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5230.74s)]
*  themselves. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5236.38s)]
*  And that's just the, you know, and it's, it's not even an evaluative statement. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5236.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's not Western style, but okay. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5241.54s)]
*  You know, what, what are you going to do? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5246.74s)]
*  You know, they, they got a, at some point, as long as they're not impinging upon, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5249.54s)]
*  it's, it's, I guess I have a very libertarian perspective. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5256.06s)]
*  Like, you know, if they don't fuck with us, we shouldn't fuck with them. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5259.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5264.06s)]
*  You know? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5264.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5264.9400000000005s)]
*  That's, that's, there's a futility in trying to be the policeman of the world. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5265.3s)]
*  It's exhausting. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5273.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5273.860000000001s)]
*  You know, and, and ultimately you're going to fail. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5274.5s)]
*  You know, you're going to, you're going to drain all your resources trying to [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5278.22s)]
*  manage something literally on the other side of the planet to what end. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5281.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5286.46s)]
*  You know? [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5286.820000000001s)]
*  And then there's these entities that are profiting off of that futile attempt, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5287.58s)]
*  which they would like to continue that money flowing in. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5294.3s)]
*  So they continue this, this thing that everybody knows you're eventually [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5296.9400000000005s)]
*  going to have to stop. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5301.3s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5303.02s)]
*  It turned into an industry for sure. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5303.740000000001s)]
*  And were you aware of that while you were there that that was, that [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5306.38s)]
*  there was no way out of this? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5310.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't, I guess I always suspected that it would never be. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5313.700000000001s)]
*  Like it wasn't going to be like, Hey, check this out. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5323.3s)]
*  Democracy. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5325.660000000001s)]
*  It's cool. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5326.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5327.900000000001s)]
*  You know, like I pretty much knew that wasn't going to fly. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5328.22s)]
*  Um, I think the best I could hope for was this stability, you know? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5332.06s)]
*  And that didn't happen. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5337.26s)]
*  No, you know, there was, uh, some really bizarre moments after we pulled out of [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5338.26s)]
*  Afghanistan, where they were interviewing the Taliban and talking to them about [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5343.860000000001s)]
*  women being in control or women, you know, being in government and whether or not [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5348.5s)]
*  they were going to accept sort of this Western idea of diversity and inclusion. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5353.9800000000005s)]
*  And they were just fucking laughing. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5359.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5361.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5362.38s)]
*  It's, uh, it's absurd to them. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5362.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5364.18s)]
*  You know, just, just like the other side of the coin is absurd to us. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5364.42s)]
*  So how do you bridge that gap? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5368.900000000001s)]
*  Especially when you're dealing with the history of the place that the, you know, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5371.02s)]
*  hundreds of years, hundreds and hundreds of years of living that way. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5377.18s)]
*  The idea that we're going to go in there with tanks and fix it. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5381.22s)]
*  We're going to force you to be democratic. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5386.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5388.06s)]
*  It's like, okay, that's not going to happen either. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5388.46s)]
*  And also the rampant corruption that exists in the people that are in power. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5390.62s)]
*  You know, when you're talking about all these mansions and the selling of the [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5396.66s)]
*  heroin and it's like, what are you going to do? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5399.54s)]
*  How are you going to get those people to straighten out? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5401.62s)]
*  You're not. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5404.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5405.42s)]
*  It's, it's, it's ingrained. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5406.18s)]
*  It's, it's, it's cultural. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5407.66s)]
*  It's maybe even more than cultural, you know? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5409.58s)]
*  Was there a time when you were over there, like towards the end of your time there [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5412.38s)]
*  where you were recognizing the fertility of this? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5416.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think big pictures. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5422.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5423.9s)]
*  But again, you're there to do a job. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5424.54s)]
*  So you can't, you can't do all in the negative, you know? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5427.94s)]
*  And it's like, you, you, you need to believe in the mission, you know? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5432.62s)]
*  And I believed in the mission as far as like myself and my teammates, like [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5438.7s)]
*  we're, we're going to do what we have to do and do it to the best of our ability [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5445.54s)]
*  and everyone come home alive, you know? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5449.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5451.94s)]
*  Complete your task, support your tribe. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5452.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5455.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5455.58s)]
*  When, how many years, how long were you over there for? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5456.78s)]
*  I did like four rotations. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5460.66s)]
*  So I, I left the army the second time, like 2007 when I was, um, basically went back to school. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5462.94s)]
*  What was it like to make that transition from being over there in one of the most [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5472.26s)]
*  bizarre wars we've ever been a part of, and then going back to school and going back to [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5478.74s)]
*  civilized society and going back to Western culture? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5485.780000000001s)]
*  Uh, again, I think just my disposition, I tend to just go with things. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5489.9400000000005s)]
*  You have a very unusual disposition. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5497.66s)]
*  Really? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5499.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5499.820000000001s)]
*  Like, uh, I think four out of five ex-girlfriends polled would suggest, uh, I'm good at [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5500.42s)]
*  compartmentalizing things. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5506.66s)]
*  Four out of five? [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5509.42s)]
*  What about the fifth? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5510.58s)]
*  No, I'm guessing. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5511.46s)]
*  No, it's just, I made the transition. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5516.14s)]
*  I thought, well, it's like, okay, cool. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5518.5s)]
*  I'm in school. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5520.900000000001s)]
*  Like now, now working on this chapter, you know? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5521.74s)]
*  Why do you think some people struggle so much and you were able to sort of, uh, at [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5525.86s)]
*  least fairly smoothly make that transition? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5531.54s)]
*  I don't have the answer to that. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5534.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5536.9800000000005s)]
*  Did you have friends that struggled? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5537.46s)]
*  Um, I think, I mean, most of my friends from the military are, are soft guys. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5539.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5545.46s)]
*  And I think in general, like they're adaptable, you know, that's, I think that's kind [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5546.22s)]
*  of a soft, soft, a special operations soldier criteria is you need to be flexible [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5553.1s)]
*  and adaptable and, and, and quick on your feet like that. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5558.14s)]
*  And more resilient. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5562.34s)]
*  They're more resilient human beings. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5563.38s)]
*  I would think so. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5565.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5566.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5566.780000000001s)]
*  I would think so too. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5566.9400000000005s)]
*  At least my experience with them. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5568.14s)]
*  The, um, I've had conversations with, um, special forces guys where I explain, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5570.1s)]
*  where they explained to me the reason why less of them experience, um, the kind of PTSD [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5576.34s)]
*  that some of the other guys had. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5584.62s)]
*  And they said, because we were proactive, we weren't reactive. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5586.22s)]
*  We were going and doing things. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5589.54s)]
*  It wasn't like we're sitting around waiting to be attacked. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5591.38s)]
*  And some of the guys that are sitting around waiting to be attacked, the anxiety of [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5594.46s)]
*  that was kind of overwhelming. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5597.66s)]
*  I can see that. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5600.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5601.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5601.38s)]
*  If you're just sitting on a fob, like waiting for that rocket attack. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5602.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5606.9400000000005s)]
*  And so you come back in 2007 and you decided you're done. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5608.46s)]
*  That's it. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5614.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5615.34s)]
*  So I was at a, at another crossroads and it was like, I can reenlist or I can go to [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5615.74s)]
*  university. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5624.62s)]
*  So I applied, a friend of mine in New York was like, you're pretty smart. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5625.74s)]
*  You should apply to Columbia. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5632.7s)]
*  And I was like, I would never get accepted there. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5634.26s)]
*  You know, that's, that's not going to happen. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5638.34s)]
*  And so almost as a joke, I applied to Columbia and I applied to Seattle [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5640.82s)]
*  university as well. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5645.18s)]
*  Um, only two schools I applied to, um, and ended up getting accepted to both. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5646.9400000000005s)]
*  And so with the Columbia thing, it was like, um, okay, am I going to step up to [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5653.74s)]
*  the challenge or, you know, go, I mean, not necessarily the easier route, but [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5661.98s)]
*  maybe the more comfortable route, which would have been Seattle U. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5668.94s)]
*  Um, and I went for Columbia. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5672.9s)]
*  It's like, okay, challenge accepted, you know. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5675.9s)]
*  And what did you study in Columbia? [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5680.46s)]
*  Philosophy. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5682.18s)]
*  Um, a lot of money in philosophy. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5683.860000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5686.06s)]
*  I don't know if you knew that. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5686.46s)]
*  I heard it's right up there with gender studies. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5688.540000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5690.02s)]
*  Do you like some coffee? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5692.18s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5693.1s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5699.9400000000005s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5700.5s)]
*  Um, so how much time did you do there? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5702.860000000001s)]
*  So they, they accepted a lot of my Olympic college credits shockingly. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5704.9s)]
*  Um, and they accepted my, my military language school for my language requirement. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5710.74s)]
*  Um, so I basically had to do three years there to finish my undergrad. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5717.0199999999995s)]
*  And then you went to graduate school as well? [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5722.46s)]
*  Uh, I had a break, but yeah, ended up, uh, going to graduate school. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5724.339999999999s)]
*  Um, 2016, maybe. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5729.82s)]
*  And what do you do now? [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5735.46s)]
*  So now I'm mostly do, uh, yacht delivery. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5737.0599999999995s)]
*  Yacht delivery? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5743.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5744.5s)]
*  Sailboats. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5744.58s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5745.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5746.34s)]
*  And was that like, how did that come about? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5748.139999999999s)]
*  So there's a story there. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5752.219999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5753.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5755.179999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5755.7s)]
*  So there's a story there. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5756.66s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5757.62s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5759.5s)]
*  Um, let me organize this real quick in my head. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5759.98s)]
*  It like 2014, like, okay. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5763.7s)]
*  So I'd finished my undergrad. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5766.9s)]
*  Um, I was now holder of an Ivy league degree, like much to my chagrin. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5769.14s)]
*  And I went through a personal crisis that was, was pretty bad. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5776.26s)]
*  Um, it was almost up there with like the sound garden, personal crisis. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5780.98s)]
*  Um, and so I kind of did a similar thing where it's like, okay, I need to take [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5787.9s)]
*  some time off, you know, to do, um, some work on myself, you know? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5792.7s)]
*  And so how that translated was I'd always been really interested in Argentina [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5800.139999999999s)]
*  as a, as a country and as a place. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5806.219999999999s)]
*  So I got a flat in Buenos Aires and went and lived there for a couple months. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5808.42s)]
*  And kind of did this deep period of introspection. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5813.58s)]
*  But during this time, um, before I left, a good friend of mine suggested this [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5817.66s)]
*  book called dove written by a man named Robin Lee Graham. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5824.9400000000005s)]
*  And so he's like, he's like, Hey, I just read this book. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5830.54s)]
*  You should read it. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5833.22s)]
*  I think you'd really dig it. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5833.9800000000005s)]
*  And, uh, I didn't even know what it was about. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5835.06s)]
*  So, um, I found a used copy and took with me down there and read it. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5836.700000000001s)]
*  And so it's, it's the story. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5842.780000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you've even heard of this, this story of Robin Graham, but he did, [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5844.38s)]
*  I think he started in 1967. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5849.740000000001s)]
*  He did a solo circumnavigation in a sailboat that took him about five years to do. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5851.9400000000005s)]
*  But he, at the time he was the youngest person to ever do that. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5858.18s)]
*  He started out as a sailboat pilot. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5861.18s)]
*  He was the youngest person to ever do that. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5863.0199999999995s)]
*  He started when he was like 15. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5864.82s)]
*  And it was, it was like, it got a lot of press, like national geographic covered it. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5867.419999999999s)]
*  I think he's been on the cover of national geographic, like three times. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5872.339999999999s)]
*  And so it's an interesting account. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5877.0199999999995s)]
*  His solo circumnavigation, um, took him five years, uh, along the way, he met [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5880.179999999999s)]
*  the, this woman, Patty, like this young, you know, pretty hippie chick, like [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5885.379999999999s)]
*  somewhere in the South Pacific. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5890.78s)]
*  And they fell in love and like got married and she would kind of meet him in [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5892.5s)]
*  different spots as he finished the circumnavigation. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5895.860000000001s)]
*  And then the book ends, um, he returns to Los Angeles, uh, circumnavigation complete. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5899.22s)]
*  Um, and I'm, I'm like super cynical, like going, okay, what happened now? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5907.3s)]
*  You know? [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5911.860000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, I bet that marriage didn't last, you know, cause after something, I [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5912.18s)]
*  guess I equated it to like a war zone romance or something, you know, where [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5917.3s)]
*  you're kind of in this super heightened environment. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5921.34s)]
*  So if you bring it back to just normal life, like, does it survive? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5924.5s)]
*  Like is like, what made it interesting or exciting or whatever, you know, do you [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5929.900000000001s)]
*  kind of get back to reality and it's like, eh, you know, you're not that [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5935.26s)]
*  interesting or whatever. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5939.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5940.9800000000005s)]
*  Um, so yeah, I'm super cynical, like that marriage didn't last whatever. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5941.820000000001s)]
*  So, but then I started doing some internet research on, on Rob and Graham [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5947.5s)]
*  and turns out he wrote like a second book, um, called, um, the sailor returns [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5951.62s)]
*  from the sea or something like that. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5957.18s)]
*  So what, what had happened, um, and he, he did go through kind of a dark period [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5958.9400000000005s)]
*  after the circumnavigation, um, that I won't get into that he told me about it [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5965.18s)]
*  personally. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5972.1s)]
*  So he and Patty in like the early 1970s, so they get back from like five years, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5973.34s)]
*  you know, sailing the world basically. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5980.62s)]
*  Um, it's pre internet, pre the, the communication that we have now. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5982.78s)]
*  So obviously 1965 to 1970 was a pretty turbulent period in like American history. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5987.099999999999s)]
*  And so Robin essentially missed all that and he gets back to the States and was [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=5994.54s)]
*  it a Stanford? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6001.42s)]
*  I think Stanford offered him like a full ride scholarship. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6002.26s)]
*  So he went for a semester and basically couldn't deal with all these lefty [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6005.9800000000005s)]
*  professors and like, I'm out of here. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6010.26s)]
*  And so he and Patty loaded up, uh, like bought like a mail truck, I think, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6014.42s)]
*  loaded up all their stuff and went to Montana and homesteaded in Montana, like [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6019.38s)]
*  super old school, like 19th century homestead. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6024.38s)]
*  Wow. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6027.02s)]
*  And so I'm doing this research and it's like, Oh, Kalispell, Montana. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6027.9800000000005s)]
*  Um, my buddy, Mike from Ranger Battalion lives in Kalispell, Montana. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6032.74s)]
*  So I'm in my flat in Buenos Aires and I email Mike. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6036.46s)]
*  I'm like, Hey dude, you know, a guy in Kalispell named Robin Graham, like 30 [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6040.7s)]
*  minutes later, I get an email like, yeah, I saw him in Costco yesterday. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6045.78s)]
*  It's like no fucking way. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6050.38s)]
*  It's like no fucking way. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6052.7s)]
*  And so, Hey, can you, can you do like an email introduction for me? [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6055.38s)]
*  And he's like, yeah. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6059.179999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, fast forward to today, um, I'm very happy and proud to call [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6060.38s)]
*  Robin and Patty friends, you know, like, uh, amazing human beings, like so cool. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6068.42s)]
*  And so the sailing thing to bring it back, like reading Dove and like [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6074.98s)]
*  getting to know Robin and stuff, I started getting interested in sailing. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6082.139999999999s)]
*  And like, I, you know, I live in Western Washington on Puget Sound. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6087.179999999999s)]
*  Like it's a, it's a very nautical culture. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6092.299999999999s)]
*  And I worked on boats in Alaska and actually come from kind of a nautical [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6094.98s)]
*  family on my father's side, like they all worked on tug boats and on the Columbia [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6098.74s)]
*  River, um, like, uh, my grandfather, my dad, my uncles, um, my dad was a [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6103.14s)]
*  commercial fisherman in Alaska, like ran his own boat for decades. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6109.42s)]
*  And so it seemed like kind of a natural thing. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6113.820000000001s)]
*  Like I've always been attracted to boats in the water. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6115.5s)]
*  So I started, started looking, you know, did the practical thing, started [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6117.9800000000005s)]
*  looking for a sailboat and I found one for sale that was about 10 miles from my house. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6121.06s)]
*  But I knew nothing about sailboats. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6128.1s)]
*  So I'm like pinging people I know who do know stuff about sailboats. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6129.62s)]
*  I'm like, Hey, is this boat any good? [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6134.5s)]
*  You know, let, you know, look at the pictures, look at the year [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6136.54s)]
*  and the design and everything. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6139.46s)]
*  So it was a 1986, Geno sunrise 34 sloop. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6141.38s)]
*  And like all these people like, yeah, it's a good boat. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6147.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a good boat. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6148.94s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6149.58s)]
*  And the price is right. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6150.3s)]
*  So I'm watching it and the price kept dropping and kept dropping. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6151.62s)]
*  And then it got low enough where it's like, it was kind of in my realm. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6157.219999999999s)]
*  So I contacted the broker and like actually went down and looked at the boat, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6162.099999999999s)]
*  like did a walkthrough and I was like, so is the seller taking offers on this? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6166.66s)]
*  And he's just like, yeah, make one. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6175.94s)]
*  And so I went, I had some deployment money saved up and I had, I could [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6177.86s)]
*  pile up about 17 grand. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6184.099999999999s)]
*  And so at the time, so I offered 17,000 and like half hour later, it's like, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6186.58s)]
*  you got a boat. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6191.3s)]
*  So, um, that, that was the beginning of my, my personal, you know, sailing [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6192.94s)]
*  adventures. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6200.3s)]
*  Did you live on it? [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6201.0199999999995s)]
*  Nope. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6202.179999999999s)]
*  My folks did that for a while when they retired. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6203.179999999999s)]
*  Um, my mom and my stepdad decided to live on a sailboat. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6206.98s)]
*  They flew around the keys and they went down to the Bahamas. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6210.5s)]
*  They just decided to just live on a boat for a while until my mom got bored with it. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6213.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6217.42s)]
*  My mom was like, well, this is a kind of fucking place. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6217.9400000000005s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6220.06s)]
*  But I think it was a very, um, educational and, um, an enlightening [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6221.78s)]
*  experience to just live in nature on the ocean for a while. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6229.66s)]
*  You know, that's very, uh, that's a, you know, wanderlust appeal to a lot of [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6234.82s)]
*  people to just get on a boat and live on a boat and wake up and have coffee on [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6240.78s)]
*  the ocean just exist out there. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6244.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6248.34s)]
*  I, I bought the boat with the intent, at least the vague intent of doing a [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6248.62s)]
*  circumnavigation of my own, just because it seems like such a, like what appeals [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6254.86s)]
*  to me about sailing is, I mean, outside of like electronic navigational aids, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6262.0599999999995s)]
*  it's the same as it's always been. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6268.3s)]
*  It's like you and the boat and, and the sea and the wind and, you [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6271.9s)]
*  know, you got to make it work. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6277.74s)]
*  And there's something like really, like when you actually get out on the water [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6280.62s)]
*  and you got the sails up and you're on a good tack and the boat's doing its [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6287.78s)]
*  thing, it's a, it's an awesome feeling. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6292.78s)]
*  It's like, I'm not going to quite say it's primal because obviously [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6294.98s)]
*  hominids on the Savannah didn't have sailboats, but it's close to that. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6298.66s)]
*  It's obviously very appealing. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6303.42s)]
*  I mean, people love to do it. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6305.179999999999s)]
*  They, the, and the sailboat thing is like, that's like the, the highest level [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6306.78s)]
*  of expression of nautical experience for a lot of people. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6313.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6316.86s)]
*  I think like being a true sailor is like sailing. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6317.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6321.66s)]
*  And like even at the, at the Navy Academy at Annapolis, like the, the [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6322.820000000001s)]
*  incense, they put them on sailboats to, to teach them to be sailors, you know, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6328.3s)]
*  like on that very fundamental level. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6333.46s)]
*  And it's, it's like anything else. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6337.06s)]
*  It's like, like being a soldier or a musician or like, I think you have to [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6339.06s)]
*  master the fundamentals because if you, if you suck at the fundamentals, you're [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6346.38s)]
*  going to suck at everything else. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6350.58s)]
*  So I've, I've always focused on fundamentals. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6352.58s)]
*  I mean, mainly because I'm, I'm not naturally good at anything really. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6355.06s)]
*  Like I've always had to try. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6361.42s)]
*  And so in the support of, in the service of trying to be good at something, I've [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6363.9800000000005s)]
*  always focused on the fundamentals and trying to master them and hopefully just [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6369.38s)]
*  have a good foundation. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6374.02s)]
*  I mean, that's one thing that was like unique about growing up as like a [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6376.34s)]
*  soldier in, in ranger battalion. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6380.66s)]
*  Cause ranger battalion is like super, like regiment's a unique animal. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6382.78s)]
*  Like even within the military, even within the soft community, it's, it's, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6387.82s)]
*  it's its own thing culturally. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6391.9s)]
*  And they always stress the fundamentals and you know, it's like being a private [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6395.18s)]
*  in ranger regiment is, it's not easy, but the fact that it's hard, I would [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6403.82s)]
*  think makes you a better soldier. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6413.42s)]
*  Cause there's no, there's like NCOs and ranger regiment don't, they don't tolerate [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6417.58s)]
*  anything less than a hundred percent, you know, and if, if you bring anything less [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6427.38s)]
*  than a hundred percent, you're going to find out really quick and you usually in [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6432.06s)]
*  a way that's not pleasant. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6435.900000000001s)]
*  And so I think having that foundation as a ranger private, I mean, I'm not going [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6438.06s)]
*  to say I'm any kind of amazing soldier, but I think it made me the best soldier [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6446.700000000001s)]
*  that I could be for sure. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6451.26s)]
*  And I'll always look back at regiment is like being a very key event in my life, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6454.5s)]
*  like my time there. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6460.900000000001s)]
*  Well, I think that any particularly difficult endeavor strengthens your resolve and [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6462.46s)]
*  basically everything you do in life. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6468.9400000000005s)]
*  And when you're forced to do something that's very, very hard to do, it just changes [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6471.06s)]
*  who you are at, you know, at a foundational level. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6476.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6481.02s)]
*  I think it's that punctuated equilibrium that referenced earlier. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6481.26s)]
*  It's like you need, you need that traumatic event to be a catalyst for growth. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6485.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6490.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, these big events in life that change the progression of the rest of your [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6491.5s)]
*  life. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6498.38s)]
*  And then you look back and go, wow, what would have happened if not for that moment? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6499.42s)]
*  Well, if not for that experience. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6503.5s)]
*  So did you decide not to circumnavigate the globe? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6506.1s)]
*  I mean, that's like a huge endeavor. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6510.86s)]
*  It would take, I think at a minimum a year and like, I don't know when the last time [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6514.02s)]
*  you had a free year. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6519.86s)]
*  I don't have any time. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6520.86s)]
*  Like, like even the first year of COVID, it was like, and it was the most free time I [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6521.86s)]
*  probably had in my adult life. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6525.82s)]
*  And it was still like, not a lot, you know? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6527.86s)]
*  So it's something, oh yeah, I would still love to do it. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6531.82s)]
*  I think being able to go, like there's islands in the South Atlantic or even in the [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6534.58s)]
*  Pacific that they don't have an airport. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6541.78s)]
*  The only way you're going to get there is by boat, you know? [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6546.54s)]
*  And now I think that'd be really cool to see. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6549.9800000000005s)]
*  Like some of the kind of the last, like you can't say unexplored, but kind of the last [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6551.7s)]
*  like remote places on the planet. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6556.5s)]
*  I would also imagine you would meet some very fascinating people that are also doing [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6558.780000000001s)]
*  that. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6562.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think so too. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6565.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6566.34s)]
*  So like the sailing, like kind of the 50 meter target right now with sailing is, have [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6567.860000000001s)]
*  you ever heard of Race to Alaska? [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6572.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6575.26s)]
*  So it's this adventure race, kind of a quirky adventure race that's based back home [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6576.22s)]
*  where I live. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6582.74s)]
*  And it's a boat race from port towns in Washington to Ketchikan, Alaska. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6584.66s)]
*  And there's really only one cardinal rule and there's a lot of other rules, but they [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6591.78s)]
*  are pretty much deal with like safety at sea and things like that. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6597.14s)]
*  But the kind of the one cardinal rule, the race is no motor. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6600.7s)]
*  Like the vessel has to be either wind powered, human powered, but no internal combustion [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6606.3s)]
*  or electric engines. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6612.78s)]
*  So how long is that journey? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6615.139999999999s)]
*  I think generally you could do it in a week. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6620.42s)]
*  It's about 750 miles. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6622.54s)]
*  So they changed the rules last year where so before you could only go up the inside [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6625.0199999999995s)]
*  passage like the east side of Vancouver Island. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6630.02s)]
*  And it's very constrained waterways and like currents always an issue because a lot of [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6633.02s)]
*  there's pretty big tides up there like a 12 foot tide in that part of the country is [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6642.14s)]
*  normal, you know. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6647.26s)]
*  And so you get these big tides and constrained waterways and they turn into rivers. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6649.26s)]
*  So if you don't hit the current right, hit the tide right, you know, it's you're going [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6653.540000000001s)]
*  to have to anchor up somewhere and just wait for the tide to change. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6658.26s)]
*  So there's those challenges. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6662.1s)]
*  But anyway, they changed the rules last year where you could go up the Pacific side, like [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6663.14s)]
*  just just go up the Straits of Wanda Fuqua, hang a right and just go up the Pacific. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6667.46s)]
*  So that's what I intend to do, because you'll have good wind pretty much the whole time. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6672.1s)]
*  It'd be a little sloppier, but you're not you're not going to deal with the tides and [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6677.9400000000005s)]
*  currents. You're not going to deal with the ship traffic in the inside passage. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6681.66s)]
*  You're not going to deal with like floating logs that you can hit at night. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6685.34s)]
*  There's all these like things that make it less appealing to me for sure. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6689.26s)]
*  What do you do at night in those circumstances? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6693.78s)]
*  It's pitch black outside. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6696.66s)]
*  You have no motor. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6698.42s)]
*  So I got a crew of three. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6699.860000000001s)]
*  So the the the team is called Super Nautiloid. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6704.54s)]
*  It's like a it's a reference to my favorite Black Sabbath record and like did a logo and [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6708.58s)]
*  everything. So right now. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6713.58s)]
*  In the process of refitting the boat. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6715.34s)]
*  And so it's a pretty big project. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6717.900000000001s)]
*  So right now everything's going OK, like trying to raise money, like set up a GoFundMe page [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6721.740000000001s)]
*  through the Super Nautiloid site in order to fill the gaps, you know, financially, [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6727.62s)]
*  because it is a pretty big project. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6735.1s)]
*  Been doing most of the work myself so far. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6737.18s)]
*  But yeah, the team of four, it's me, two other veterans, one friend from Ranger Battalion, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6739.1s)]
*  one friend from SF, and then I got a buddy from my Seattle Rock Days, Barrett Martin, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6745.860000000001s)]
*  who was the drummer for the Screaming Trees. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6753.34s)]
*  And he's played in a few other bands and he's actually a Grammy award winning producer, [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6755.22s)]
*  like super interesting guy. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6761.02s)]
*  Actually, you dig him. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6762.02s)]
*  You should have him on the show. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6763.06s)]
*  He's also an ethnomusicologist. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6764.660000000001s)]
*  So he's he's gone down to Peru and recorded the like shipibo shaman like Icarus, the Ayahuasca [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6767.1s)]
*  songs. And he's doing a record now like called Deep Amazon, where the concept is he has all [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6776.34s)]
*  these Icarus that he recorded down in Peru. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6785.580000000001s)]
*  And then he's bringing in various musicians to accompany these musicians. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6789.22s)]
*  So like I play on it. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6795.0199999999995s)]
*  Kim and Matt from Soundgarden play on it. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6797.9s)]
*  Peter Buck from REM plays on it. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6800.38s)]
*  So it's kind of this interesting cast of characters supporting the shipibo Icarus. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6802.86s)]
*  So the record comes out October, I guess, and any profits that are made are going to go back to [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6808.54s)]
*  the tribe. So it's kind of cool. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6815.259999999999s)]
*  That is cool. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6817.54s)]
*  So I think that's kind of the thing. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6819.0599999999995s)]
*  So how much time have you been spending sailing that you're interested in doing this? [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6820.58s)]
*  Have you dedicated a lot of your time? [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6824.18s)]
*  Yeah, like like as much free time as I can. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6825.82s)]
*  I love getting out on the boat, getting the sails up and just just going. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6828.7s)]
*  Like even just like sleeping on the boat. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6837.14s)]
*  Like when my boat was moored at this one Moreno close to my house. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6839.94s)]
*  Is that your boat? [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6844.14s)]
*  That's my boat. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6845.14s)]
*  I'm going to go back to the tribe. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6846.14s)]
*  So it's kind of cool. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6847.74s)]
*  That is cool. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6848.74s)]
*  That's my boat getting hauled out. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6849.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6852.139999999999s)]
*  So real sailboat. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6854.219999999999s)]
*  So the boat name is funny. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6855.86s)]
*  So remember when I was talking about Koala macrame. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6857.62s)]
*  So the needs bottom paint bad. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6863.38s)]
*  That's on the to do list. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6866.0599999999995s)]
*  But I've modified the name if I ever had a daughter to Gita Alexandra. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6868.099999999999s)]
*  So it's a name that at once is beautiful and strong. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6876.82s)]
*  So that was a concept. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6880.82s)]
*  But like, you know, I'm probably never going to have a daughter. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6882.82s)]
*  So do you have kids? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6884.82s)]
*  No, no kids. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6886.82s)]
*  No, no wife, no ex-wives, no kids. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6887.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6889.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6890.82s)]
*  How'd you skate through life without? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6891.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6894.82s)]
*  I mean, I guess it wasn't planned. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6895.82s)]
*  I mean, maybe on a subconscious level, just due to my childhood, I probably avoided it subconsciously. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6901.82s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people do. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6909.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6910.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6911.82s)]
*  A lot of people with traumatic childhoods or unpleasant childhoods, they say, I don't want to bring that on anybody else. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6912.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6918.82s)]
*  Because you associate what childhood is and what being a parent is with what you experienced. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6919.82s)]
*  You know, you don't think there's another way to do it. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6925.82s)]
*  But I've had friends who'd be like, oh, you'd be an awesome dad. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6929.82s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know, man. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6933.82s)]
*  And then I don't like going down that road. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6936.82s)]
*  And then it turns out like, oh, I do suck. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6939.82s)]
*  Like, you know, you talked about your flexibility. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6942.82s)]
*  You'd adjust. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6946.82s)]
*  You'd get better at it. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6947.82s)]
*  It's a strange experience. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6948.82s)]
*  It's very psychedelic. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6950.82s)]
*  Do you have kids? [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6952.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6953.82s)]
*  OK. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6954.82s)]
*  I have three daughters. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6955.82s)]
*  It seeing a little person and engaging with them and having them grow with you and learning about life. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6957.82s)]
*  And in a lot of ways, it gives you a chance to do it the right way. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6966.82s)]
*  You know, like you think about what's happened to you and you learn from that. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6970.82s)]
*  And, you know, you learn from your mistakes and raising them and you learn how to communicate with little people who are just growing and learning. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6974.82s)]
*  It's very educational. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6982.82s)]
*  It's very fascinating. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6984.82s)]
*  It's it changes you fundamentally as a human being. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6986.82s)]
*  It changes everything about you. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6990.82s)]
*  I could imagine. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6992.82s)]
*  Like, because again, going back to just the evolutionary thing, you're kind of fulfilling your mission. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6993.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6998.82s)]
*  As an organism. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=6999.82s)]
*  It did in that way. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7000.82s)]
*  Like, it really does speak to your DNA. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7002.82s)]
*  There's something about it. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7005.82s)]
*  But it's also it's like Dave Chappelle said this to me once. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7007.82s)]
*  It's a great quote. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7010.82s)]
*  He said, Becoming a father didn't just change the amount of love that I have. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7011.82s)]
*  It changed my capacity for love. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7017.82s)]
*  And I think that's very accurate. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7019.82s)]
*  But, you know, some people, their demons don't line up with that endeavor. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7023.82s)]
*  You know, they're whatever it is in their life doesn't line up with it. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7031.82s)]
*  And they don't make those adjustments because you're going to have to adjust. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7035.82s)]
*  You have to change your priorities. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7039.82s)]
*  You change. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7041.82s)]
*  You change who you are. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7042.82s)]
*  You change how you think about people. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7043.82s)]
*  It's what's fascinating with me is I always felt about people that there were these static things like, you know, I met Mike. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7045.82s)]
*  He's 70. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7054.82s)]
*  That's like he's always been 70. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7055.82s)]
*  And then you have children and raise children and see them grow from the time their little baby to a person who's having a conversation with you that you go to dinner with, you go to the movies with. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7058.82s)]
*  And, you know, all their life experiences and the good ones and the bad ones. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7072.82s)]
*  And it's just I look at people now like babies. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7077.82s)]
*  I look at everybody like they're a baby. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7081.82s)]
*  It's very weird. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7083.82s)]
*  I go wonder what you were like as a baby because you you obviously got to this point from being I see in my mind or at least I envision this journey now to get to who you are now. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7084.82s)]
*  I give people a lot more slack because of it a lot more. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7095.82s)]
*  I'm so much more charitable with people and their behavior and their attitudes because of that because I realize that a lot of what life is is determinism. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7098.82s)]
*  It's not just free will and who you are. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7109.82s)]
*  A lot of is the experiences that were thrust upon you and how you had to react to those experiences and what you were taught and who you're you know you know I have friends with horrible parents and that that battle to deal with these motherfuckers that raised you is like it's like a constant thing in their life that they never quite get past. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7112.82s)]
*  You know and I was very fortunate that my mom when she married my stepdad they're very close and they've been close most of my life. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7134.82s)]
*  So I've experienced bad and then I've also experienced like what it's like when a relationship works and when people are kind to each other and get along together and it's like so you realize like there's adjustments that everyone can make in this life. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7143.82s)]
*  To make the path smoother to make it more just you know more harmonious but I really it really changed how I think about humans like not just like my humans but all humans like everyone that I mean I really I really think of them as babies. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7163.82s)]
*  It's very strange. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7183.82s)]
*  It's very strange. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7185.82s)]
*  But I think it's kind of I sort of decided to think that way because I was recognizing like the way kids like sort of adopt your thoughts on things and my kids talk a lot of shit. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7187.82s)]
*  They're very funny because in my house we talk a lot of shit. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7201.82s)]
*  I'm always making fun of things make fun of each other and there's a lot of laughs because you know that's what I do. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7205.82s)]
*  I'm a comedian and to see my kids talk shit and say funny things it's like I know where you got that from. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7211.82s)]
*  It's very obvious but it's it's also they're very kind to which is very that makes me very proud and it's very very nice to be able to raise children in an environment where when they get older you you see them expressing the values that you appreciate and you think are important. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7220.82s)]
*  Yeah I could see and I thought not too late. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7241.82s)]
*  Yeah I guess that's the probably still got some swimmers in there the advantage of having the XY chromosome. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7245.82s)]
*  Yeah it is a big advantage you know for women you know I know women that forgot to have kids. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7251.82s)]
*  I mean I say it that way they didn't forget to have kids. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7257.82s)]
*  You know in our modern Western world and people prepare for their life they prepare for what society has established as the path that is the most celebrated which is financial success and a career that is something not just that you would be proud of but that someone would respect. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7260.82s)]
*  You know like this is Debbie she's a lawyer you know and she she's a partner at her firm like oh Debbie's happy and then you meet Debbie like oh Debbie's miserable you know she she's very successful but that it's not harmonious it's not she's not happy and that's you know it's so hard when you're in the middle of it and you're thinking so much about how other people view you and for a lot of people for whatever reason they [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7287.82s)]
*  grew up in a way that they didn't either they didn't get the respect that they deserved or they were taught that the only way to get respect or the only way to be appreciated or not feel like a failure is to be financially successful but some of the biggest failures that I know are financially successful. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7316.82s)]
*  Some of the biggest messes of a life that I know are people that on paper are winners and they're not they're just a disaster and they're they're filled with nonsense and they you know they don't value human experiences and love and camaraderie and creativity and education and just. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7334.82s)]
*  Just. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7355.82s)]
*  Just extracting the most fun and the most satisfying life out of this experience instead there you know they're concentrating on money they want to talk to you about numbers and expansion and you know are you investing and I have a business I'd like you to be a part of and there's a this and then that and I was like. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7357.82s)]
*  And you don't realize that it's gonna fucking end man and you don't realize that I think sometimes until someone close to you does die and then you go oh this is so temporary and I'm not enjoying this process at all and one of the things that I'm getting out of talking to you is that you have sought out these. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7380.82s)]
*  Not these difficult but educational experiences and that's what makes someone fascinating that's what makes someone cool to talk to you know the path of the most boring people to talk to for the people that are just thinking about making money they're so fucking boring. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7400.82s)]
*  It's so brutal talking to them is that just they have this very narrow thing that they're obsessed with and that thing gives them social status when someone sees them it's like oh there's bill the millionaire you know he's got he owns his company and this this that and that bills right about to have a fucking heart attack and he's like got very little time left and doesn't even realize and he's taken out of all day to try to keep up and. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7419.82s)]
*  You know doing cocaine and cheating on his wife and fucking flying on jets everywhere and it looks on paper like he's the man but meanwhile he's a disaster and there's a lot of people like that. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7443.82s)]
*  Yeah I agree with you I think. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7453.82s)]
*  I was fortunate enough to start figuring out that stuff at a relatively young age where. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7458.82s)]
*  I made the shift and I think it's a very human thing to want external validation yes you know for sure like we're we're social creatures were these tribal creatures like we want the other people in the tribe to you know. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7467.82s)]
*  Go yeah. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7484.82s)]
*  But. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7486.82s)]
*  I think the internal validation at least for me. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7488.82s)]
*  Were like basically in a I don't mean this like in a malignant way but like when you kind of stop caring what other people think about you. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7492.82s)]
*  And focus more on what you think about yourself. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7504.82s)]
*  Like for me that was like a huge shift like a huge like. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7508.82s)]
*  Like giving up like doing things that like. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7512.82s)]
*  I thought that other people think was cool you know right that's what a lot of people do right yeah a lot of us do and I certainly have been guilty of that my wife. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7516.82s)]
*  Well every we all have like I have to like it's it's human it's not and it's not that big a dig and maybe there's a balance but then it's like. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7525.82s)]
*  As soon as I figured out like like that internal validation was meant everything to me and the external was just it was fluff you know yeah it was this vapid thing that. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7533.82s)]
*  At the end of the day wasn't satisfying at all there's some satisfaction the respect of people that you respect yeah for sure yeah when you you see this person's an exception. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7545.82s)]
*  Person and they enjoy being with you like oh maybe I'm okay. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7554.82s)]
*  And like going I mean there's actually a couple things I'd like to go back to with like what you're talking about and one was like. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7558.82s)]
*  Like the in reference to parents like I don't maybe I'll view them as babies now but like as soon as I you know it's probably my late twenties where I started like. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7565.82s)]
*  Viewing them as as human beings and like imperfect creatures like we all are yeah and like like. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7577.82s)]
*  All of a sudden I had all this empathy for them you know yeah and there's a quote and I think it's attributed to play dough but I don't think it's him I think it's more of like a 19th century thing but. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7584.82s)]
*  It's more of like a 19th century thing but it's go something like be kind for everyone is fighting their own battle and so like I apply that to like people apply to myself you know yeah it's like I'm definitely fighting my battle still. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7596.82s)]
*  Yeah you know I'm figuring some shit out but it's not over I'm sure I'm sure it never will be it never will be yeah I don't I don't imagine it ever is. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7611.82s)]
*  But you know the process is interesting and obviously breakthroughs are interesting. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7619.82s)]
*  But the other point. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7624.82s)]
*  Yeah just the empathy for others working on yourself like there there's an evil Knievel quote. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7630.82s)]
*  And I'm gonna have to paraphrase because I can't remember it exactly but he's like you know when I was young I cared about what other people thought but now that I'm old I just care about what I think like. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7638.82s)]
*  And it's like it's kind of the same thing it's like yeah and yeah obviously I care what other people at least the people I care about I want them to think that I'm a decent person right or you know that's normal yeah and. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7648.82s)]
*  Again going back to another thing you're talking about is like the most important thing in my life these days. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7661.82s)]
*  Yeah you know our personal relationships yeah it's like I'm at the point now where you know and I'm sure you do the same thing you curate your tribe right. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7669.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7680.82s)]
*  And like these relationships are like so rewarding and so honestly that's where I extract the most joy in my life from is these personal relationships yeah that's the what I'm most protective of to most protective of those people but also protective of not allowing anyone else in the tribe that I do. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7681.82s)]
*  Don't think you have to you have to curate the tribe yeah you have to be very careful about that because I know so many people that have been involved in friendships and relationships with people that are just disastrous and they it's like a drowning person you try to help them and you drown to. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7699.82s)]
*  You know some people just will fucking drag you in and other people's they'll elevate you and you know it's obviously not they're not perfect experiences we're all human but through even mistakes and then the reconciling of those mistakes and the communication through that. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7715.82s)]
*  It's an educational experience for everybody involved and everyone is sort of on the same sort of path in the sense where you're trying to be a better version of who you are you're trying to be a better person and you know that might be being a better parent or being a better friend or being a better artist or whatever whatever it is you're trying to do. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7737.82s)]
*  But it really benefits you to be around other people that are also trying to do that thing too because you know one of the beautiful things about for me about having this podcast is being able to communicate with so many interesting people and being able to have these conversations like we're having right now where I get to just met you today you know but get a sense of your journey and your life and I think about it through your eyes and through your perspective and it educates me and I think that's what I'm trying to do. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7759.82s)]
*  I think it educates a lot of the people that are listening and it'll resonate with them like I kind of see where this guy's coming from and it all it just expands our landscape of understanding. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7789.82s)]
*  Yeah I mean that's ultimately we're trying to like the word harmonious I've used it too many times probably but that's really what it is like you just you're not it's not going to be great all the time but it's you want it to be as harmonious as possible and you want to enjoy as much of it as possible. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7801.82s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah and some sometimes like with you and what you did it's like embracing things that are really fucking difficult and through that you get an understanding of yourself that's really not available to someone who doesn't go through struggle. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7817.82s)]
*  That's the intent for sure. Yeah with no again it's that punctuated equilibrium if there's not a traumatic a stressor say you're not you're not going to grow. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7832.82s)]
*  You're just going to flatline and like maybe there's no negativity there but there's also no positivity. Right. You're just dull. And I think that's the problem with a lot of people today and why they're medicated is that they're not experiencing life in a way that seems to resonate with them in a positive manner. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7847.82s)]
*  It's just not doesn't seem right. Seems it seems shitty and depressing. You know I had this conversation with a buddy of mine the other day where he was talking about stages of his life where he was very depressed and we came to this conclusion but but during that time your life sucked and now your life is pretty cool. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7869.82s)]
*  And of course you're happier and that seems so simplistic to some people. But a lot of that I mean there's what without a doubt there's clinical depression there's people that have something wrong. There's an imbalance whether it's a physical imbalance or a life imbalance or a trauma that they can't get over. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7887.82s)]
*  But my friends that I know that have had those dark moments in their life when their life turned around now they're in a great relationship. Now they have good friends. Now they live in a good community. Those people are fucking happier. They they're doing a thing that they want to do with their life. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7905.82s)]
*  Those people are happier and that's a thing that we we have this this sort of binary view of what happiness is. And for some people it's like oh I need to get on an SSRI. I need to get on this or that or I need to do something. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7922.82s)]
*  I need to you know some sort of chemical intervention to straighten out my head. That's not always the case. Like sometimes it's just you got to get through that and come out on the other side and figure out what is the process of becoming a more fulfilled person. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7943.82s)]
*  What's the process of living a harmonious life. Like how do I do that. Like what is the thing. And I think we get a lot of the answers to that from talking to people and from listening to people talk about it and then from trying things and learning and growing. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7962.82s)]
*  And that's something we're not that's not the son of a public narrative. It's not something that's being discussed. It's not something that's drilled in the kids heads like you. You're going to go through some shit but you've got to trust in this process and you've got to have you have to have guidelines in your mind of what you want to do. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7977.82s)]
*  You have to have ethics and morals. You have to have compassion for other people because if you think it's all about you you're never going to be happy. You're never ever going to be happy. The narcissist and the people that are like deeply connected to their own wants and needs. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=7998.82s)]
*  They always get out of that feeling hollow and empty. And you know those are the people that are you know doing blow all the time and just trying to find some sort of external method of elevating their diversion. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8015.82s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Okay. If I do this I'm not going to think about the important stuff. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Like the whole I've always been intrigued by the the Greek or ancient Greek notion of like human flourishing. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8029.82s)]
*  Like the Greeks called it eudaimonia. And it's this is being you know endeavoring to be the best that you can be whatever that is. And it's not talking about vocation or external stuff. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8044.82s)]
*  But you use a person like figuring out I mean everything we've been talking about like figuring out what brings you joy applying yourself. And it's hard. You know it's like if it were easy. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8062.82s)]
*  And I've had this discussion with other friends were you know about human flourishing and stuff and like and this is going to sound a little bit negative. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8075.82s)]
*  But I think there's a lot of people who can't be bothered you know who are fully capable of flourishing if they applied themselves. Right. And for whatever reason just it's easier to do this. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8084.82s)]
*  I think they'd also don't have the tools like they'd never like you got to think about like your life at a young age you sort of sought out those journeys when you can. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8096.82s)]
*  And some people they don't develop those tools they fall into a system that's very unserving for them whether it's a system of you know getting an education then you have student debt student loan debt. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8106.82s)]
*  And then so you have to get a job and then you get a job that pays well because you have to pay off that debt and then you buy a house. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8119.82s)]
*  So now you have a mortgage and you have a family so now you have responsibilities and you have all these things. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8125.82s)]
*  But most of your day is spent doing something you absolutely don't want to do but is also not rewarding. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8129.82s)]
*  There's a lot of things you don't want to do. But when you do them you're like God damn I'm glad I did that. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8137.82s)]
*  Very few people who are doing a nine to five or longer job that they don't want to do have that feeling. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8141.82s)]
*  There's just just a lot of you know it's like that Thoreau quote most men live lives of quiet desperation. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8149.82s)]
*  Yeah. That is so fucking true. And unless you find something that is satisfying and something that elevates you something that with these experiences you gain insight into the world. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8155.82s)]
*  And if you don't you just become this fever minded capitalist where you just are constantly chasing numbers because it's rewarded by society that external validation that you get from driving a Mercedes. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8170.82s)]
*  That thing that you get from having a nice house where people drive by and go look at that. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8184.82s)]
*  Yeah. Someone you don't even know. Yeah. Like that's important to you what that person thinks. Sure. And that's what a lot of people like right. They like to wear jewelry and look flashy. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8187.82s)]
*  So when they show up everybody goes wow look at him look at her look at them. You know wow they got the thing. They got the thing. They got the thing. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8196.82s)]
*  They got that those sneakers that I can't buy. They got that fucking that watch that I can't wear. Look at those glasses. Those are expensive. You know like we live in this bizarre society where that is rewarded or at least highlighted so often in so many people's lives. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8203.82s)]
*  You know we don't realize that that's not going to bring you the joy that you're looking for. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8219.82s)]
*  Or you get that short term fix but it evaporates instantly and it's like you're constantly chasing the dragon. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's the thing. It's like you're constantly chasing the dragon. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8224.82s)]
*  I was reading about this Russian oligarch that they confiscated his yachts and he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And he's got this one yacht that's fucking insane. And [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8233.82s)]
*  they confiscated another he's got the second yacht that's just as preposterous maybe even more so that operates on massive batteries so it can literally drive as silent as a Tesla. It's you know, fucking hundreds of feet long and like, that's that world that you get into, like of constantly keeping up with the Joneses and all the other people. It's like it never ends. It never ends. You get to the highest levels of it all and it never ends. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8263.82s)]
*  It's a series of false summits. It's like I've arrived. Oh, wait a minute. No, I haven't. Yeah. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8291.9s)]
*  That's a great way to put it. A series of false summits. It's all illusions. It's all mirage. Yeah. And then one day he's dead. That's it. And then all the people around him are like, that guy was a fucking asshole. And that's a fucking disaster to die a multi-billionaire who was a fucking asshole who everybody hated. It's so strange. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8296.5s)]
*  So much wasted potential. Yeah. But there's so many people that are just chasing it. I saw this image of Rupert Murdoch with his wife and he was on the beach and he literally looks like an alien. He's just he's just like these bones and tissue and fat. And he's with this woman. And they were supposed to get married and didn't work out. And he was but he was one of the things he was saying. He's in his 90s. It was like I don't know which wife he's on. Right. But. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8321.38s)]
*  He was saying that I'm looking forward to spending the second half of my life with her like hey bro what do you know that I don't know. You got about a month left. You know I mean if everything goes great you might have eight years if everything goes great. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8351.46s)]
*  But no one thinks about that while you're in the middle of it. All you're thinking about is you know keeping that fucking game going that thing that's gotten you all that those accolades a thing that's gotten you all those that respect. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8371.46s)]
*  And it's just numbers just like dopamine hits like it's like checking your social media forever to the end of time checking the likes on your fucking Instagram post to the end of time. It's like it's empty. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8385.699999999999s)]
*  And that's the path that so many people are on. You know I just don't understand it. I'll never understand it. But I get it. You know I get how you get sucked into that path. Yeah I totally understand the mechanism. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8398.82s)]
*  The mechanism. Yeah. And it's just like it's like it hijacks the human reward systems of you being like the leader of the tribe. But the leader of the tribe used to be the wise old warrior who had made the mistakes and proven his character and his metal and combat and then life and and had wisdom to impart on the others and could lead the tribe in a way that. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8412.94s)]
*  It could help these people and protect them. That just doesn't exist anymore. It's been hijacked by this system of monetary gain. It's fucking weird. And obviously it's very easy for me to say as someone who gets external external validation and someone who makes money it's easy for me to say because I've sort of removed myself from the hunger of that in a way so I can go oh OK. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8437.14s)]
*  I see what this is. You know I've never been very motivated by money. I've certainly pursued it but it's also not been anything that meant the most to me. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8462.900000000001s)]
*  Money's freedom. Yeah that's the way I look at it. Yes it's like it it opens options. Yes. But like money for the sake of money like forget it. It can allow you to pursue things that make you happy. Yeah. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8475.220000000001s)]
*  But you have to know what it is and it's not being taught. You know I think about the things that are being taught. I mean perhaps they teach it a little bit of philosophy but most of the time if you are trying to get an education you try to get an education to get a job. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8488.58s)]
*  I mean that's the way it's geared towards now. Yeah. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8504.94s)]
*  It's not like the ancient Greeks where education was like here's how you live a good and virtuous life. Yeah. But the people that I've talked to that are the most boring are the ones that are just pursuing money. The people that I've talked to the most fascinating are the ones that are trying to figure it out. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8508.38s)]
*  And they're they've accumulated a lot of lessons and a lot of information and they can talk about things and I can get something out of that conversation. I can go oh I see how this guy thinks. I see how we got there. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8524.38s)]
*  Life's so profoundly weird but it's just so cool. It's very cool. You know or it sucks depending on where you are and what you're stuck in. You know and some of it is beyond your control. Some of it is determinism. Some of it is your environment. Some of it is a shitty roll of the dice and you're working in a coal ball mine in the Congo. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8536.74s)]
*  There's a lot of that to it but and some people they transcend that. They figure their way out of that. And it's the hardest journey. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8556.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah it's like the money thing. There's been a couple of occasions where like I've had people reach out to me. I don't know 20 years ago like a friend of mine from the music days was like hey [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8566.82s)]
*  there's this Nirvana record that came out. It's like a collection of B sides and bits and pieces that I guess the label put out to make some money. And they're like hey you play on a couple of songs. You're probably owed some money. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8581.5s)]
*  And I'm like I started thinking about it and I'm like [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8595.98s)]
*  like hire an attorney. Like what? Sue the label? Sue the band? And like no. For money that I'm sure is not life changing. And even if it even if it was the process just made me so tired that it was like. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8598.82s)]
*  More recently something similar happened with Soundgarden. Like someone close to the band said hey there's these Soundgarden box sets that are out and you play on a couple of songs. Like you're probably owed some money. And the same thing is like no I'm not even going to start down that path. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8614.82s)]
*  Yeah because even if it did make you money it would probably rob you of some happiness. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8636.82s)]
*  No just let it go. It's like you know. It's like I mean I guess it kind of sucks that like whoever like the bean counters at the label are like fuck that guy. You know but OK. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8640.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8655.82s)]
*  That's fine. I'll be all right. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8657.82s)]
*  You got something from that no matter what. You can't put it in you know a bank account but it's what you got from that is invaluable. It's like you were there. You have that it changed you as a person. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8659.82s)]
*  Yeah it's like that experience. Yeah it's a it's a I mean at this point it's not a huge component of who I am but it was definitely necessary steps on on this journey. And I'm glad I'm so glad things turned out the way they did. You know like I never look back and go I wish you know I was this like rich rock guy. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8673.82s)]
*  And on so many levels I'm glad that I didn't. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8697.82s)]
*  Oh yeah yeah I know a few. I know a few too. Yeah. That's the saddest thing in the world. It's when you meet a miserable success. Even rock stars even someone who's an artist right. And for some so many of them they're only happy when they're on top. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8700.82s)]
*  And it's not even necessarily happy. It's like euphoria. There's like a thing about it like oh my god I'm the fucking man. You know look at me. I got the long hair and the fucking guitar and everybody loves me and just yeah it's almost a trap. It's almost like a gilded cage that you're you're part of. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8717.82s)]
*  Look at me. Yeah. Yeah just like it would be cool to have that financial security and then do something totally different. Right. You know yeah. It's it's also a trap and you know the trap of fame. It's like you really it's hard to know people. It's hard to get to know people because everybody's approaching you in a very alien way. I mean that was when when I first got into the band I was like oh yeah. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8740.82s)]
*  I mean that was when I was young and obviously not on that huge level but that was kind of when I got fired from Soundgarden that was kind of part of the crisis where I was like it was easy to put on the identity of like being the bass player for Soundgarden. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8767.82s)]
*  You know and like I was like the de facto cool guy. Sure. And like a conversation with someone at dinner. What do you do. I'm the bass player for Soundgarden. You know like women would show interest. You know and I you know especially being like a painfully shy young man. That was awesome. You know but then it was like when I did have that taken away and it did it did knock me for a loop for a bit but it also helped me recognize like oh I should just focus on. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8786.82s)]
*  Jason the dude. You know not not Jason the bass player for Soundgarden. Right. And that's kind of that was kind of the slap in the face that kind of brought me around. But you had to go through that. Yeah. Yeah. But that's the thing about going through something that sucks. Like when you get on the other end of it and you achieve equilibrium you go OK. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8817.82s)]
*  It was actually probably good for me. I wholeheartedly believe I came out the other end better on every level. And like Mike I'm happier now at 55 than I've ever been in my entire life. And each year gets better. You know that's success. Yeah. So yeah exactly. That's the way I look at it. Yeah. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8839.82s)]
*  Why did you want to do this. Do what. This podcast. I'm going to be honest to give my R2A case I some oxygen. Your the race to Alaska. Oh OK. But also you know I'm a fan. I think the first podcast I listened to you was the one you did with James from Metallica. Oh that was great. The beekeeping. Yeah. So cool. Yeah he's very cool. He's an interesting guy. Yeah I knew him a little bit back in the day. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8860.82s)]
*  But yeah the beekeeping stuff was fascinating. Yeah I got connected to him through my friend Jim Brewer Jim Brewer who's a long time he's been my friend for the comedian. Yeah yeah he opens for Metallica. OK. Which is hilarious because he's a giant Metallica fan and he doesn't need to do that. And I think they just offered it to him because they're friends with him. And like he decided that'd be a fun thing to do. And since he's such a Metallica fan he speaks to those people. It's not like. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8890.82s)]
*  Just a regular comedian opening for a band they're not interested in and the crowd doesn't engage. He talks about Metallica and he has material. Jim is one of the most prolific and interesting guys that I know in terms of like his stand up. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8921.58s)]
*  Like he can just Jim can like something can happen in the news today and Jim can go on stage and do like 10 minutes on it and just rant and rave and he's such a fucking cartoonish character. He's so funny. So watching him open for Metallica is a fucking hoot. It's so hilarious because he's in his element and he's also a brilliant comedian and just such a character. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8937.88s)]
*  And so he reached out to me. He's like hey man you should have James Halfield on. He's fucking awesome. Fucking be a great podcast. I was like let's do it. Let's do it. You know so having him on was pretty pretty cool. Yeah. So that was my gateway to your show. And that put the hooks in me. It's like OK this is good. Well thanks man. Appreciate it. I'm glad we did this too. So let's tell everybody about your site. So maybe we can get that goal. I mean we already talked about it. Well how do I get to it. Like what is what's the website. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8962.44s)]
*  So the website's super not a Lloyd dot com super not a low. Yeah one word so super. So it's a play on Black Sabbath super not right. But the not a Lloyd is like the the prehistoric marine creature. So what is it. It's like a squid with a shell. OK super not a Lloyd race to Alaska 2023. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=8992.44s)]
*  Yep. Nice. OK so soon super not a lot dot com and the link to the go fund me is up there as well. Yeah down the page. Are you going to document this at all on either social media or on YouTube or anything like that. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9015.64s)]
*  So Barrett has a buddy who's a documentary filmmaker who he's going to do some stuff on it. So like maybe if like enough people kick in like five or 10 bucks we actually pay Tad to do a documentary because he's a professional he's not an amateur. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9029.8s)]
*  So it's going to cost some money to have it done right. But Tad's interested in doing it. I think he just needs to be remunerated proper properly in order to complete the project. But yeah that's been talked about and it may happen. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9051.4s)]
*  Well maybe we can make it happen. So the other thing that I would say to you is I think you should write a book. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9069.6s)]
*  So I can tell a story about my my brush with the literary world. OK sure. So I actually I was at this juncture another juncture basically before I went to grad school and I was like maybe maybe I should write a book you know. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9075.68s)]
*  Maybe it's time or whatever. And actually I got an agent and I wrote a book proposal actually wrote the proposal when I was in Buenos Aires. And I remember sitting in this cafe in Buenos Aires so it's like winter time down there and it's pouring down rain and there's like water leaking from the roof and there's pots and pans around the cafe like catching the rainwater. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9100.76s)]
*  And on my laptop and I'm finishing the proposal and it's like cool when I get back to the States I'll meet with the agent and you know and like there was so many parallels. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9126.359999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you've been in that world too with the literary world like the business side of it. And with that in the music world. So he this agent's promising me the world you know like the classic like music is saying like you know you boys are going to be bigger than [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9140.039999999999s)]
*  Led Zepp you know kind of thing. Yeah. And I'm taking it with a grain of salt. I'm like OK you know I'm being pretty moderate about the whole thing. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9155.8s)]
*  So I finished the proposal and I thought it was decent you know gave it to him and then got another meeting with him and some other dude. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9164.32s)]
*  And they're they're like sands you know kind of making these radical [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9176.0s)]
*  Suggestions as far as like changing the thrust of the narrative and things like that. I'd be open to like tweaking it but like you know if it's my book it's going to be my vision. You know like any any creative project. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9180.140000000001s)]
*  And then they started suggesting like a co writer which is this code for a ghost writer. Right. And it's like you know I'm not I'm not Hemingway but I think I can put some sentences together. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9193.54s)]
*  According to other people who told me that who know these things and [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9205.06s)]
*  So basically I got accepted to grad school and I got a Tillman scholarship that paid for grad school and it's like OK I'm going to grad school and put the book on the back burner but um it'll probably happen someday. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9210.859999999999s)]
*  I would suggest that you just write it. Yeah. And then try to sell it. I've had other people suggest that as well. Yeah I think that's the only way to do it. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9225.38s)]
*  I tried to do it the other way a long time ago and I had a disastrous I'm not giving the money back. I just had a couple of conversations with them. I don't want to do it like this. Yeah. Like no done. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9233.14s)]
*  It was just wasn't what I wanted to do. You know what I wanted to do is just write what I was thinking about stuff. And they had this very specific idea that they they had a package that they wanted to fit into. I was like totally similar to my idea. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9245.18s)]
*  Yeah I mean that's what they do. You know it's like it's like the scorpion and the frog right. It's in my nature. Yeah it's just what they do. Yeah. Yeah. Well listen brother I really appreciate it man. I really enjoyed our conversation. Thank you very much. Yeah thank you. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9262.14s)]
*  And good luck and don't fall in the water. Have a good time doing that. We'll be very safe. Like that like that. I was reading the safety regulations and it's like this isn't very hippie dippy. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9278.38s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. Do you have any social media or anything like that. You can tell people about just that. Just that. And I created the site myself. It's my first foray into that world at all. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9289.3s)]
*  Looks professional. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9299.9s)]
*  It's like one page. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9302.46s)]
*  That's all you need. I did design the super not a logo which I'm kind of proud of. It's like I don't know if you're familiar with black Sabbath volume for sure. Yes. My favorite Sabbath record one of my favorite records. So it's an homage to that. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9305.66s)]
*  Obviously. So I kind of mixed in like Sabbath and maritime and. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9317.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Cool. All right. Well again I really enjoyed this. Thanks. Thanks for doing this. Appreciate it. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9323.54s)]
*  You're welcome. I enjoyed it very much. Cool. Thanks everybody. Bye. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYQvlTnT4QM&t=9329.18s)]
