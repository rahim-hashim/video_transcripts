# Joe Rogan Experience #1948 - Tony Hinchcliffe & Brian Redban
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=0.0s)]
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6.0s)]
*  Brian, you got every kind of caffeinated beverage known to man in front of you. What do you got? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=10.0s)]
*  I got a smoothie and black rifle. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=16.0s)]
*  Two black rifles and then you got a cooler. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=19.0s)]
*  Oh, this is liquid IV. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=21.0s)]
*  Oh, look at you trying to stay hydrated. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=22.0s)]
*  I got Factor, I got Liquid IV, I got all the sponsors. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=24.0s)]
*  You are made remarkably healthy. Out of all the people I was worried about during COVID, it was you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=27.0s)]
*  I was worried about you and Tim Dillon. You were my number one and number two. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=32.0s)]
*  But you fucking coasted through like it was nothing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=35.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. My doctor said I have this thing where my metabolism is too strong and it's like fucking my gums up right now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=37.0s)]
*  Your metabolism is fucking your gums up? What kind of doctor? You go to a chiropractor? You go to a witch doctor? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=47.0s)]
*  No, I've actually been to like all the two dent dentists now because I'm dealing with it right now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=53.0s)]
*  It's fucking my gums are like gum disease type receding gums. Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=58.0s)]
*  And so I have to get a deep clean. But I'm there. Let me use nitrous for the first time at a doctor. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=62.0s)]
*  I've never done that. Have you done nitrous at a doctor? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=67.0s)]
*  It's fun. Really? Yeah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=69.0s)]
*  How silly do you get? You haven't done it yet? Have you done it? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I ended up like being mean to the dentist. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=73.0s)]
*  I was like making jokes that weren't funny. Like nobody was laughing. Oh, no. Yeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=76.0s)]
*  That's what I'm scared of. Because, you know, in college you do it and you fall out a window. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=81.0s)]
*  You start like fishing around and shit. How are you going to do that at a dentist when they're trying to be precise with your teeth? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=84.0s)]
*  That's a good point. Right. Like you got to take a wild chance that the person is out of their fucking mind. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=91.0s)]
*  If you're going to dose them up with nitrous. I don't know what it feels like. Is that the same thing with whippets? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=95.0s)]
*  Oh, we can find out real quick. It is. It's medical grade. We have them here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=100.0s)]
*  Yeah. I already did whippets on the show. We're like, what are you doing? I was like, is this even legal? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=105.0s)]
*  No. He has. He bought them somewhere. Like you could buy whippets. You could buy it for those machines for the whipped cream. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=110.0s)]
*  Whippets for whipped cream. Yeah. That's just whipped cream. That's what they call it. Yeah. They call them whippets. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=117.0s)]
*  But I thought for whipped cream you get like a large one. Well, that was just when I worked in a restaurant. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=120.0s)]
*  Well, the container is large, but then you unscrew the top and it's just a little nitrous thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=124.0s)]
*  Dude, I worked at a Newport Creamery in Massachusetts and everybody did whippets. I'm pretty sure I did it once. I must have done it once. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=128.0s)]
*  I was like 15, 15, 16. I think I worked there and people just go back there and get blasted off whippets. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=135.0s)]
*  Damn. How did Argue react to it? He just started laughing, like couldn't stop laughing and threw his head back. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=141.0s)]
*  He's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's what he said. It was like, it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Norman hated it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=149.0s)]
*  Norman did it. He's like, fuck this. This is terrible. I feel awful. I feel like I died. I don't like it at all. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=154.0s)]
*  He was not interested. Seeing Norman, I was like, I'm not doing it. If he's reacting like that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=161.0s)]
*  I might think. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=166.0s)]
*  It's just, and then we looked up all the possible things that could happen to you and like, oh, there's a lot. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=167.0s)]
*  There's a lot of things that could go wrong. You're not supposed to do that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=171.0s)]
*  It fries your brain cells too. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=175.0s)]
*  Well, they said that's a thing with amyl nitrate. Amyl nitrate is poppers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=176.0s)]
*  And apparently it's big in the gay community with gay dudes who like to party. I don't know if it's still, but at one point in time. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=181.0s)]
*  It is. We love it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=187.0s)]
*  They would take a male nitrate and somehow or another it helped them relax during sex. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=190.0s)]
*  Something I don't remember what the but apparently amyl nitrate is really bad for you. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=195.0s)]
*  Like destroys your immune system, destroys you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=201.0s)]
*  Like it's really bad. It gives you brain damage. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=204.0s)]
*  You know, it doesn't seem like, you know, there's some drugs that people will defend. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=207.0s)]
*  You know, they'll talk about the beauty of heroin. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=211.0s)]
*  Like there's no one out there defending amyl nitrate. No one's like, it's the shit. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=213.0s)]
*  Like it's changed my life. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=218.0s)]
*  Started doing amyl. Got my fucking garage cleaned. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=219.0s)]
*  At least people who do speed, they get things done. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=223.0s)]
*  You know, like people who do speed, they don't want to fucking organize the garage. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=227.0s)]
*  Putting shelves up and stuff. Cleaning everything. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=230.0s)]
*  I need that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=234.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's an adderall thing apparently. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=235.0s)]
*  People do adderall and they start cleaning shit and organizing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=238.0s)]
*  Not my thing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=241.0s)]
*  Yeah. Have you fucked with adderall at all? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=242.0s)]
*  Couple of times. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=244.0s)]
*  What about you? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=245.0s)]
*  No. They had me on Ritalin when I was a kid. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=246.0s)]
*  Oh, that figures everything out. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=248.0s)]
*  All the time. Every day. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=250.0s)]
*  Ritalin's an upper, right? Or downer, I mean. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=252.0s)]
*  I think it's an upper. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=254.0s)]
*  Well, it's an upper, but supposedly back then they said that if you had ADD it brings you down. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=255.0s)]
*  Like it's supposed to mellow you out, but I hated it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=259.0s)]
*  You know, who talked about that is Henry Rollins. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=262.0s)]
*  Talked about it when he was a kid. They put him on that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=264.0s)]
*  He was like five years old. He had him on it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=266.0s)]
*  He was just all the time like fucking grrr. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=268.0s)]
*  And the way he describes it is like, oh, when you see Henry, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=271.0s)]
*  like he's so intense, like everything about him is intense. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=275.0s)]
*  Even the things he enjoys, like when he talks about like listening to records. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=278.0s)]
*  He's so intense. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=283.0s)]
*  It's like they just cranked his fucking brain up to ten when he was a little kid. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=284.0s)]
*  Which is wild because you can kind of, I mean, it's not a thing to do. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=290.0s)]
*  I'm not saying you should do it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=296.0s)]
*  But what I'm saying is you can manipulate a child's mind with those things in a way. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=297.0s)]
*  Like you're you have to be you're changing their reality, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=303.0s)]
*  You're changing the way they experience things. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=306.0s)]
*  That's got to change their view of life overall in general. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=308.0s)]
*  Like if your view of life over like, you know, how stoners are some stoners. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=313.0s)]
*  They're it's abusive. They're abusive. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=317.0s)]
*  They're so high all the time that they're just like not making sense. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=320.0s)]
*  They like never make any sense. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=324.0s)]
*  Like if you're doing that all the time when you're like 14, 15, 16, which some kids do. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=325.0s)]
*  That shit's terrible for you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=332.0s)]
*  It doesn't prepare you for life at all. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=334.0s)]
*  Like being a fucking full timer when you're like 14, like, whoa, like to regular reality is hard enough. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=337.0s)]
*  You're trying to figure out what the fuck is life. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=344.0s)]
*  What are what is a grown up? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=347.0s)]
*  You know, what is a job? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=348.0s)]
*  Like when does this start? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=350.0s)]
*  When is this I need to get a job thing start? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=351.0s)]
*  Do you remember that feeling like the high school feeling like when do I need to be able to take care of myself? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=353.0s)]
*  Terrifying, terrifying feeling. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=358.0s)]
*  And nobody prepares you for it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=361.0s)]
*  Nobody prepares you for this idea that you're going to have to take care of yourself. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=363.0s)]
*  Like what? What? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=366.0s)]
*  I have to pay my own bills. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=368.0s)]
*  I have to get a job. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=369.0s)]
*  What do I do? I don't know what to do. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=371.0s)]
*  And everybody's like, you got to go to college. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=373.0s)]
*  I guess I got to go to college. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=375.0s)]
*  I don't want to be a fucking loser. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=376.0s)]
*  I got to go to college. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=378.0s)]
*  Remember those days? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=379.0s)]
*  I can remember days like when I would work like three different kind of jobs. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=381.0s)]
*  I'd like deliver newspapers, drive limos. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=385.0s)]
*  And I would do, you know, occasionally I'd do construction. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=388.0s)]
*  If something came up and I could get away with doing it during the day. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=392.0s)]
*  But I was always tired. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=395.0s)]
*  I hated those jobs. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=396.0s)]
*  But I was like, fuck, what do I do? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=398.0s)]
*  Like I was trying to figure out what to do. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=400.0s)]
*  And if stand up, if I didn't find stand up. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=402.0s)]
*  Oh, my God, I've been so fucked. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=404.0s)]
*  I would have been so fucked. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=407.0s)]
*  I've been so fucked because my brain was not wired for jobs. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=411.0s)]
*  You know, some people can do it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=415.0s)]
*  Some people are awesome at it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=418.0s)]
*  Some people, they lock into a career and they're very happy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=419.0s)]
*  You know, but for whatever it was, like with my childhood, man, my childhood was just too chaotic. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=423.0s)]
*  I did not have any desire to be like in any sort of order or I'm like locked in. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=429.0s)]
*  I was a latchkey kid. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=435.0s)]
*  Like my parents just kind of let me out of the house. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=436.0s)]
*  Go have fun. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=438.0s)]
*  And like kids like that have zero desire for order. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=439.0s)]
*  Like you're out there wild and these other fucking 10 year olds out in the street lighting buildings on fire accidentally and finding fireworks. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=443.0s)]
*  And we did wild shit. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=451.0s)]
*  We were kids totally. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=452.0s)]
*  That is not prepare you for an office job that prepares you for sitting in class going, fuck, I got to get out of here. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=453.0s)]
*  Dude, my kid told me on Tick Tock, she found this thing that was explaining how our educational system was developed. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=461.0s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=469.0s)]
*  I go, you got this on Tick Tock? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=470.0s)]
*  I go, what did you find out? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=472.0s)]
*  And she was like, it was developed to turn people who are like these rural people into factory workers. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=473.0s)]
*  Like they were literally like gearing education when they started public education to like prepare these like wild folk. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=480.0s)]
*  They put them in factories. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=488.0s)]
*  If you think about like the kind of people that were alive, that were living in like rural Columbus, Ohio, like outside of Columbus, in where you guys are from in like the 1900s. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=490.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=503.0s)]
*  What were those people like the farm people, like the people that were basically just like the pioneers? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=504.0s)]
*  They just stopped and they developed a small town. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=509.0s)]
*  And in like 1903, if you're in that fucking town and they want to take one of those people and turn them into an office worker. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=512.0s)]
*  Like good luck. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=519.0s)]
*  The Youngstown was the number one steel producing city in the world through the like 30s, 40s, 50s. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=521.0s)]
*  And then one Monday it all closed. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=527.0s)]
*  So like everything that even it was built around was fucked completely. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=529.0s)]
*  Like everything that their work ethic, everything was just always go to high school and then you work in the steel mill. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=536.0s)]
*  Your dad worked in the steel mill, his dad. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=541.0s)]
*  How old were you when this was going down? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=544.0s)]
*  It was before I was born. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=546.0s)]
*  But the dilapidation that it left, left this. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=547.0s)]
*  Well, you can't there was no like you can go chase your dreams. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=550.0s)]
*  You can move to L.A. or New York. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=554.0s)]
*  Like that's all stuff that you had to like find out on your own. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=556.0s)]
*  Nobody, no teacher was like you could do anything. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=559.0s)]
*  It was it was bleak. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=563.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=565.0s)]
*  Isn't that horrible? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=566.0s)]
*  It's such a bad vibe. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=567.0s)]
*  It's such a bad vibe for a child to grow up in that kind of a shattered dream vibe like a Detroit, Michigan, after the factories got pulled out of there. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=569.0s)]
*  Like that Flint, Michigan documentary that Michael Moore did, Roger and me is amazing. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=580.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=585.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=586.0s)]
*  To me, that's his best work because that was a young Roger who was trying to like figure out like what the fuck was going on to this place where he was from. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=587.0s)]
*  And so it was so real. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=596.0s)]
*  And he was so young in it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=598.0s)]
*  It was it was really like what year was Roger and me? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=600.0s)]
*  Eighty nine. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=603.0s)]
*  Ninety two. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=605.0s)]
*  Ninety three. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=607.0s)]
*  Pull it up, Jamie. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=608.0s)]
*  Eighty nine. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=610.0s)]
*  It's eighty nine. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=611.0s)]
*  As you're talking about, I looked up something I tried typed in what I public education developed for factory workers. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=612.0s)]
*  People have been asking this question for a few years and hidden behind a Washington Post thing. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=620.0s)]
*  It says, no, they're not modeled after factories. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=625.0s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=627.0s)]
*  It started. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=628.0s)]
*  Apparently it came from this as it came from a 2009 book called Weapons of Mass Instruction. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=629.0s)]
*  And then it was echoed by someone in New York Times. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=635.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=637.0s)]
*  So it's a false narrative or is it what? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=639.0s)]
*  So how was it designed? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=642.0s)]
*  Was it designed? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=643.0s)]
*  It seemed like it was designed for structure and to get people to pay attention to rules. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=644.0s)]
*  This article says that that article is saying that they modeled the system after Prussia's United States adopted Prussia school system. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=648.0s)]
*  But that then goes and says that Prussia was not a highly industrialized country or interesting during that time period. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=656.0s)]
*  So the the accuracy of it seems a little off is kind of what I'm getting at. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=663.0s)]
*  Interesting. So I wonder. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=668.0s)]
*  So it hits it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=670.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=671.0s)]
*  It says here is in 2012, the American education model was actually copied from the 18th century Prussian model designed to create docile subjects and factory workers. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=673.0s)]
*  For what it's worth, Prussia was not highly industrialized when Frederick the Great formalized his education system in the late 1700s. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=682.0s)]
*  Very few places in the world were back then training future factory workers. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=690.0s)]
*  Docile or not was not really the point. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=694.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, industrialization is often touted as both the model and the rationale for public education system, past and present. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=697.0s)]
*  And by extension, it's part of a narrative that now contends that schools are no longer equipped to address the needs of a post-industrial world. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=704.0s)]
*  I looked it up because I've seen some other people and I've done started doing it too. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=712.0s)]
*  When I see something crazy on TikTok, that seems like a wild fact. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=716.0s)]
*  I'm like, holy shit. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=719.0s)]
*  You got to look at that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=720.0s)]
*  I got like, that's the TikTok filter. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=721.0s)]
*  Yeah, the TikTok. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=723.0s)]
*  There's no one who's checking on TikTok. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=724.0s)]
*  TikTok's fun, but man, half the shit. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=728.0s)]
*  You ever watch that guy where it's this guy with a beard and he's a little bit bigger. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=732.0s)]
*  This guy, check this video out. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=736.0s)]
*  We need to find this person. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=737.0s)]
*  He's pretty. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=739.0s)]
*  I haven't seen him. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=740.0s)]
*  But he shows like Karens or racist people like the clip. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=741.0s)]
*  And they hunt them down faster than any police. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=744.0s)]
*  Like there was a guy in LA, the Tesla guy who was running out hitting people with their cars with baseball bats. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=747.0s)]
*  And they called him the Tesla terrorist. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=754.0s)]
*  And they captured that guy faster than the police just from TikTok. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=757.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=760.0s)]
*  What was this guy's motivation for attacking people with Tesla? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=762.0s)]
*  He's attacked like I think it was like 10 people over the last three years. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=765.0s)]
*  Like women, everyone. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=768.0s)]
*  There's videos of him running out of the Tesla going out, like out of control. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=770.0s)]
*  So he's in a Tesla. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=773.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=774.0s)]
*  And so he's in a Tesla and then he's attacking. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=775.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=777.0s)]
*  It's not like he's attacking people only in Teslas. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=778.0s)]
*  I got screwed up. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=780.0s)]
*  He was in it. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=781.0s)]
*  He's in it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=782.0s)]
*  They call him the Tesla terrorist. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=783.0s)]
*  So he just pulls over and starts beating on people. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=784.0s)]
*  Random people. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=785.0s)]
*  Random people. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=786.0s)]
*  He's all amped up. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=787.0s)]
*  Like you could tell the guys just juiced. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=788.0s)]
*  He's on Adderall, bro. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=790.0s)]
*  Well, it said he was selling steroids. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=792.0s)]
*  No, selling steroids. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=794.0s)]
*  So he's getting roided up and beating people with bats randomly. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=795.0s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=799.0s)]
*  Tested, targeted at least six motorists is now selling steroids, was selling steroids. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=802.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=807.0s)]
*  I can't read. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=808.0s)]
*  Charges were filed Tuesday against a man caught on video attacking drivers in Los Angeles [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=809.0s)]
*  with a metal pole. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=813.0s)]
*  Prosecutors also revealed that Nathaniel Rademach had a previous road rage arrest in which steroids [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=814.0s)]
*  were allegedly found in his car. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=822.0s)]
*  Rademach, 36, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to four counts of assault by means of force to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=824.0s)]
*  produce great bodily injury. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=829.0s)]
*  Four counts of criminal threats and one felony count of vandalism. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=830.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=834.0s)]
*  This video right here, he just comes out. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=835.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=837.0s)]
*  If you haven't seen the video, you should watch. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=838.0s)]
*  I don't even want to see it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=840.0s)]
*  Just fucking crazy people. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=841.0s)]
*  God damn. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=844.0s)]
*  You ever see cart narcs? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=845.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=847.0s)]
*  Where the people don't put their cart back at the grocery store? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=848.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=851.0s)]
*  I found one the other day. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=852.0s)]
*  They literally did it to Perry from Windy City Heat. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=853.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=856.0s)]
*  No, but it makes sense. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=858.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable that Perry literally didn't put his cart away. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=860.0s)]
*  And that he's driving with a mask on too. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=865.0s)]
*  And he gets so mad. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=867.0s)]
*  So it literally brings Perry, and the guy doesn't even know it's Perry. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=868.0s)]
*  So Perry's being Perry. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=872.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=874.0s)]
*  Would you like a magnet instead? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=875.0s)]
*  Now sir. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=879.0s)]
*  Get your fucking shit off my fucking car. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=880.0s)]
*  It goes off. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=883.0s)]
*  I'm like this for a long time. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=884.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=886.0s)]
*  He's wearing a Perry Caravello live shirt. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=887.0s)]
*  But very few people know what that is. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=890.0s)]
*  Look sir. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=893.0s)]
*  But the ones that do, it's unbelievable. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=895.0s)]
*  It's hilarious that he narced on himself wearing his own shirt. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=898.0s)]
*  Essentially he narced on himself. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=901.0s)]
*  He's wearing a mask. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=903.0s)]
*  He gets away free. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=904.0s)]
*  Without that he gets away free. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=905.0s)]
*  He loses his mind. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=907.0s)]
*  In the end he leaves a voicemail. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=909.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=912.0s)]
*  Because there's a number on the cart narc thing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=913.0s)]
*  What did you think? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=915.0s)]
*  I never watched Windy City Heat. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=916.0s)]
*  I was like it's too mean. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=918.0s)]
*  Too mean to do that to a guy. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=920.0s)]
*  No. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=922.0s)]
*  He wanted that. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=923.0s)]
*  That's what he wanted. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=924.0s)]
*  I know, but he's an insane person. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=925.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=926.0s)]
*  Do you think you could do that today? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=927.0s)]
*  Do you think the same people involved? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=928.0s)]
*  Do you think Jimmy Kimmel could be involved in something like that? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=930.0s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=932.0s)]
*  None of them would be involved. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=933.0s)]
*  Not Carson Daly. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=935.0s)]
*  Not any of them. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=936.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=937.0s)]
*  Because that's what kind of got them to the dance. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=938.0s)]
*  That kind of comedy. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=941.0s)]
*  I think they could do a show comedy for Kimmel. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=943.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=945.0s)]
*  It's funny that they could never do that. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=946.0s)]
*  Bobcat. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=949.0s)]
*  Bobcat directed it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=950.0s)]
*  Bobcat might still do it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=951.0s)]
*  Dane Cook's in there. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=952.0s)]
*  Bobcat might still do it. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=953.0s)]
*  Bobcat's crazy. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=955.0s)]
*  Bobcat is this ongoing feud with Seinfeld. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=957.0s)]
*  It's the strangest thing. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=960.0s)]
*  And I don't understand why. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=962.0s)]
*  I mean I don't know either. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=964.0s)]
*  I know Bobcat much better than I know Seinfeld. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=965.0s)]
*  I don't know Seinfeld at all. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=967.0s)]
*  What's the beef? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=969.0s)]
*  I don't think I've ever met him. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=970.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=971.0s)]
*  I don't think I've ever met him. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=972.0s)]
*  Maybe I did way, way, way back in the day. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=973.0s)]
*  I went to see him live when I was 19. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=975.0s)]
*  I don't know what their beef is. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=976.0s)]
*  They have some sort of a beef. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=978.0s)]
*  And so they talk shit to each other all the time. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=979.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=982.0s)]
*  I had to follow Seinfeld at the comedy store. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=983.0s)]
*  Toughest follow I ever had in my entire life. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=986.0s)]
*  Oh, sure, dude. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=988.0s)]
*  Because all he did was talk about how Mitzi, the owner. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=989.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=992.0s)]
*  Told him he wasn't funny the last time he was there. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=993.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=996.0s)]
*  You were there for that set. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=997.0s)]
*  Crushing. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=999.0s)]
*  He buried me with a shovel. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1000.0s)]
*  Nothing like it ever. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1002.0s)]
*  Because he's telling them the whole story. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1003.0s)]
*  So even if the people didn't know how big of a deal it was that Seinfeld was in the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1005.0s)]
*  OR of the comedy store, he told them. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1009.0s)]
*  This lady told me I wasn't funny. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1011.0s)]
*  Wonder how she's doing now. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1013.0s)]
*  All this stuff. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1015.0s)]
*  And she's like, everyone knows she's sick and old. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1016.0s)]
*  And I bought a house above her house so that she could see me driving a different car all the time. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1019.0s)]
*  I beep as I went by. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1025.0s)]
*  Still not funny. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1026.0s)]
*  I mean, he's destroying. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1027.0s)]
*  Destroying. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1029.0s)]
*  It was like evil, cool fucking Seinfeld. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1030.0s)]
*  Oh, that's hilarious. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1032.0s)]
*  Evil, cool Seinfeld. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1034.0s)]
*  I was buried with a shovel. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1035.0s)]
*  Everybody, 70% of the people left the room. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1038.0s)]
*  The other 30% were literally texting their family. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1041.0s)]
*  I just saw Seinfeld make his return to the comedy store that he hasn't been here in 35 years. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1044.0s)]
*  He just told the whole story. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1049.0s)]
*  I'm performing. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1050.0s)]
*  I remember a fruit fly. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1051.0s)]
*  The only laugh I got the set was from a door guy or whatever because a fruit fly went in front of me real slow. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1053.0s)]
*  And the lights and it was all lit up. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1058.0s)]
*  I go, even the fruit flies getting out of here. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1060.0s)]
*  But that is the craziness of Mitzi. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1062.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1064.0s)]
*  How could she say no to Jerry Seinfeld? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1065.0s)]
*  Like even when he went there, he was already like a solid comic. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1067.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1072.0s)]
*  And that's the thing that they say is that when you used to tell Mitzi like, oh, this guy's a big deal from New York, that she'd be like, well, I'll see for myself. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1073.0s)]
*  Dude, the guy who used to book the store told me it's kind of better if you start off at the store. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1081.0s)]
*  Like Mitzi knows you're already a headliner, so she's going to make you a paid nonpaid regular. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1085.0s)]
*  So I became a nonpaid regular. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1090.0s)]
*  I couldn't just become a paid regular. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1092.0s)]
*  I had to do time as a nonpaid, which you go on like super late at night. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1093.0s)]
*  She didn't give a fuck about your credits. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1097.0s)]
*  Your credits almost hurt you. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1099.0s)]
*  Like if you came with credits, you're like, oh, he already thinks he knows everything. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1101.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1105.0s)]
*  And that's the vibe. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1106.0s)]
*  And it makes you wonder, like, is part of her brilliant was part of her brilliant madness, knowing that the way to bring out the most in Seinfeld was to do it. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1107.0s)]
*  Was to do that, perhaps to tell him he wasn't. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1114.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1117.0s)]
*  She was very outspoken about it to my face. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1119.0s)]
*  Seinfeld said it's funny because she said to me, she said, you know, you're the kind of person that needs someone to step on you and I'm going to be that person. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1122.0s)]
*  I have to admit she was right. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1132.0s)]
*  I needed that person. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1134.0s)]
*  She was that person and it really fueled me. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1135.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1137.0s)]
*  You were right. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1138.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1139.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is crazy. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1140.0s)]
*  I thought you were just joking around. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1142.0s)]
*  She's did you know that? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1144.0s)]
*  No, I've never seen that. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1146.0s)]
*  That's so wild that you guessed that. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1147.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1149.0s)]
*  That she would actually say that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1150.0s)]
*  Well, she was. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1151.0s)]
*  And then she said it to him back then. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1152.0s)]
*  So he must have already been killing it back then. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1154.0s)]
*  Like, what year was this? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1156.0s)]
*  1980. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1158.0s)]
*  1980. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1159.0s)]
*  So I think I saw him in. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1160.0s)]
*  It must have been like 86 or 87. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1166.0s)]
*  I saw him in Boston at the Paradise Theatre, which was like the big theater that was connected to Stitch's Comedy Club. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1170.0s)]
*  So Stitch's was like, well, tiny, tight little box was a great, great room. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1178.0s)]
*  And next door was like the bigger show where like that big headliners would come. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1183.0s)]
*  And I took my girlfriend to see Seinfeld. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1186.0s)]
*  I wasn't even old enough to drink yet. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1189.0s)]
*  And I was like, this is wild. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1191.0s)]
*  That's Jerry Seinfeld. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1192.0s)]
*  And that's where I got the idea of like asking questions to the audience, like letting the audience just hear. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1194.0s)]
*  Like letting the audience just yell out questions because he did that. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1199.0s)]
*  And I saw him do that. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1202.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, this is probably how he writes. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1203.0s)]
*  Because at that time, I was already thinking about doing stand up. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1205.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1208.0s)]
*  But I was like, oh, he's thinking this is how he writes. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1209.0s)]
*  Like he comes up with ideas by people like throw a thing at him and off the cuff because he's already murdering for an hour. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1212.0s)]
*  It was really impressive. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1218.0s)]
*  Super clean. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1219.0s)]
*  But like perfect jokes. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1220.0s)]
*  They were perfect jokes. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1222.0s)]
*  Just everything is like the setup, the punch line, the fucking way he handled himself on stage was like, wow, those guys are so intimidating when you're starting out. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1224.0s)]
*  Like you really need to go to an open mic night and watch people eat shit. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1233.0s)]
*  You need you fucking need that. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1237.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1239.0s)]
*  You need that when you're starting out. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1240.0s)]
*  I think you need that with everything. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1242.0s)]
*  Like if you think you're going to play basketball and you go to the NBA for the first time, you're like, what the fuck? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1244.0s)]
*  I can't move like that. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1248.0s)]
*  Like, I think that's the thing with everything. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1250.0s)]
*  People sucking helps in the beginning. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1252.0s)]
*  People sucking helps. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1254.0s)]
*  I remember that first night ever in a comedy club that I ever signed up for an open mic was at the comedy store and I got like number 12 on the lineup. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1255.0s)]
*  And I'm like, man, this, you know, here we go. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1263.0s)]
*  And they weren't as good as I thought they were going to be. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1266.0s)]
*  And I'm like, whoa, I think I have a chance. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1268.0s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1271.0s)]
*  Richard Jennings said that very thing. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1272.0s)]
*  Richard Jennings said that bad comedians inspire comedians to try. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1274.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1278.0s)]
*  I don't remember exactly how he phrased it, but it was something to that extent. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1279.0s)]
*  And he was he was so right. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1282.0s)]
*  I remember thinking that at the time, like if it wasn't for watching open micers, I would probably chicken it out. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1284.0s)]
*  But what you watch the open micers and you're like, oh, they're just clumsy like me. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1289.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1293.0s)]
*  Like, OK, OK, this is a thing you get good at. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1294.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1296.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1297.0s)]
*  And then it became like I thought you just were funny or you weren't funny. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1298.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, I'm kind of funny sometimes to my friends. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1301.0s)]
*  Like, how do I be funny to these people? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1305.0s)]
*  And then you go to an open mic night and you realize, oh, this is like a thing that everyone's working on to get better. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1307.0s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is this thing? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1312.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like this weird mass hypnosis, this weird idea game you're playing with people. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1314.0s)]
*  You know, the fact that you could do it for free always boggled my mind. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1320.0s)]
*  Like I was always all through high school and like, how am I going to pay for college? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1323.0s)]
*  Because I'm not getting a scholarship with my GPA. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1327.0s)]
*  So once I was out, I was literally paying for college and owed these loans. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1330.0s)]
*  Luckily, I dropped out fast, so I didn't get too deep in the hole. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1334.0s)]
*  But anyway, by the time I realized, like, wait, you could just do these open mics. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1337.0s)]
*  It's like free college. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1342.0s)]
*  This is except it's for a specific career. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1344.0s)]
*  And you get to watch like you'll get to watch Dave Chappelle pop in. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1347.0s)]
*  Yeah. You'll get to watch, you know, Damon Wayans will show up. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1351.0s)]
*  You get to watch, you know, all these fucking comics from other states that are in town. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1355.0s)]
*  They want to do a spot at the store. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1361.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the first place I saw Schultz. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1363.0s)]
*  That's the first place I saw Tim Dillon. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1365.0s)]
*  I mean, all those guys who came from New York, they all want to do the store. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1368.0s)]
*  So you if you're working there, man, and you're doing open mics and then you get a fucking doorman job. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1371.0s)]
*  Holy shit. You were that you had a free education. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1377.0s)]
*  You were there every day watching these killers work on their sets that they were going to do on Netflix. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1381.0s)]
*  And you're seeing it all evolve because you're seeing them Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1387.0s)]
*  You're seeing like all these multiple sets. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1392.0s)]
*  And so you get this just education of how it's pieced together that is unavailable to anybody who doesn't hang around the clubs. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1395.0s)]
*  Right. 100 percent. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1401.0s)]
*  It's the only way you can get it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1403.0s)]
*  Like you cannot there's not like a school you can go to make you a better stand up comic. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1404.0s)]
*  Like there's you know, you can learn things in regular school and you can apply them to stand up comedy. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1408.0s)]
*  But the only way to do stand up comedy and learn how to do is you have to do it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1414.0s)]
*  The fact that we have to do it in front of a crowd like you can't even practice it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1417.0s)]
*  There's nothing you could do by yourself. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1421.0s)]
*  You know, and even on the road, those other clubs don't run like the store. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1423.0s)]
*  There's not 16 headliners in each room. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1427.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1430.0s)]
*  So if you're lucky, you might be able to maybe work at a place where there's one headliner coming in, walking probably straight into the green room, doing the shows and then probably leaving right afterwards. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1431.0s)]
*  Well, think about the show we did at the Vulcan. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1442.0s)]
*  Think about the show. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1444.0s)]
*  You got Hans Kim and then you got David Lucas and then you got Mark Norman and then you got Ari Shafir. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1445.0s)]
*  Then you got Shane Gillis. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1452.0s)]
*  Then you got you. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1453.0s)]
*  Then you got me. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1454.0s)]
*  These are these are crazy shows, man. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1455.0s)]
*  Crazy shows. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1458.0s)]
*  They were so fucking fun. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1460.0s)]
*  It's been ridiculous. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1462.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1463.0s)]
*  It's a murder fest, too, from from start to go. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1464.0s)]
*  You know what makes me the happiest is watching the big pop that Ari gets. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1471.0s)]
*  When Ari goes on stage, he gets a giant pop. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1472.0s)]
*  People go nuts. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1474.0s)]
*  That special fucking pulled him out of the fire. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1475.0s)]
*  It was a beautiful special. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1479.0s)]
*  It's a perfect special. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1480.0s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1482.0s)]
*  The fact that he did it in front of candles and shit and had to relight all the candles. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1483.0s)]
*  And for him to do that with full blown AIDS is just incredible. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1487.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1490.0s)]
*  Full blown. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1491.0s)]
*  Imagine if that was like a real diagnosis. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1492.0s)]
*  You know, like full blown is such a street term. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1495.0s)]
*  There's someone really being fucked up by AIDS. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1498.0s)]
*  But if like, well, Tony, you've got full blown AIDS, your doctor said that to you. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1500.0s)]
*  What a disrespectful doctor to use the term full blown AIDS. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1505.0s)]
*  Bro, you got full blown AIDS. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1509.0s)]
*  That's like what kind of doctor did I get? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1512.0s)]
*  If you threw a bro at the front like that, that's even worse. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1514.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same doctor Redband was going to. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1517.0s)]
*  Diagnosis comes. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1520.0s)]
*  My metabolism so fast. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1521.0s)]
*  Bro, full blown AIDS. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1523.0s)]
*  Here's the good news. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1526.0s)]
*  People don't really die of it anymore. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1527.0s)]
*  And they got all crazy treatments now. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1529.0s)]
*  You could actually, they could actually reverse HIV. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1531.0s)]
*  You don't like people have like been cured of it now. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1534.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1536.0s)]
*  There's like multiple people. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1537.0s)]
*  It's really wild. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1538.0s)]
*  There's like this medicine that's been really helping. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1539.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what it is. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1541.0s)]
*  But I've been, the thing about like they had already come up with protease inhibitors and all these things that prevented people from getting really sick. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1542.0s)]
*  Like remember, Jeff Scott had it forever. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1551.0s)]
*  A fifth person is likely cured of HIV and another is in long term remission. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1553.0s)]
*  One case involved a man with cancer underwent a specialized stem cell transplant. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1559.0s)]
*  The other involved a woman who received immune boosting therapies as part of a clinical trial. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1565.0s)]
*  So this is different results from different studies. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1570.0s)]
*  So doing a couple of different methods. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1574.0s)]
*  And also likely cured is a little bit of a term, right? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1576.0s)]
*  Like imagine being that guy's boyfriend and he's like, good news, babe. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1579.0s)]
*  I'm likely cured. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1582.0s)]
*  Let's go no condom tonight. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1583.0s)]
*  They have another drug that you take now and it prevents you from getting HIV. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1585.0s)]
*  It's like a blocker. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1589.0s)]
*  So it's like a go crazy drug. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1590.0s)]
*  It's like for gay guys, you just gave them the fucking two, two, give them that green light. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1592.0s)]
*  If you give them a fucking pill that they could take and you definitely won't get AIDS. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1596.0s)]
*  Oh my God, they're going to try so hard to get AIDS. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1601.0s)]
*  They're going to go hard. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1603.0s)]
*  I think about how those must be getting thrown around like parade candy on Santa Monica Boulevard. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1607.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what a miracle. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1612.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1614.0s)]
*  Why science? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1615.0s)]
*  That's the good side of pharmaceutical drugs, right? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1616.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to talk about the bad side. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1618.0s)]
*  But you know, yeah, you can butt fuck and not get AIDS. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1621.0s)]
*  Boner pills. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1625.0s)]
*  It's a lot of different things came out. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1626.0s)]
*  But remember the fucking gas station pills, Fred Pitt? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1627.0s)]
*  I was burnt out. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1630.0s)]
*  I think it did damage. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1631.0s)]
*  Red Pan was taking these fucking who knows what bathtub they were mixed up in. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1633.0s)]
*  He would take these boner pills that he would buy at the gas station. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1640.0s)]
*  And apparently they're insane. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1644.0s)]
*  And I think they had steroids in them because like one time you got a little bit of road rage. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1646.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1650.0s)]
*  And sometimes I felt like I was like about to pass out. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1651.0s)]
*  Like I was tripping, like seeing trails and stuff. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1655.0s)]
*  Like what's that? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1657.0s)]
*  I think it was like blood pressure. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1658.0s)]

*  They just mixed them up and called it Rhino. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1663.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1665.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1666.0s)]
*  Remember the names? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1667.0s)]
*  Black Rhino. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1668.0s)]
*  It had a hologram of a rhinoceros. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1669.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1670.0s)]
*  And I had like I collected the containers that they came in because they were like trading cards. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1671.0s)]
*  And I had like 30 of them. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1675.0s)]
*  But when I moved to Texas, I was like, I have to throw this away. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1677.0s)]
*  What am I doing with like? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1680.0s)]
*  You should have saved them. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1681.0s)]
*  I just took photos of them. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1682.0s)]
*  Oh, you should have saved them. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1683.0s)]
*  They were so stupid. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1684.0s)]
*  But it was like, what a genius idea because you're only selling a couple pills, but you're selling it for like what? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1686.0s)]
*  What a prescription you really should be. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1690.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1691.0s)]
*  But so you have this crazy markup. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1692.0s)]
*  And then on top of that, who the fuck? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1694.0s)]
*  There's no one telling you. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1696.0s)]
*  There's no FDA involved in these transactions. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1697.0s)]
*  You're basically selling like vitamin B. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1699.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1701.0s)]

*  And that's why. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1706.0s)]
*  And then they test them and find out there's there was all sorts of stuff in there. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1707.0s)]
*  Viagra and Cialis and steroids. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1710.0s)]

*  That's when they made a new LLC and that's what the Rhino one Rhino two Rhino three was. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1719.0s)]

*  You there were steroids in them, too. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1731.0s)]
*  And weren't there some of them had amphetamines. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1732.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1734.0s)]

*  But it ended up being a boner pill. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1738.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1740.0s)]
*  Back in the day, it was John Jones or somebody. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1741.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think John there was something along those lines. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1742.0s)]
*  That's the story. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1746.0s)]
*  I know that boner pills were involved. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1747.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1748.0s)]

*  I don't think he's just taken. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1750.0s)]
*  But the thing is, like, if you're getting them online, like who the fuck? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1751.0s)]
*  I know who fucking knows who's cooking these things up, bro. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1754.0s)]

*  They're fired from the White House. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1895.0s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1897.0s)]
*  Something with the nuclear department. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1898.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was the... [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1901.0s)]
*  Department of Energy. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1902.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1903.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1904.0s)]
*  Department of Energy. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1905.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1907.0s)]
*  Former Department of Energy official Sam Brinton had been contained in her luggage that she reported missing on March 9, 2018 at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1908.0s)]
*  And then you see this person. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1920.0s)]
*  So she's a Houston-based Tanzanian fashion designer. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1921.0s)]
*  How do you say her name? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1926.0s)]
*  Asya Kamsan. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1927.0s)]
*  Asya Kamsan. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1929.0s)]
*  So she saw her fucking clothing that's one of a kind clothing that she designed. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1931.0s)]
*  And she's seeing this person who stole it, who works for the fucking White House. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1938.0s)]
*  Two separate airports. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1943.0s)]
*  And notice he appeared to be wearing her clothes in several photos. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1944.0s)]
*  Kamsan said she had packed the same clothes in a bag that vanished back in 2018. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1949.0s)]
*  So this person's been doing this forever, just stealing girls' clothes from the airport and then trying them on when they get home. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1955.0s)]
*  There's a thing called autogynephilia. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1961.0s)]
*  And it's men who are turned on by dressing like women. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1964.0s)]
*  But they're heterosexual. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1968.0s)]
*  But they're turned on by dressing like women. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1970.0s)]
*  They like to dress and maybe even behave like a woman. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1973.0s)]
*  And they get aroused by it. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1977.0s)]
*  Jordan Peterson talked about it. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1978.0s)]
*  He said it's always been a part of the psychology literature. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1981.0s)]
*  It's a reoccurring thing that exists with men. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1984.0s)]
*  That there's been men forever who like to dress up like women and it gets them sexually aroused. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1989.0s)]
*  And now they're in the same category as people that identify with being a woman. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=1995.0s)]
*  Like if you're a legitimate trans person. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2001.0s)]
*  And I know a lot of them. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2003.0s)]
*  I know a lot of them now. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2005.0s)]
*  There's some that you go like if you ever meet Blair White. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2006.0s)]
*  You go, OK, that's 100 percent correct. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2010.0s)]
*  Like whatever you're doing is correct. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2013.0s)]
*  Like she seems like a woman. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2015.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2017.0s)]

*  Oh, isn't that crazy? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2020.0s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2021.0s)]
*  Well, it's different. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2023.0s)]
*  But she's get he gets it. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2025.0s)]
*  There's a kink. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2027.0s)]
*  No, because it's folded over on the right side. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2028.0s)]
*  See how it's folded over with a pattern in the is a different pattern. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2030.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2034.0s)]
*  In the middle. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2035.0s)]
*  Oh, you're right. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2036.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2037.0s)]
*  Huh. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2038.0s)]
*  Oh, it could just be. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2039.0s)]
*  Are you sure it's not folded over? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2042.0s)]
*  Because you see the right side of his thing. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2044.0s)]
*  You see how it's the black. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2046.0s)]
*  You see the inner lining. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2048.0s)]
*  A different part. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2049.0s)]
*  Well, they wear it better. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2050.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2051.0s)]
*  But you see, well, the same person has the narrowest fucking shoulders for what appears [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2052.0s)]
*  to be a biological male. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2057.0s)]
*  And if you, you know, he's like got it folded over so it'll fit on his shoulders. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2059.0s)]
*  Like, I think if he spread it out, it might like fall over one shoulder. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2063.0s)]
*  That doesn't seem like the same picture. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2067.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2070.0s)]
*  It's a it's very similar. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2071.0s)]
*  Can you imagine what could also just be she had multiple pieces and you show photos of [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2073.0s)]
*  one of her pieces is similar to the other one that he was wearing. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2078.0s)]
*  But makes sense. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2080.0s)]
*  I mean, if the person's been busted more than once stealing chicks clothes, but that's like [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2082.0s)]
*  a kink thing, man. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2086.0s)]
*  That's not a poor person that needs clothing. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2087.0s)]
*  That's not a person in desperation trying to feed their family. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2089.0s)]
*  That's a kink. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2092.0s)]
*  That person's kinky. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2093.0s)]
*  They like to steal women's clothes and then put them on. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2095.0s)]
*  Maybe they're also good at energy. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2097.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2099.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2100.0s)]
*  But you can't hire them just because they like to dress like a woman. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2101.0s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2105.0s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2107.0s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2108.0s)]
*  Like, that's crazy. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2109.0s)]
*  And this is what you get when you go fishing for crazy. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2110.0s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2113.0s)]
*  You can't just hire someone because they like to dress like a woman. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2114.0s)]
*  Like, they have to actually not be crazy and not be stealing luggage and be good at their job. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2117.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2123.0s)]
*  Good face. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2125.0s)]
*  Good face on it. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2127.0s)]
*  Yeah, beautiful face. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2128.0s)]
*  Yeah, unbelievably stunning. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2129.0s)]
*  Can you imagine that being your type, like, looking for that? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2131.0s)]
*  Like, I've always wanted a woman with a shaved head and a goatee with a lot of lipstick. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2136.0s)]
*  I want someone who I can fucking watch football with. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2140.0s)]
*  Let's go! [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2142.0s)]
*  Fucking let's go! [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2143.0s)]
*  Go! [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2145.0s)]
*  It's just the whole thing is so odd. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2149.0s)]
*  Right, like, how does that person really beat out the other people for that job? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2154.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2161.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2162.0s)]
*  Did they really go through the people's resumes? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2163.0s)]
*  It's like the bit I'm doing about the teacher from Washington State or from Vancouver that has the giant fake tits. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2165.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2171.0s)]
*  Is it somewhere in Canada? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2172.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2173.0s)]
*  Did you see a picture of him in normal when he's not at work? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2175.0s)]
*  When he's not at work, he dresses like a regular guy. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2182.0s)]
*  He's running a clinger from MASH. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2185.0s)]
*  Clinger from MASH, remember? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2188.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2189.0s)]
*  Clinger dressed up like a woman. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2190.0s)]
*  That was his try to get out of Vietnam, and they said, fuck you, you're going to dress like a woman in Vietnam. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2191.0s)]
*  Oh, he's trying to get kicked out of the Army. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2196.0s)]
*  And the way he would try to get kicked out is try to dress like a woman. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2198.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2201.0s)]
*  And they just let him do it. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2202.0s)]
*  And then, you know, they made him dress like a man, but it never worked. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2203.0s)]
*  The point is, same with this person. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2206.0s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2209.0s)]
*  They're pulling a clinger. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2210.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2211.0s)]
*  My favorite episode of South Park of all time, Lemmy Winks, is when Mr. Garrison finds out that you can get a lot of money if you get fired for doing gay stuff. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2212.0s)]
*  So he keeps trying to outdo himself and be gayer and gayer, and the people keep talking about how brave he is. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2222.0s)]
*  And then finally brings in Mr. Slave, and he shoves a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass, and the whole episode turns into this adventure of the gerbil because the rectum closed. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2230.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2238.0s)]
*  The gerbil has to make his way all the way through the mouth. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2239.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. I saw that. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2241.0s)]
*  Dude, this came out when I was a senior in high school and just started smoking marijuana. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2244.0s)]
*  Like, I just started smoking weed, and two weeks later, this episode came out. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2248.0s)]
*  Oh, my God, I forgot how good this episode is. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2253.0s)]
*  Was dead. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2256.0s)]
*  The music is crazy. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2258.0s)]
*  There's fucking songs. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2260.0s)]
*  Did you see the live South Park concert? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2262.0s)]
*  They redid this live. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2264.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2266.0s)]
*  I forgot how funny that episode was. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2267.0s)]
*  They have so many bangers, dude. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2269.0s)]
*  So many bangers over the years. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2271.0s)]
*  There's not another show like it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2273.0s)]
*  And the fact that it's still going strong, still going strong. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2275.0s)]
*  You can't do it anywhere else. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2278.0s)]
*  Even Comedy Central, if you try to bring a show like that to Comedy Central, they'd be like, no fucking way. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2280.0s)]
*  But with South Park, just go ahead. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2287.0s)]
*  It is the 800-pound gorilla of cable TV. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2290.0s)]
*  It's like the one thing that no one can fuck with. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2295.0s)]
*  They go so hard. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2298.0s)]
*  They go so hard. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2300.0s)]
*  I saw a video of him using his kid to do the Canadian impressions, the Megan and... [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2301.0s)]
*  Ike. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2308.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2309.0s)]
*  He uses his own little kid, and he was like whispering in her ear, like, what to say. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2311.0s)]
*  So like he has her cussing and stuff, and he's like cracking up while holding it. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2316.0s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2320.0s)]
*  Don't kick the baby. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2321.0s)]
*  Good job. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2322.0s)]
*  Let's try one more like that. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2323.0s)]
*  I love you too, big brother. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2325.0s)]
*  I love you, big brother. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2327.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2329.0s)]

*  That's cute. That's adorable. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2332.0s)]
*  It's better when they're doing the cussing ones, though. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2337.0s)]
*  These ones are cute. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2339.0s)]

*  They really are. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2348.0s)]
*  What they do for just to advance comedy. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2349.0s)]
*  It's so awesome. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2352.0s)]
*  They let you be free to laugh at the most ridiculous shit. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2353.0s)]

*  It's like a fever pitch out there. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2369.0s)]
*  Whether it's Ukraine and Russia or COVID or fucking the climate. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2372.0s)]
*  It's like, whoa. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2377.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2410.0s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2411.0s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2412.0s)]
*  Did he just score a coup on Disney? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2413.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2416.0s)]
*  It's the land they own. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2417.0s)]
*  What? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2418.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2419.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2420.0s)]
*  It's a long â I remember reading in this a few months ago. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2421.0s)]
*  It first started happening. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2422.0s)]
*  It has to do with the water rights and stuff because it goes through that county. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2423.0s)]
*  They've portioned off that section where Disney World is. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2427.0s)]
*  They made it separate from Orange County. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2429.0s)]
*  Well, they gave them crazy, crazy, crazy tax breaks back in the day to draw tourism in. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2431.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2436.0s)]
*  So now he can charge them because they're supposedly woke and anti-DeSantis. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2437.0s)]
*  So he's like, screw it. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2444.0s)]
*  Now you guys can pay your fair share. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2446.0s)]
*  It's so weird how so many people that are involved in show business go that route. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2449.0s)]
*  So many people. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2457.0s)]
*  It's like they feel compelled. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2459.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2461.0s)]
*  Like people that wouldn't have done it five or six years ago wouldn't have gone along with it or are going along with it now. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2463.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2468.0s)]
*  They have to play the game. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2469.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2470.0s)]
*  It's weird to watch because I don't think it's representative of most people's sensibilities. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2471.0s)]
*  I think it's a very small â it's a very small group of very pushy people. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2477.0s)]
*  There's enough of them because there's a lot of people. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2482.0s)]
*  There's a lot of us. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2484.0s)]
*  There's a lot of us. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2485.0s)]
*  300 and fucking whatever million. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2486.0s)]
*  You're going to get enough that are like really into it and really noisy. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2488.0s)]
*  But the way the regular people think, the people of the world that don't have to pretend that they agree with something or disagree with something, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2492.0s)]
*  most people are very confused by what's going on. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2500.0s)]
*  Most regular people are very frustrated and confused by like someone like that who's working for the White House. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2502.0s)]
*  Like how? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2508.0s)]
*  How did that person get in there? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2509.0s)]
*  Did that person get in there just because they dress like that? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2511.0s)]
*  Because I think they did. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2513.0s)]
*  I think they did. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2514.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2515.0s)]
*  I think you can â I think that's how goofy they are. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2516.0s)]
*  Did you see the White House press secretary lady the other day? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2518.0s)]
*  She was touting all the different minorities and all the different people of â all the different women. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2520.0s)]
*  How many women work for the White House now? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2529.0s)]
*  A record number of people in the LGBTQ community work in the White House. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2531.0s)]
*  Like all these things that â okay, how are they doing? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2535.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2539.0s)]
*  How is this working? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2540.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2541.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it's working that well. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2542.0s)]
*  Like what â we don't care. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2543.0s)]
*  Like that's not what most people care about. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2545.0s)]
*  And if you're lesbian and you're great at your job, awesome. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2548.0s)]
*  If you're gay and you're great at your job, awesome. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2551.0s)]
*  But that shouldn't be all we're hearing about. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2553.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2556.0s)]
*  It shouldn't be all we're hearing about. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2557.0s)]
*  It's your identity, the identity politics thing. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2558.0s)]
*  Like as if somehow or another doing that is great for everybody. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2561.0s)]
*  Do you think about that when you look for anything good? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2565.0s)]
*  Do you think about like, well, I hope the staffing there is very diverse. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2568.0s)]
*  And you'd hope whoever the fuck is there is the best at whatever the fuck they do. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2573.0s)]
*  That's what you're thinking about. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2577.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2579.0s)]
*  Is that what they would want their doctor to walk in looking like? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2580.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2583.0s)]
*  I saw like there was like an internet meme about that. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2584.0s)]
*  About like what do you say when your house is on fire? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2589.0s)]
*  You're hoping the firefighting team is diverse that are coming to save you. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2594.0s)]
*  There's like there's been a few of these, but they're like, yeah, like that's not what you want. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2598.0s)]
*  You want diversity because you want people to all have an opportunity to do things. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2603.0s)]
*  You want it, but you don't want to force it. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2608.0s)]
*  Like you can't put people in a position that shouldn't be in the position just because of the color of their skin or where they were born. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2611.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2619.0s)]
*  And if if there's like a real problem with people of one group or another group not getting the opportunities, then we should address that because that's the real problem. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2621.0s)]
*  Everybody's at each other's throats for the wrong things. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2632.0s)]
*  When the real things are you have these massive communities of disenfranchised people like Youngstown, like where you grew up, like Detroit, like Baltimore. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2635.0s)]
*  There's places like that all over the country. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2648.0s)]
*  And we just sent how many billions of dollars to Ukraine? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2650.0s)]
*  Did we always have that money laying around? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2654.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2657.0s)]
*  OK, whether or not you agree that we should support Ukraine or not, I don't understand it. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2658.0s)]
*  It scares the shit out of me. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2662.0s)]
*  But if you had all that money laying around, you know how many things you could have fixed? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2664.0s)]
*  Like the real problem is people not getting the same like situation to grow up in, not getting a situation that's not filled with violence and drugs and gangs and chaos and shit. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2669.0s)]
*  But then no one's trying to fix that. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2682.0s)]
*  Like that's the if you want to fix the way people think about each other. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2684.0s)]
*  If everybody had like a decent chance, pretty much everybody had a decent chance like the whole country, you'd have way less problems. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2689.0s)]
*  You've got places where people are fucked from the jump and no one's doing anything to stop that. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2697.0s)]
*  No one's doing anything to try to help. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2702.0s)]
*  That's the real problem in this country. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2704.0s)]
*  It's it's not like most people don't give a fuck who you are. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2706.0s)]
*  They don't they just like you to be good at what you do and they like you to be fun to be around. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2711.0s)]
*  We all find each other's groove like, oh, this is Mike. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2715.0s)]
*  He's he's fucking weirdo, but he's cool about this. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2718.0s)]
*  And we you know, we all find our groove with each other. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2721.0s)]
*  You know how many comics we know that are gang. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2725.0s)]
*  Nobody gives a shit. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2727.0s)]
*  How many comics do we know that are of every ethnicity, every race? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2729.0s)]
*  It's when you're hanging around with comics, it's just who's funny. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2735.0s)]
*  It's just who's good. Who's cool to hang with. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2738.0s)]
*  Nobody gives a fuck about that. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2740.0s)]
*  That should be the whole world. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2742.0s)]
*  That should be the whole world. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2744.0s)]
*  I don't know if you get there by forcing people to get hired because they're a certain race or a certain gender or certain anything. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2746.0s)]
*  You got to get to the point where all these people have the same sort of crack at it. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2754.0s)]
*  So then it just becomes a meritocracy, like a real meritocracy, because that's the argument against it. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2759.0s)]
*  It's like it's not a meritocracy if people experience racism or sexism or if people grow up, you know, disenfranchised and they grow up in bad, bad areas. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2765.0s)]
*  Like they deserve like a little bit of an extra help. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2775.0s)]
*  And maybe they should be hired first. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2777.0s)]
*  This is the way that that's the thought process behind it. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2779.0s)]
*  But, well, I think that encourages like someone who's not as good to succeed. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2782.0s)]
*  And I don't think that's good for anybody. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2788.0s)]
*  I think the best people should succeed. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2790.0s)]
*  We just have to figure out like how to make that fair. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2793.0s)]
*  But the best people should succeed in everything. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2796.0s)]
*  That's the way we get better at stuff. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2798.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2800.0s)]
*  The NFL, I'm sure you probably know about this, but they have a very, very interesting thing that they're doing where you literally get better. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2801.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2809.0s)]
*  Draft picks or something based on how many black coaches you have instead of so you can literally reconstruct your team. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2810.0s)]
*  You can build it stronger. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2819.0s)]
*  Is it draft picks or is it a bigger salary cap or something? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2821.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2825.0s)]
*  The salary cap is wild because if there wasn't a salary cap, the Saudis would just come in. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2827.0s)]
*  And then we go, we have an idea. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2832.0s)]
*  Everybody a billion dollars. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2835.0s)]
*  Just fucking just buy up. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2837.0s)]
*  Like I think those guys have more money than we could possibly comprehend. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2839.0s)]
*  They're doing it with golf. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2843.0s)]
*  That LIB. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2845.0s)]
*  It seems to be working. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2846.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2847.0s)]
*  Is it? No? Jamie? Shaky shaky. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2848.0s)]
*  Tell me Jamie. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2850.0s)]
*  What's the definition of working? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2851.0s)]
*  I guess would be. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2853.0s)]
*  Are they having successful events? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2854.0s)]
*  They're just starting. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2855.0s)]
*  That's the definition of a successful event. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2857.0s)]
*  Oh, well now we're cutting hairs. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2858.0s)]
*  I don't know golf. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2860.0s)]
*  So you tell me like what's a successful event? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2861.0s)]
*  They just had their first event of the year. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2863.0s)]
*  And I was the response online is people aren't that into watching it. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2866.0s)]
*  It was on the CW, I think in the United States. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2869.0s)]
*  So it's a little tough to find that in the first place. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2871.0s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2873.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2874.0s)]
*  It's aired a way different way than they aired PGA golf. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2875.0s)]
*  It's aired to everybody. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2879.0s)]
*  You see all the shots at the same time. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2880.0s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2882.0s)]
*  Everyone's playing at once, which is way different. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2883.0s)]
*  Especially if you watch the full swing show that just started on Netflix. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2887.0s)]
*  They're explaining golf to people who don't really know it that well. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2890.0s)]
*  There is a lot of money in there though. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2893.0s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2896.0s)]
*  So that's successful for those people. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2898.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2900.0s)]
*  So professional pool is encountering a little bit of a renaissance. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2902.0s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2905.0s)]
*  There's a couple, a few companies that are putting on these events like Predators, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2906.0s)]
*  putting on these events and Matchroom Pool. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2910.0s)]
*  And they have this big, they're streaming them live online. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2912.0s)]
*  And it's becoming successful again. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2915.0s)]
*  Like pool because they're streaming them online. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2917.0s)]
*  They're doing it again. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2919.0s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2920.0s)]
*  And it's just they're doing the World Championships this weekend from the Rio. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2922.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2926.0s)]
*  I'm going to try to stop in on Friday and check it out. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2929.0s)]
*  Did you see the guy in East Palestine that talks like Mickey Mouse now? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2933.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2937.0s)]
*  I was just swallowing a true brain. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2938.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2940.0s)]
*  It's a nootropic. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2941.0s)]
*  You want to try it? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2942.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2943.0s)]
*  Dude was on my podcast once, the doctor, and he came up with this stuff. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2944.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2947.0s)]
*  Is it orange? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2948.0s)]
*  I think it was the doctor. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2949.0s)]
*  Was he a doctor? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2950.0s)]
*  I don't want to give anybody extra titles. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2951.0s)]
*  You want to try one? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2953.0s)]
*  Want to get smarter? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2954.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2955.0s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2956.0s)]
*  Stay where you're at? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2957.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2958.0s)]
*  It doesn't make you smarter. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2959.0s)]
*  Helps your memory a little bit. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2960.0s)]
*  It's good for verbal memory. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2962.0s)]
*  Sometimes the Mary Jane fucks with the mind. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2964.0s)]
*  That's delicious. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2967.0s)]
*  It's good, right? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2968.0s)]
*  It's nice, a little liquid, a little shot. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2969.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2972.0s)]
*  It's like a snow cone. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2973.0s)]
*  The voice thing, wouldn't there be multiple videos of multiple people with that? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2975.0s)]
*  It could be his own reaction to it. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2979.0s)]
*  He got a very high dose. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2981.0s)]
*  It could be there's more people. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2982.0s)]
*  They're not talking about it. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2984.0s)]
*  It says there's more people. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2985.0s)]
*  More people? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2986.0s)]
*  That's what this article says. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2987.0s)]
*  They're going to go check door to door. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2989.0s)]
*  They're sending the CDC in. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2991.0s)]
*  Bro, this is very scary stuff. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2993.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2995.0s)]
*  Very scary stuff. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2996.0s)]
*  Youngstown's 20 minutes from there. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2997.0s)]
*  And they just call it East Palestine. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2998.0s)]
*  They don't say it's 45 minutes away from Pittsburgh or 45 minutes away from Cleveland. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=2999.0s)]
*  They just call it East Palestine. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3004.0s)]
*  So it's getting into Youngstown too. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3005.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3007.0s)]
*  It's getting in everywhere, right? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3008.0s)]
*  Everywhere. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3009.0s)]
*  Pittsburgh's really close. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3010.0s)]
*  Columbus is not far away. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3011.0s)]
*  Dude, that's so scary. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3012.0s)]
*  Did you see the dead deer that they've been finding? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3014.0s)]
*  This dude took video. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3016.0s)]
*  He was down by the river or this creek or whatever it is. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3018.0s)]
*  And it's just fucking completely polluted. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3021.0s)]
*  You know, you throw rocks in it. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3023.0s)]
*  You see big oil slicks and bull up. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3024.0s)]
*  And he found three dead deer, like really close to each other. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3026.0s)]
*  That's where it is on the map. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3030.0s)]
*  There's East Palestine. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3031.0s)]
*  Youngstown's up here. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3032.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3033.0s)]
*  Youngstown's right there, dude. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3034.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3035.0s)]
*  Pittsburgh's right there. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3036.0s)]
*  Are those videos of it raining in Ohio where it was like foam? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3037.0s)]
*  Is that fake? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3040.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3041.0s)]
*  Do you see that? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3042.0s)]
*  That's all the snow and all the stuff in the ground. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3043.0s)]
*  It's like foaming rain. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3044.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3046.0s)]
*  Bro, what's in those clouds now? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3047.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3049.0s)]
*  Imagine? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3050.0s)]
*  And that's a cloudy place. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3051.0s)]
*  They literally have the lake effect there. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3052.0s)]
*  So the precipitation, that's where it's always cloudy. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3054.0s)]
*  Grace gods. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3058.0s)]
*  Always. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3059.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3060.0s)]
*  So it's sitting above you. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3061.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3062.0s)]
*  Is it? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3063.0s)]
*  Does it dissipate? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3064.0s)]
*  What happens to the poison that gets into the air? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3065.0s)]
*  It goes to Pittsburgh. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3068.0s)]
*  Yeah, where does it go? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3069.0s)]
*  Like if it really hovers over you, like holy shit, and comes down when it rains, what the [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3070.0s)]
*  fuck? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3075.0s)]
*  The video that I don't know if it's real, it showed a man outside and when it was raining, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3076.0s)]
*  it just seemed like it was suds. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3080.0s)]
*  And so that's not normal. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3081.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's a real video, it's TikTok. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3082.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you think that whatever the smoke is, like whatever the particles are, they [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3084.0s)]
*  would be too heavy to just sit in the clouds? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3088.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you think that they would fall to the ground? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3090.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3094.0s)]
*  We're too stupid at talking about this. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3095.0s)]
*  Jamie, you're smart. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3097.0s)]
*  What do you think would happen? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3098.0s)]
*  Like if chemicals were burned and they went into the clouds, would they stay in the clouds? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3100.0s)]
*  I think back to the movies of like the dirty waters just came out where they're looking [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3105.0s)]
*  into like, you know, chemical companies and people getting fucked up and there's giant [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3109.0s)]
*  lawsuits that go on forever. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3113.0s)]
*  Aaron Brockovich thing I think was a similar situation. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3115.0s)]
*  People get fucked up from some chemical company. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3117.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3121.0s)]
*  Repeat. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3122.0s)]
*  Why would this one be different, honestly? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3123.0s)]
*  No, I think it is. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3124.0s)]
*  I think but what I'm asking is do you think that when they burn the chemicals, they stay [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3125.0s)]
*  in the clouds? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3129.0s)]
*  Does that make any sense? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3130.0s)]
*  I don't think they're going to tell us and explain it to us simple people. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3131.0s)]
*  You know, some people might know. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3135.0s)]
*  What a mad scramble. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3137.0s)]
*  Did you and do you see that people were trying to blame Trump because of deregulation? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3138.0s)]
*  But it turns out that whatever deregulation he passed wouldn't have applied to this and [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3142.0s)]
*  also wasn't instituted and never really went through. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3146.0s)]
*  They tried to blame him. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3151.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3152.0s)]
*  Make sure that's true. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3153.0s)]
*  How? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3154.0s)]
*  Check. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3156.0s)]
*  If anybody can, you can, Jamie. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3157.0s)]
*  What is the question? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3159.0s)]
*  Was deregulation by Trump? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3161.0s)]
*  Was Trump era deregulation responsible for the crash? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3163.0s)]
*  Because I think it was not. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3169.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3171.0s)]
*  Yeah, I heard that it was about the. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3172.0s)]
*  It was a bearing. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3174.0s)]
*  For the company, not even the train. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3175.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3177.0s)]
*  That's what I had understood. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3178.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3179.0s)]
*  The deregulation was about. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3180.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3181.0s)]
*  The train was going to happen anyway. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3182.0s)]
*  Remember, we looked up it was like $1,700 a year. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3184.0s)]
*  So the deregulation was just basically like giving money to the corporations or letting [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3186.0s)]
*  them pay less money. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3192.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3193.0s)]
*  So like first thing says Washington Post analysis so far Trump's rollback of regulations can't [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3195.0s)]
*  be blamed for the train wreck. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3200.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3202.0s)]
*  And that's Washington Post. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3203.0s)]
*  So that's Washington Post. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3204.0s)]
*  See, NTSB chair contradicts post that wrongly claimed Trump to blame for Ohio train wreck. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3205.0s)]
*  But that's like a thing that people do immediately. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3211.0s)]
*  Whenever there's something fucked up, they immediately point at Trump. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3214.0s)]
*  He did it. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3217.0s)]
*  He did it. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3218.0s)]
*  But when the problem like that is, like when you say he did it, a lot of people hear, oh, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3220.0s)]
*  he did it. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3224.0s)]
*  And then how many people hear the follow up? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3225.0s)]
*  How many people hear like, no, he didn't do it. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3228.0s)]
*  And this is actually what happened. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3230.0s)]
*  I bet it's probably like 60, 40. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3232.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3234.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3235.0s)]
*  I bet like 40 percent find out that it wasn't true. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3236.0s)]
*  This is from article says Buttigieg calls on Trump to back reversing deregulation and [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3238.0s)]
*  wake of a train derailment. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3243.0s)]
*  They're saying it comes from this letter. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3245.0s)]
*  Well, maybe he's correct. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3248.0s)]
*  Let's let's read what he has to say. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3250.0s)]
*  Both things could be true. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3252.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3253.0s)]
*  What could be true is that the deregulation is bad. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3254.0s)]
*  And what also could be true is that Trump wasn't responsible for this this particular [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3257.0s)]
*  crash. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3262.0s)]
*  Both things can be true. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3263.0s)]
*  Says one thing he can do to express it, express support for reversing the deregulation that [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3264.0s)]
*  happened on his watch. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3269.0s)]
*  I heard him say he had nothing to do with it, even though it was in his administration. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3271.0s)]
*  So if he had nothing to do with it and they did it in his administration against his will, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3275.0s)]
*  maybe he can come out and say that he supports us moving in a different direction. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3280.0s)]
*  That seems very reasonable, doesn't it? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3285.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3288.0s)]
*  White House has blamed Republican lawmakers in the Trump administration for lax railway [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3289.0s)]
*  and environmental regulations in the aftermath of the derailment. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3293.0s)]
*  White House has pointed to a 2021 letter from the Republican senators to the Federal Railroad [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3296.0s)]
*  Administration urging the agency to expand the use of automated track inspection and [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3302.0s)]
*  pointed to a Republican study committee proposal to cut to government funding for to address [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3307.0s)]
*  chemical spills. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3315.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3316.0s)]
*  That's a weird way the proposal to cut to government funding. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3317.0s)]
*  I think it's just a typo there. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3321.0s)]
*  Additionally, Politico reported the Trump administration rolled back several safety [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3323.0s)]
*  measures for railways, including regular safety audits and an Obama-era rule that required [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3327.0s)]
*  faster brakes on trains carrying flammable materials. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3332.0s)]
*  Dude, how about the fastest brakes? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3336.0s)]
*  It's containing flammable materials? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3340.0s)]
*  How about the fastest fucking brakes you can make? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3343.0s)]
*  But that's a true thing, though, that this particular rail that that thing happened on [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3347.0s)]
*  was not set up for transferring hazardous waste, right? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3353.0s)]
*  Or hazardous materials? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3357.0s)]
*  Isn't that true? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3359.0s)]
*  I think they're saying that that train was not set up for having that kind of stuff on it. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3362.0s)]
*  It's like, bro, it can just fall off the tracks going 300 miles an hour and explode. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3368.0s)]
*  Like, what do you got in there? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3374.0s)]
*  And you're going to ruin everything forever all around it? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3376.0s)]
*  Like, how long before they clean that up? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3379.0s)]
*  And now what are they going to do it? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3381.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm reading right now. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3383.0s)]
*  What are they going to do with this stuff? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3384.0s)]
*  What are they doing with it? They're putting it in a landfill. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3385.0s)]
*  In Indiana, right? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3386.0s)]
*  Putnam County landfill. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3387.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3388.0s)]
*  Terrific. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3389.0s)]
*  Put it in the earth. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3391.0s)]
*  Driving it across the state. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3392.0s)]
*  If you own a landfill, bro, you could put anything in there. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3393.0s)]
*  Computers, bodies, all kinds of shit. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3397.0s)]
*  Old cocaine, like dressers. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3400.0s)]
*  Four hours ago story. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3402.0s)]
*  Ohio toxic train disaster leads to more concerns in other states while scientists say chemical [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3404.0s)]
*  tests in East Palestine are unusually high. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3409.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you think? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3413.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3414.0s)]
*  Unusually high. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3415.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3416.0s)]
*  What a crazy statement. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3419.0s)]
*  Unusually high. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3421.0s)]
*  How about toxic for humans? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3424.0s)]
*  I mean, what happens to those people that can't move? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3426.0s)]
*  Those people that are stuck there? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3429.0s)]
*  Like, they can't afford to move. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3430.0s)]
*  They've got nowhere to go. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3431.0s)]
*  That's everybody there, by the way. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3433.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3434.0s)]
*  At least it's going to be really cheap to move them somewhere else. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3435.0s)]
*  Like $550,000 houses everywhere. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3437.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3440.0s)]
*  I mean, you got to get those people out of there. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3443.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3445.0s)]
*  Like, how dangerous is it, you think, to be there right now? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3446.0s)]
*  Is it just groundwater or is it air? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3449.0s)]
*  Is it everything? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3452.0s)]
*  Fuck, man. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3455.0s)]
*  You know how scary that would be if you were poor and you were stuck in that spot? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3456.0s)]
*  Was that plane crash real? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3459.0s)]
*  That happened? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3460.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3462.0s)]
*  You know that story? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3463.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3464.0s)]
*  Dude, a plane that was headed with, isn't it true? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3465.0s)]
*  It seemed. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3470.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3471.0s)]
*  I'm trying to double check. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3472.0s)]
*  I want to triple check, but I'm pretty sure there were environmental, yeah. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3473.0s)]
*  Five environmental scientists who died in a plane crash were headed to East Palestine, Ohio. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3475.0s)]
*  It says false. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3480.0s)]
*  Five employees of an environmental consulting firm died in a plane crash near Little Rock, Arkansas on Wednesday. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3481.0s)]
*  But they were not traveling to East Palestine where a freight train derailed. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3488.0s)]
*  The employees were responding to an unrelated February 20 explosion at a metals plant in a Cleveland suburb more than 60 miles away. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3492.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3502.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3503.0s)]
*  So it wasn't true. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3504.0s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3505.0s)]
*  So the facts and the days since the February 22 plane crash, some social media users have falsely claimed the aircraft was transporting environmental scientists to East Palestine where a freight train derailment earlier in the month prompted officials to intentionally release and burn toxic vinyl cladding. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3506.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3522.0s)]
*  So it wasn't true. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3523.0s)]
*  So there was a plane crash filled with scientists, but they were going to a different spill. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3524.0s)]
*  That seems a little fishy. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3528.0s)]
*  Why are five environmental scientists going to some other thing nobody's heard of when there's this massive tragedy 60 minutes away? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3530.0s)]
*  And that's probably the closest major. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3535.0s)]
*  Well, I guess Pittsburgh is a more major airport that's closer. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3537.0s)]
*  But that's the second closest. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3541.0s)]
*  Well, we would have to. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3543.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, we didn't know these scientists were going there. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3544.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3546.0s)]
*  So we would have to assume they've already sent scientists to East Palestine. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3547.0s)]
*  They don't have to tell you that they're doing that. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3550.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3551.0s)]
*  It's not like they make a press release. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3552.0s)]
*  Like we're sending scientists to find out because then people want to know, like, what's the results? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3553.0s)]
*  Like, if the results are unprintable, like, if the results are like, oh, my God, like, everyone's going to die. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3557.0s)]
*  Like, who knows what the results are? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3562.0s)]
*  And we know that if it is unprintable, they're not going to tell us anyway. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3564.0s)]
*  So from past to everything, if they sent five people to this other crash, how many of these five thousand years ago, how many of these send to East Palestine? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3567.0s)]
*  They want to like check for sure. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3577.0s)]
*  They want to like double and triple check on this one because this is a doozy. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3579.0s)]
*  People are calling it like an American Chernobyl. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3582.0s)]
*  It's like this is scary shit. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3584.0s)]

*  It's a fun office mate right there. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3622.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3624.0s)]
*  Seems like they're having a good time on the job. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3625.0s)]
*  Give me three black rhinos and an eight hour shift. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3627.0s)]
*  Too much. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3630.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3632.0s)]
*  Three will have a heart attack. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3633.0s)]
*  You got to be careful. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3635.0s)]
*  How many people died from rhino pills? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3637.0s)]
*  Probably a lot. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3639.0s)]
*  We should find that. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3640.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3641.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3642.0s)]
*  Because you know, if it would be have to be like someone heart attacks, some bankers son died from rhino pills and then they would ban them. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3643.0s)]
*  So it would have to be someone influential who died. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3652.0s)]
*  I'm going to guess. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3655.0s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3656.0s)]
*  I don't think there's a number for that because it pretty much is like whatever the boner pill really is like Viagra. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3658.0s)]
*  A lot of people probably overdose on Viagra like their blood pressure drops. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3663.0s)]
*  They have a heart attack or something like that. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3666.0s)]
*  But I think there's probably deaths that you can absolutely attribute to boner pills. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3668.0s)]
*  If you think of all the people out there, all the crazy fucks that try to drink a gallon of whiskey and fucking smoke 50 packs of cigarettes like just people that go hard. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3673.0s)]
*  If they go hard with the rhino pills, I want to know how many will kill you. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3682.0s)]
*  Imagine if the guys like fuck bro. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3685.0s)]
*  I'm going out with Heidi tonight. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3688.0s)]

*  It sounds like the next episode of Protect Your Parks. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3695.0s)]
*  You guys should each take three boner pills and just try to fucking maintain. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3698.0s)]
*  Look at each other right in the eyes. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3703.0s)]

*  damage to the reproductive tract in women and swollen testicles in men, both of which [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3888.64s)]
*  can lead to infertility. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3893.12s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3895.48s)]

*  Penicillin. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3901.04s)]

*  Bro, people were dying of syphilis and now they just give you a shot. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3908.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3912.88s)]

*  See what it looks like? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3916.76s)]
*  Like holes in their face. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3918.1200000000003s)]
*  Their noses fall off, holes in their scalp, like giant patches of tissue missing. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3919.96s)]

*  Dude. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3932.2400000000002s)]
*  It's crazy because that was a common thing back in the day. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3933.68s)]

*  Look at the paintings of people that had syphilis too. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3946.04s)]
*  Look at that one on the upper top. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3949.0s)]
*  Look at the upper top with the guy with the head, the bald head. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3951.16s)]
*  Look at his head. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3954.12s)]

*  Didn't he die from syphilis? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3984.34s)]
*  I think so. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3985.34s)]
*  Yep, there he is right there, bottom right. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3986.34s)]

*  Go to that. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3993.1400000000003s)]
*  Let me see what famous people died of syphilis. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3994.1400000000003s)]
*  So Bram Stoker, the guy who rode Jackula. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3996.98s)]
*  He dried. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=3999.94s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4000.94s)]
*  Which is kind of fucked because getting syphilis is kind of like being bit by a monster. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4002.06s)]
*  Like you're slowly rotting away. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4005.7000000000003s)]
*  Al Capone. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4009.1400000000003s)]
*  Late stages of neuro syphilis at 48 years old. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4013.1800000000003s)]
*  God damn. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4016.5s)]
*  Al Capone was 48 when he went down? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4017.5s)]
*  Damn. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4019.7400000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4020.7400000000002s)]
*  He was 48 with syphilis. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4022.14s)]
*  Imagine. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4023.14s)]
*  At dirt. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4024.14s)]
*  You know. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4027.14s)]
*  All the shit Al Capone got through. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4028.14s)]
*  An STD took him out. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4029.14s)]
*  One piece of pussy. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4031.66s)]
*  Dudes that they had those bullets in the circle, those Tommy guns. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4032.66s)]
*  Back in those days, I mean Al Capone was running the mob in Chicago. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4037.54s)]
*  Bullets were probably flying at him all the time. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4042.3399999999997s)]
*  Syphilis gets him. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4045.2599999999998s)]
*  Didn't they think he was like in a vault at one point in the 80s and they had like a lot? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4046.2599999999998s)]
*  Geraldo Rivera found his vault and they didn't bother to check to see if there was anything [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4051.74s)]
*  in it. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4058.2599999999998s)]
*  They wanted to reveal it live on TV. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4059.2599999999998s)]
*  And so Geraldo breaks through the wall and he goes inside with the camera and there's [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4061.3799999999997s)]
*  nothing. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4065.14s)]
*  Zero. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4066.14s)]
*  So everybody was like hanging on the edge of their seat because it's live. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4067.14s)]
*  It was a live event. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4071.02s)]
*  And Geraldo Rivera was breaking into Al Capone's vault in a live event. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4072.02s)]
*  And there's nothing in there. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4076.66s)]
*  Geraldo Rivera's had a lot of rough moments. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4078.54s)]
*  Well that was the roughest. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4081.14s)]
*  That was purely the roughest. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4082.14s)]
*  But the greatest moment he ever had was on the Geraldo Rivera show, whatever the fuck [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4083.68s)]
*  the show was called, when he introduced the world to the Kennedy assassination video. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4087.7s)]
*  Dick Gregory, who's a comic, Dick Gregory came onto the Geraldo Rivera show with the [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4093.3799999999997s)]
*  footage that he had obtained of the Kennedy assassination from the Zapruder film. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4100.38s)]
*  The Zapruder film was acquired, I believe, by Time Life. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4106.18s)]
*  I think they were acquired by Life Magazine. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4109.66s)]
*  And they didn't do anything with it for a long time. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4112.5s)]
*  And then he got it. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4114.78s)]
*  And I want to say they aired it on TV. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4116.0199999999995s)]
*  It was at least 10 years, if not 12 years after the murder. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4120.46s)]
*  So it was like 75, I think. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4124.66s)]
*  And so on the show, he introduces this. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4127.24s)]
*  There's Geraldo Rivera looking sexy as fuck. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4131.74s)]
*  1975, Sudeirko's. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4135.18s)]
*  So it's 12 years. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4137.14s)]
*  Oh, it's Goodnight America, what it was called. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4138.58s)]
*  That was Geraldo Rivera's show. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4142.18s)]
*  It's Geraldo, this beautiful main is the host, and Dick Gregory comes on, and Dick Gregory [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4144.26s)]
*  brings on this other cat. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4149.34s)]
*  I don't know who the other guy is. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4151.18s)]
*  Bad guy from James Bond. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4152.62s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4153.62s)]
*  It looks like that's the guy with the button. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4154.62s)]
*  Jaws. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4160.62s)]
*  Jaws, yeah. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4161.62s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4162.62s)]
*  OK, so when they watch it, you could see Geraldo Rivera react to it. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4164.099999999999s)]
*  Let's play it, because this was the thing. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4171.0599999999995s)]
*  The thing was a lot of people at that time, they're coming off of the Vietnam War. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4174.0199999999995s)]
*  There's a lot of people that have a massive distrust of the government. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4180.0599999999995s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that thought that Kennedy was assassinated by more than one [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4183.42s)]
*  person. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4187.7s)]
*  There was all these rumors of people shooting from the grass. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4188.7s)]
*  There was all these conspiracy theories. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4192.1s)]
*  But until you watch the actual video of the assassination, there was no confirmation that [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4194.7s)]
*  something was amiss. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4199.14s)]
*  And you watch the video and his head goes back and to the left when he gets shot, and [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4200.62s)]
*  you're like, what am I looking at here? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4204.1s)]
*  What's going on here? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4206.9800000000005s)]
*  He got shot in the neck as well. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4208.54s)]
*  That's another thing. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4210.66s)]
*  You could see he grabs his neck, and then you see his head go back. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4211.66s)]
*  And it's not consistent with this idea of a magic bullet that goes through two people [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4215.5s)]
*  and creates all the looks like he's getting hit multiple times. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4220.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4223.7s)]
*  And the brain goes back. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4224.7s)]
*  It goes into the trunk. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4226.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4227.9800000000005s)]
*  What is happening? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4228.9800000000005s)]
*  This is a film taken by Marie Muchmore that leads into the Zapruder film. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4229.9800000000005s)]
*  It's for time continuity. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4234.7s)]
*  The president is waving to the crowd here. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4237.34s)]
*  And Jacqueline Kennedy, of course, is sitting alongside him in the open car. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4239.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4243.62s)]
*  This is from more of an Onyxas film. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4244.62s)]
*  This is originally 8 millimeter footage. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4246.58s)]
*  And they're heading now toward Elm Street. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4251.82s)]
*  They're on Houston Street now. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4253.94s)]
*  They're going to make a left-hand turn. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4254.94s)]
*  It's on the corner where they're going to make the turn there that the book depository [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4257.86s)]
*  was. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4260.74s)]
*  Now, this is the Zapruder film. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4261.74s)]
*  OK. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4262.74s)]
*  So the cars are coming along now into Deeley Plaza? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4263.74s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4266.22s)]
*  These are the lead motorcycles of the motorcade. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4267.22s)]
*  All right. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4268.7s)]
*  Now, with the president and Mrs. Kennedy is also Governor Connolly. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4269.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4272.7s)]
*  Before he goes behind the sign, the president is waving to the crowd. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4273.7s)]
*  When he comes out from behind the sign, he is shot. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4276.139999999999s)]
*  Then Governor Connolly is shot. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4279.0199999999995s)]
*  He's already been hit. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4280.46s)]
*  He's already been hit. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4281.46s)]
*  And now? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4282.46s)]
*  At the bottom of the screen, the head shot. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4283.46s)]
*  That's the shot that blew off his head. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4287.38s)]
*  Oh. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4288.86s)]
*  It's the most horrifying thing I've ever seen in a movie. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4289.86s)]
*  Now, the Warren Commission said that all of the shots were fired from behind by Lee Harvey [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4291.86s)]
*  Oswald, a lone assassin, firing at the president. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4296.0599999999995s)]
*  And as you could see, clearly, the head is thrown violently backwards. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4299.9s)]
*  Completely consistent with the shot from the front. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4304.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4306.0599999999995s)]
*  Now, this is an extreme blow up of just the president from the film. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4307.0599999999995s)]
*  All right. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4311.14s)]
*  Coming out behind the sign, he's shot. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4312.14s)]
*  He's hit from the front, too. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4314.0599999999995s)]
*  From the front. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4316.18s)]
*  Now, Jackie doesn't realize what's happened yet. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4317.18s)]
*  She goes to his aid. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4319.86s)]
*  And now? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4321.66s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4322.66s)]
*  So fucked up. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4323.66s)]
*  He's hit from the front. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4324.66s)]
*  Again, the violent backward motion. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4326.66s)]
*  Totally consistent with 80% of the witnesses, which said the shot came from the grassy knoll [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4329.22s)]
*  in front into the right. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4334.14s)]
*  It's interesting to note how many people is running towards where most folks thought the [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4335.14s)]
*  shots came from. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4339.06s)]
*  The head goes backwards in the next film from the other side of the street. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4340.06s)]
*  Oh, God, that's awful. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4345.58s)]
*  That's the most upsetting thing I've ever seen. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4349.38s)]
*  We'll talk about it in a minute. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4351.38s)]
*  Wild. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4354.38s)]
*  Wild. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4355.38s)]
*  How strong is Dick Gregory? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4356.38s)]
*  Dick Gregory in 1975 bringing that film footage with who's the other guy he was with? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4357.9s)]
*  I should give that guy a shout out. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4364.099999999999s)]
*  I got to meet Dick. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4371.74s)]
*  You say Robert Groton? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4372.74s)]
*  At the end of this description, it says Robert Groton is one of Rivera's guests. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4373.74s)]
*  OK, it must be. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4378.54s)]
*  It must be. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4379.54s)]
*  Dick Gregory had a little comedy club in downtown LA. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4380.54s)]
*  Did you ever go there? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4383.5s)]
*  No. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4384.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4385.86s)]
*  When was that? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4386.86s)]
*  In 2000, like 14, 15, 13. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4388.82s)]
*  The one down the down downtown? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4391.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4393.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4394.82s)]
*  It was Dick Gregory's comedy club, I think it was called. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4395.82s)]
*  Is that the guy? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4398.179999999999s)]
*  I'm asking. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4399.179999999999s)]
*  Doesn't seem like it. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4400.179999999999s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4401.179999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4402.179999999999s)]
*  Are you sure? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4403.179999999999s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4404.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Robert. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4405.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it is. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4406.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's him. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4407.179999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4408.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he looks different. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4409.179999999999s)]
*  He's creeping me out in that picture. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4410.179999999999s)]
*  That's pretty creepy. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4411.179999999999s)]
*  Well, he's seen some shit. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4412.179999999999s)]
*  Imagine if you're the guy who gets ahold of the footage that shows that Kennedy got assassinated [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4415.5s)]
*  by a guy from the front and you're going to show it on television. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4418.780000000001s)]
*  What a wild scramble that must have been the next day. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4423.740000000001s)]
*  Did they explain how they got it? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4427.06s)]
*  It's a good question. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4431.18s)]
*  It was like 12 years later, wasn't it? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4432.18s)]
*  I believe we said it was 13 years. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4435.18s)]
*  It was 13 years after the assassination, or 12 years, right? [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4437.34s)]
*  75? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4440.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was 63. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4441.780000000001s)]
*  Buy someone's storage thing and start looking through it? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4443.38s)]
*  Yard sale. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4445.38s)]
*  I think, like I said, I think Time Magazine had acquired it. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4446.38s)]
*  Time Life or Life Magazine, whatever it was back then, I think they had acquired it and [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4450.58s)]
*  they had the footage and they didn't release it. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4455.38s)]
*  Somehow or another, Dick Gregory got it. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4459.34s)]
*  I don't know how, but I'm pretty sure that someone had sold the footage. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4461.0599999999995s)]
*  They said CBS lost a bidding war with Time Life, so someone had it to sell it. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4464.78s)]
*  But how did they find it? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4469.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm surprised they ever let it out. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4471.9800000000005s)]
*  I feel like the guy who maybe filmed it, or his family perhaps? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4476.9800000000005s)]
*  Abrams the Pruder stood on a concrete pedestal. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4482.9800000000005s)]
*  He filmed the presidential 26 seconds after the Secret Service agent promised the Pruder [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4485.78s)]
*  that the film would only be used for an official investigation. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4492.9800000000005s)]
*  So maybe he came forward, I guess. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4496.259999999999s)]
*  Zapruder gave two of the copies. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4500.259999999999s)]
*  Oh, so he made copies of it himself. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4502.259999999999s)]
*  Smart. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4504.259999999999s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4505.259999999999s)]
*  Smart. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4506.259999999999s)]
*  The original film was retained by Zapruder in addition to one of the copies. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4507.259999999999s)]
*  So, November 23, a bidding for the footage, lost a bidding to Life Magazine for $160,000. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4513.259999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4520.259999999999s)]
*  $1.3 million in 2023. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4521.259999999999s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Dan Rather was the first to report on the footage on national television after seeing it. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4524.7s)]
*  The inaccuracies in his description contributed to many conspiracy theories about the assassination. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4530.7s)]
*  His 2001 book, Tell Me a Story, CBS producer Don Hewitt said that he told Rather to go to Zapruder's home [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4536.7s)]
*  to sock him in the jaw, take the film, copy it, and then return it to let the network's lawyers deal with the consequences. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4543.7s)]
*  According to Hewitt, he realized his mistake after ending their telephone conversation and immediately called Rather back to countermand the offer, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4551.139999999999s)]
*  disappointing the reporter. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4559.139999999999s)]
*  A 2015 interview on OP with Jim Norton Rather stated that the story was a myth. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4561.139999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4568.139999999999s)]
*  It still doesn't explain. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4569.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, how did they get it? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4571.139999999999s)]
*  How did it end up in the movie where you read this? [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4573.139999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4575.139999999999s)]
*  But this is like... [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4576.139999999999s)]
*  Huh. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4578.139999999999s)]
*  Slow down. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4579.58s)]
*  So, it's hard to say. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4580.58s)]
*  So somebody had it. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4582.58s)]
*  I just don't know how Dick Gregory got it. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4584.58s)]
*  I don't know how the gentleman with Dick Gregory got it. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4587.58s)]
*  I assume he brought that guy on. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4590.58s)]
*  Sort of like I would bring a guest on the JRE. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4592.58s)]
*  Like, tell me what's up. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4594.58s)]
*  What happened? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4596.58s)]
*  You imagine back then breaking that piece of news, Geraldo Rivera must have been shitting his pants. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4597.58s)]
*  Like, what have I done? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4601.58s)]
*  Those guys are still alive. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4602.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4604.58s)]
*  Like, it's not like today. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4605.58s)]
*  You talk about the Kennedy assassination today. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4606.58s)]
*  You're talking about someone who died 50... [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4609.0199999999995s)]
*  What is it? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4611.0199999999995s)]
*  Almost 60 years ago. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4612.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a long-ass time. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4613.0199999999995s)]
*  You talk about it in 1975. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4615.0199999999995s)]
*  Those dudes are still running shit. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4617.0199999999995s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4619.0199999999995s)]
*  And to see that on television, like, proof that the story was shady, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4620.0199999999995s)]
*  that must have been a big fucking deal. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4624.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, I don't think we could ever appreciate what it would be like to be a grown-up in 75. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4627.0199999999995s)]
*  It was probably madness. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4632.0199999999995s)]
*  Madness. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4634.0199999999995s)]
*  Man. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4636.0199999999995s)]
*  Everybody's just getting back from Vietnam. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4638.46s)]
*  Like, what the fuck was that all about? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4640.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4642.46s)]
*  Disco. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4643.46s)]
*  Power bottoms. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4645.46s)]
*  Water beds. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4646.46s)]
*  The days. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4648.46s)]
*  No super gonorrhea. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4650.46s)]
*  And the worst car America's ever produced. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4654.46s)]
*  This article about Zapruder says after walking away, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4656.46s)]
*  he ran into a Dallas news reporter who knew, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4660.46s)]
*  who was acquainted with, that's Soros, who was a Secret Service agent. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4663.46s)]
*  And they got them connected almost immediately. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4667.9s)]
*  Mm. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4669.9s)]
*  He, okay. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4670.9s)]
*  Says, offered to bring Soros to Zapruder's office. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4672.9s)]
*  Zapruder agreed and returned to his office. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4675.9s)]
*  McCormick later found Soros outside the sheriff's office at Maine and Houston, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4677.9s)]
*  and together they went to Zapruder's office. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4681.9s)]
*  Zapruder agreed to give the film to Soros on the condition that it would be used [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4683.9s)]
*  only for investigation of the assassination. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4687.9s)]
*  The three then took the film to the television station WFAA to be developed [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4689.9s)]
*  after it was realized that WFAA was unable to develop Zapruder's footage. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4695.339999999999s)]
*  The film was later taken to Eastman Kodiak's Dallas processing plant [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4700.339999999999s)]
*  later that afternoon where it was immediately developed. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4704.339999999999s)]
*  As the Kodachrome process requires different equipment for duplication [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4707.339999999999s)]
*  than for simple development, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4711.339999999999s)]
*  Zapruder's film was not developed until around 6.30 p.m. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4713.339999999999s)]
*  The original developed film was taken to the Jameson Film Company [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4717.339999999999s)]
*  where three additional copies were exposed. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4720.339999999999s)]
*  These were returned to Kodak around 8 p.m. for processing. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4723.78s)]
*  Zapruder kept the original plus one copy and gave the other two copies to Soros [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4727.78s)]
*  who sent them to the Secret Service headquarters in Washington. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4732.78s)]
*  So they had it immediately and he held onto it for like 10 years it looks like, right? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4735.78s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4739.78s)]
*  My next question would be like how did it end up in the auction house? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4741.78s)]
*  Maybe he died and his stuff got taken. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4743.78s)]
*  I feel like that's what I remember. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4745.78s)]
*  I feel like I remember his family having something to do with it. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4746.78s)]
*  Stole a contact with him later that evening. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4748.78s)]
*  Okay, late that evening Zapruder was contacted at home by Richard Stole [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4751.219999999999s)]
*  an editor at Life Magazine. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4756.219999999999s)]
*  They arranged to meet the following morning to view the film [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4758.219999999999s)]
*  after which Zapruder sold the print rights to Life for $50,000. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4762.219999999999s)]
*  Soros was representing Time Life on behalf of the publisher Charles Douglas Jackson [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4767.219999999999s)]
*  the following day, November 24th. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4774.219999999999s)]
*  He purchased all rights to the film for a total of $150,000 [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4776.66s)]
*  which is $1.3 million in today's money. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4781.66s)]
*  The night after the assassinations, Zapruder said that he had a nightmare [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4785.66s)]
*  in which he saw a booth in Times Square advertising, see the president's head explode. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4789.66s)]
*  He determined that while he was willing to make money from the film [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4794.66s)]
*  he did not want the public to see the full horror of what he had seen. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4797.66s)]
*  Therefore, a condition of the sale to Life was that frame 313 [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4802.099999999999s)]
*  showing the fatal shot would be withheld. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4807.099999999999s)]
*  Although he made a profit from selling the film [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4810.099999999999s)]
*  he asked that the amount he was paid not be publicly disclosed. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4813.099999999999s)]
*  He later donated $25,000, about $221,000 today. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4818.099999999999s)]
*  Of the money he was paid to widow of officer J.D. Tippett [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4822.099999999999s)]
*  a Dallas police officer who was shot and killed by Lee Harvey Oswald [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4826.099999999999s)]
*  35 minutes after President Kennedy was killed. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4830.54s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4832.54s)]
*  Okay, so in 75 [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4834.54s)]
*  Time sold the film back to the Zapruder family for $1. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4836.54s)]
*  And in 78 the Zapruders allowed the film to be stored [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4841.54s)]
*  at the National Archives and Records Administration where it remains. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4845.54s)]
*  In 99 the Zapruders donated the copyright of the film [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4850.54s)]
*  to the 6th floor museum at Deeley Plaza. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4854.54s)]
*  So I'm still confused as to how they got it. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4857.98s)]
*  How did Grey-Grey get it? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4862.98s)]
*  Yeah, how did they get it? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4864.98s)]
*  I'll investigate. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4866.98s)]
*  They're coming. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4868.98s)]
*  So I wonder if the one that they showed on Geraldo Rivera's [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4870.98s)]
*  is the one with all the frames. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4875.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4880.98s)]
*  Is that the one with all the frames? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4881.98s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4883.98s)]
*  Huh. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4886.419999999999s)]
*  I wonder if there's a version that has one extra frame. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4887.419999999999s)]
*  Or if that's the version without the frame omitted. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4891.419999999999s)]
*  Either way, it's interesting how blurry it is. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4895.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it looked like shit because I thought it was the time of the video [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4898.419999999999s)]
*  but then when they went back to the guests [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4901.419999999999s)]
*  the guests looked way better than the footage they were showing. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4903.419999999999s)]
*  Well, he was doing a little 8mm. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4905.419999999999s)]
*  They have professional TV cameras in a giant studio [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4907.419999999999s)]
*  with crazy overhead lights and the whole deal. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4910.419999999999s)]
*  Back then cameras sucked. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4912.419999999999s)]
*  They fucking sucked. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4915.86s)]
*  And if you're going to film something, good luck figuring out what the fuck you're filming. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4917.86s)]
*  But even that looked like a copy of a copy of a copy of what that would look like at that time. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4920.86s)]
*  Well, it might have been, right? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4924.86s)]
*  They might have given them the copy and not the original. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4926.86s)]
*  Who knows if the duplicate was even remotely as good? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4928.86s)]
*  Maybe it's like VHS tapes. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4930.86s)]
*  Remember when you could make a VHS tape and then you make a copy of it and it looks like shit? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4932.86s)]
*  Or they filmed it off a TV back then or something? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4935.86s)]
*  Oh yeah, those are the best. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4938.86s)]
*  You would buy movies. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4940.86s)]
*  You would buy a VHS recorder in a movie theater and they would film it on the screen. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4943.299999999999s)]
*  And it would almost fit your screen, but you could buy a brand new movie for five bucks. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4946.299999999999s)]
*  And you're like, okay. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4952.299999999999s)]
*  I watched multiple movies that I bought on the street when I was a kid. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4954.299999999999s)]
*  And then I bought them and it's just a VHS tape of a fucking camera that some guy set up in a movie theater. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4957.299999999999s)]
*  I had a copy of Pulp Fiction the week it came out. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4963.299999999999s)]
*  I thought it was the most awesome thing. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4966.299999999999s)]
*  I could just watch Pulp Fiction all day long in my house. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4968.299999999999s)]
*  Wow, sounds terrible. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4970.299999999999s)]
*  It was a bad copy. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4972.74s)]
*  They're all terrible. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4974.74s)]
*  They showed that guy that we looked up, Grodin's copy of the Zapruder film. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4976.74s)]
*  So he had a copy of the Zapruder film. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4982.74s)]
*  And Dick Gregory was an outspoken opponent critic of the Warren Commission. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4984.74s)]
*  So it sounds like they had a meeting and made up a plan. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=4990.74s)]

*  $14.3 million jackpot he claimed in 1991. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5313.0199999999995s)]
*  There you go. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5315.0199999999995s)]
*  What? [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5317.0199999999995s)]
*  And what was the other time? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5319.0199999999995s)]
*  I hope I'm not making this up. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5321.0199999999995s)]
*  No, it seems like there is something else. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5323.0199999999995s)]
*  I feel like I'm not making it up. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5325.0199999999995s)]
*  And I feel like what the scam was [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5327.0199999999995s)]
*  was... [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5329.0199999999995s)]
*  it was a way to launder money. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5331.0199999999995s)]
*  So, if somebody won the lottery, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5333.0199999999995s)]
*  like say if you won the lottery [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5335.46s)]
*  and you won a million dollars, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5337.46s)]
*  say, listen, I'll give you 1.2, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5339.46s)]
*  and you give that ticket to me. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5341.46s)]
*  And then now I've gotten rid of a million dollars. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5343.46s)]
*  I don't have to... you know what I'm saying? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5346.46s)]
*  Like you can move stuff around. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5348.46s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5350.46s)]
*  That you can say, this is where I got my money from. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5352.46s)]
*  And people can't say shit. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5354.46s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5356.46s)]
*  Because you would even have to give them a million too. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5358.46s)]
*  Because the way the lottery thing works, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5360.46s)]
*  they give you like X amount per year for like forever. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5362.46s)]
*  It's annoying. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5364.9s)]
*  Or you could take all of it at once, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5366.9s)]
*  but you don't get nearly as much, right? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5368.9s)]
*  I always thought that I would do the longer. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5370.9s)]
*  Like just be like, I don't have to ever work again. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5372.9s)]
*  I'll have $100,000 a month. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5374.9s)]
*  Like that's enough, you know? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5376.9s)]
*  But then if you die, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5378.9s)]
*  do your family get that? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5380.9s)]
*  Yeah, probably not. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5382.9s)]
*  It's probably a clause that cuts you off. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5384.9s)]
*  Yeah, so then there's that. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5386.9s)]
*  It's like, you know, you're not around anymore. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5388.9s)]
*  Yeah, we're not paying you. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5390.9s)]
*  What is the difference? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5393.339999999999s)]
*  Say if you win like the Powerball, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5395.339999999999s)]
*  and you win $100 million. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5397.339999999999s)]
*  What's the difference between the payoff [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5399.339999999999s)]
*  and the overtime payments? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5401.339999999999s)]
*  Overtime gets you to $100 million. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5403.339999999999s)]
*  But what's the payoff? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5405.339999999999s)]
*  Like if you want it all at once, you want to go crazy. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5407.339999999999s)]
*  Why would you say this? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5409.339999999999s)]
*  Like you got coke and bullets and you're ready to go. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5411.339999999999s)]
*  You just want to go nuts. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5413.339999999999s)]
*  You want, no, no, no, I want all the money. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5415.339999999999s)]
*  If you're just like some wild dude [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5417.339999999999s)]
*  that all of a sudden gets $100 million [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5419.339999999999s)]
*  and you're like, what is it? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5421.78s)]
*  Like $40 million? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5423.78s)]
*  Like how much is it? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5425.78s)]
*  What would your percent be? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5427.78s)]
*  You'd say 40%? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5429.78s)]
*  I would wonder what the drop off is. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5431.78s)]
*  I'd say 50. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5433.78s)]
*  I think it's half. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5435.78s)]
*  You also have to pay taxes on that half too. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5437.78s)]
*  You have to think of that. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5439.78s)]
*  So you're not really getting $100 million. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5441.78s)]
*  So if they give you 50, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5443.78s)]
*  then what does the government take? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5445.78s)]
*  I bet they take like half. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5447.78s)]
*  For something crazy like a lottery? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5450.219999999999s)]
*  Give me my piece, bitch! [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5452.219999999999s)]
*  $1.35 billion to pay out was $707. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5454.219999999999s)]
*  Yep, that's about 50. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5456.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, somewhere in that range. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5458.219999999999s)]
*  And then how much of that do they have to pay in taxes? [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5460.219999999999s)]
*  Even if they pay half. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5464.219999999999s)]
*  Cha-ching! [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5466.219999999999s)]
*  It's probably like 40%. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5468.219999999999s)]
*  Imagine how many times that guy has to change his phone number. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5470.219999999999s)]
*  The IRS will take 24% off the top [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5472.219999999999s)]
*  and the rest will do it tax time. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5474.219999999999s)]
*  Mmm. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5476.219999999999s)]
*  So it's tax time now. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5478.66s)]
*  So for the $1.35 billion, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5480.66s)]
*  it says... [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5482.66s)]
*  They did the math on this. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5484.66s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5486.66s)]
*  Jump, skip down. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5488.66s)]
*  So at 60 we go... [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5490.66s)]
*  If the cash option is taken at 707, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5492.66s)]
*  you owe $169 million [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5495.66s)]
*  or $170 million in federal taxes. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5497.66s)]
*  Geez Louise! [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5499.66s)]
*  You lost $800 of the $135 million. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5501.66s)]
*  That is pretty wild. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5505.66s)]
*  Isn't it crazy how much the government takes? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5508.099999999999s)]
*  They're like, we would like $169 million please. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5510.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Ukraine's... [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5512.099999999999s)]
*  That's our score. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5514.099999999999s)]
*  So the government wins always. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5516.099999999999s)]
*  Every time someone wins the lottery, the government wins. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5518.099999999999s)]
*  That's a giant win too. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5520.099999999999s)]
*  So the setup is, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5522.099999999999s)]
*  you get a bunch of people, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5524.099999999999s)]
*  they all throw their money at this thing [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5526.099999999999s)]
*  because it's legalized gambling 100%. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5528.099999999999s)]
*  Because no one's limiting the amount of tickets you can buy. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5530.099999999999s)]
*  You can go nutty, right? [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5532.099999999999s)]
*  People go nutty, they buy hundreds of tickets, right? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5534.099999999999s)]
*  And then when you win, the government wins. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5536.54s)]
*  The government gets a stake every time. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5538.54s)]
*  How many lotteries are there? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5540.54s)]
*  How often does that happen? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5542.54s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5544.54s)]
*  So that money's just coming in. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5546.54s)]
*  So the government is basically a casino. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5548.54s)]
*  And they get the best cut of any casino. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5550.54s)]
*  They can't lose. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5552.54s)]
*  It's not like you can win [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5554.54s)]
*  and the house pays you. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5556.54s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5558.54s)]
*  That was the money that came from all you people [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5560.54s)]
*  throwing your money into this thing. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5562.54s)]
*  And then we get paid! [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5564.98s)]
*  They get paid an enormous amount. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5566.98s)]
*  Imagine if you were running for president [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5568.98s)]
*  and you said, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5570.98s)]
*  the government never [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5572.98s)]
*  taxes you on [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5574.98s)]
*  your winnings! [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5576.98s)]
*  No more lottery! [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5578.98s)]
*  Fuck, they didn't play! [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5580.98s)]
*  You put your hard-earned money into that pot! [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5582.98s)]
*  JFK too, coming this summer. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5584.98s)]
*  Can you imagine how quick they'd kill you [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5586.98s)]
*  if you tried to take away that lottery money? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5588.98s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5590.98s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5593.419999999999s)]
*  How many times do they have [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5595.419999999999s)]
*  a 169 million dollar payout like that? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5597.419999999999s)]
*  What is a powerball? How often does that take place? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5599.419999999999s)]
*  Twice a week. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5601.419999999999s)]

*  I don't know. Somebody named Monkey Balls. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5891.82s)]
*  Oh, another dude named Monkey Balls? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5893.82s)]
*  Our guy wasn't a comic. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5895.82s)]
*  Our guy was just a dude [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5897.82s)]
*  that would just hang out there. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5899.82s)]
*  He always had cigarettes, too. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5901.82s)]
*  You'd buy cigarettes from him. Oh, really? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5903.82s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's the case of everything. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5906.259999999999s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5908.259999999999s)]
*  It's such a weird fucking place. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5910.259999999999s)]
*  The fact that it was on Sunset, too. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5912.259999999999s)]
*  Sunset's such a weird place. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5914.259999999999s)]
*  There's so many hopes [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5916.259999999999s)]
*  and dreams. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5918.259999999999s)]
*  There was a thing about that club [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5920.259999999999s)]
*  that no other club will ever be able to recreate. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5922.259999999999s)]
*  That thing was that [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5924.259999999999s)]
*  that was our [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5926.259999999999s)]
*  legitimate launching pad. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5928.259999999999s)]
*  Everybody knew that if you [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5930.259999999999s)]
*  could get there, and if you could make it there, [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5932.259999999999s)]
*  you could actually make it as a comic. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5934.7s)]
*  There was this one place [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5936.7s)]
*  where it was just [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5938.7s)]
*  universally regarded [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5940.7s)]
*  as an epicenter [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5942.7s)]
*  of some of the all-time greats. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5944.7s)]
*  Universally regarded. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5946.7s)]
*  And that it was in Hollywood. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5948.7s)]
*  It was back at the time where [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5950.7s)]
*  that meant you'd be in films [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5952.7s)]
*  and you'd be on television. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5954.7s)]
*  Stand-up was like a pathway [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5956.7s)]
*  to all these other insane worlds [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5958.7s)]
*  that Robin Williams was in now. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5960.7s)]
*  It was just a different place. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5963.139999999999s)]
*  There's no place ever going to be like that. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5965.139999999999s)]
*  No matter what we could do in Austin, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5967.139999999999s)]
*  it's going to be a different vibe. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5969.139999999999s)]
*  You could redo it at that club, man. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5971.139999999999s)]
*  It has so much magic. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5973.139999999999s)]
*  You could already feel the magic. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5975.139999999999s)]
*  You don't redo it, though. You do a new thing. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5977.139999999999s)]
*  But that thing, that one thing, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5979.139999999999s)]
*  part of that thing, the lack of organization, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5981.139999999999s)]
*  the way it was so chaotic, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5983.139999999999s)]
*  that's some of the beauty of that thing. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5985.139999999999s)]
*  Some of the beauty of that thing was the nuttiness of it. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5987.139999999999s)]
*  People would be hanging out in the back, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5989.139999999999s)]
*  at 4.30 in the morning, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5991.58s)]
*  just talking and laughing. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5993.58s)]
*  And then, I'll see you tomorrow. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5995.58s)]
*  And then, we'd come back the next day. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5997.58s)]
*  And it was a party. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=5999.58s)]
*  As much as it was a great place to perform, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6001.58s)]
*  it was a great place to hang out with comics. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6003.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6005.58s)]
*  It really, by design, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6007.58s)]
*  the patio that wrapped around was insane. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6009.58s)]
*  Like, what an architectural monstrosity [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6011.58s)]
*  for artists and creativity. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6013.58s)]
*  Because that's it. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6015.58s)]
*  You're hanging out at a club, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6017.58s)]

*  We know the weather's 80 degrees. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6022.0199999999995s)]
*  You know. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6024.0199999999995s)]
*  It was built for that, perfectly. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6026.0199999999995s)]
*  It used to be, before all the blizzards. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6028.0199999999995s)]
*  The blizzards! [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6030.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, how, it rained like crazy in LA, right? [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6032.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and snowed. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6034.0199999999995s)]
*  Did it snow in LA? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6036.0199999999995s)]
*  It's slated and hailed, so pretty much, kind of. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6038.0199999999995s)]
*  But Burbank, the mountains in Burbank, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6040.0199999999995s)]
*  all snow covered, it was weird. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6042.0199999999995s)]
*  It snowed once back in the day. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6044.0199999999995s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6046.0199999999995s)]
*  I was running with my dogs, and I was running in the hills. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6048.46s)]
*  And as we were running, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6050.46s)]
*  I was like, what is going on? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6052.46s)]
*  This is crazy! [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6054.46s)]
*  And snow was falling. I'm like, this is fucking nuts! [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6056.46s)]
*  And I didn't even have a cell phone back then. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6060.46s)]
*  Or I didn't have a cell phone camera back then. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6062.46s)]
*  I wasn't running with one. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6064.46s)]

*  Bro. Yeah, that's like the day after tomorrow type shit. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6074.46s)]
*  Remember that stupid movie? [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6076.9s)]

*  Yes. Oh my god, it's great. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6080.9s)]
*  Yesterday. I don't know. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6082.9s)]
*  It didn't just jump up to 85 degrees. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6084.9s)]
*  It does that here. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6086.9s)]
*  Well, I typed in Miami snow and it says 46 degrees. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6088.9s)]
*  No, it didn't snow in Miami, bro. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6090.9s)]
*  You're on the wrong TikTok. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6092.9s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6115.339999999999s)]

*  It's good for them knowing what two factor [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6119.339999999999s)]

*  Mmhmm. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6125.339999999999s)]
*  Speaking of which, they finally announced [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6127.339999999999s)]
*  three years later that it was a lab leak out of Wuhan. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6129.339999999999s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6131.339999999999s)]

*  Crazy. New York Times, too. Yeah. Crazy. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6135.78s)]
*  Yeah. Duh. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6137.78s)]
*  After we knew that. Yeah. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6139.78s)]
*  The energy department said it, which is a little weird. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6141.78s)]
*  It's weird. You know what it's like? [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6143.78s)]
*  It's like they're leaking it out slowly [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6145.78s)]
*  so that it's not something that [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6147.78s)]
*  they can never say they figured out. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6149.78s)]
*  Like, if they deny it, deny it, deny it, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6151.78s)]
*  and then it gets to this overwhelming part [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6153.78s)]
*  where everybody realizes it came out of there, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6155.78s)]
*  then it looks horrible. So you just have to, like, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6157.78s)]
*  slowly do it. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6159.78s)]
*  The energy department is such a weird department [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6162.219999999999s)]
*  to do that through. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6164.219999999999s)]
*  Maybe they did the cover up for the Sam Britton thing. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6166.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6168.219999999999s)]

*  Because that's the official government now. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6182.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's like they must have gotten [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6184.219999999999s)]
*  approval to do that, right? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6186.219999999999s)]
*  It's not like there's some rogue agents [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6188.219999999999s)]
*  at the department of energy that's like, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6190.66s)]
*  I know what I'm going to fucking do! [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6192.66s)]
*  I'm going to let everybody know where this virus came from! [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6194.66s)]
*  No, that guy's got a boss. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6196.66s)]
*  It's fucking crazy, dude. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6198.66s)]
*  It's really weird. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6200.66s)]
*  It's really weird that the truth slowly [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6202.66s)]
*  but surely comes out about all this stuff. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6204.66s)]
*  Right. You know? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6206.66s)]
*  And I think that's what's going to happen with East Palestine. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6208.66s)]
*  Yeah. Looking into it, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6210.66s)]
*  it says with low confidence they have concluded. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6212.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6214.66s)]
*  I don't know what that means, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6216.66s)]
*  but they're saying it. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6219.099999999999s)]
*  You know, I don't know what they mean by low confidence. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6221.099999999999s)]
*  It seems so... [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6223.099999999999s)]
*  If you talk to biologists that talk... [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6225.099999999999s)]
*  When Brett Weinstein has broken down [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6227.099999999999s)]
*  why he believes it was a manipulated virus, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6229.099999999999s)]
*  he's saying that [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6231.099999999999s)]
*  because he's a biologist [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6233.099999999999s)]
*  who studied [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6235.099999999999s)]
*  coronaviruses from bats. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6237.099999999999s)]
*  He actually studied [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6239.099999999999s)]
*  the very animal [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6241.099999999999s)]
*  that he's talking about. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6243.099999999999s)]
*  So when he explains why this doesn't make sense [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6245.099999999999s)]
*  and why this... [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6247.54s)]
*  The structure of the thing has been altered. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6249.54s)]
*  When he's doing it, he's doing it [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6251.54s)]
*  from a very scientific perspective. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6253.54s)]
*  When you hear that, it's duh. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6255.54s)]
*  And he said that at the early days. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6257.54s)]
*  And it got him in trouble with YouTube. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6259.54s)]
*  It got him in trouble with a lot of his friends. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6261.54s)]
*  A lot of people got really crazy about it. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6263.54s)]
*  They thought that [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6265.54s)]
*  saying that it was from a lab [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6267.54s)]
*  connected it to China, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6269.54s)]
*  which connected it to Trump saying it came from China, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6271.54s)]
*  which was bad. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6273.54s)]
*  Because Trump called it the China virus [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6275.98s)]
*  and everybody was like, that's racist. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6277.98s)]
*  And so even if you connected to that, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6279.98s)]
*  if you're wrong, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6282.98s)]
*  if you're wrong about that, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6284.98s)]
*  if you're the one that's saying, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6286.98s)]
*  hey, this is a lab leak and it's not a lab leak [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6288.98s)]
*  and you're shaming those people, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6290.98s)]
*  people will get very upset at you. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6292.98s)]
*  So you have to be really fucking clear [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6294.98s)]
*  before you say it came from China for sure, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6296.98s)]
*  from a lab. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6298.98s)]
*  And then when you find out that maybe [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6300.98s)]
*  the United States had a little bit involved [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6302.98s)]
*  in funding that type of research, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6304.98s)]
*  you're like, what? [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6306.98s)]
*  The FBI confirmed it was moderate confidence [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6308.98s)]
*  in 2021. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6310.98s)]
*  Yeah, so the FBI says it too. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6312.98s)]
*  Moderate confidence in 2021. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6314.98s)]
*  And that's a lot better than [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6316.98s)]
*  low confidence. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6318.98s)]
*  Moderate confidence is like, yeah, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6320.98s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6322.98s)]
*  Four other federal agencies have concluded [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6324.98s)]
*  the pandemic began from natural transmission. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6326.98s)]
*  And two agencies are undecided. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6328.98s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6330.98s)]
*  So there's an ideological dispute [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6332.98s)]
*  within the agencies. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6334.98s)]
*  I wonder what the other agencies that think [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6336.98s)]
*  it's coming from natural selection. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6338.98s)]
*  I wonder what their evidence is. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6340.98s)]
*  Because it doesn't seem like there's a lot of evidence [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6342.98s)]
*  that points in that direction. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6344.98s)]
*  Wild the coincidence [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6346.98s)]
*  would be if it started [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6348.98s)]
*  from that in Wuhan, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6350.98s)]
*  which had a coronavirus lab. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6352.98s)]
*  So weird. What are the odds? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6354.98s)]
*  Remember when John Stewart went on Colbert [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6356.98s)]
*  and had that whole rant about it coming from the lab [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6358.98s)]
*  and Colbert tried to step all over it? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6360.98s)]
*  Oh! Oh! [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6362.98s)]
*  You heard of Woody Harrelson on [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6364.98s)]
*  SNL? [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6366.98s)]
*  Did you see that immediately after [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6368.98s)]
*  Woody Harrelson had that monologue [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6370.98s)]
*  on SNL where he's joking around [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6372.98s)]
*  about a drug company [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6374.98s)]
*  forcing you to take their drug? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6376.98s)]
*  Right after it, the next [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6378.98s)]
*  day, there's all these hit pieces. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6380.98s)]
*  Like they were timed. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6382.98s)]
*  Like there's a hit piece in Fox, [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6384.98s)]
*  there's a hit piece in Vanity Fair, there's a hit piece [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6386.98s)]
*  in the [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6388.98s)]
*  New York Times, he's calling them an anti-vaxxer, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6392.74s)]
*  a stoner, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6394.74s)]
*  and he's pushing conspiracy theories. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6396.74s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6398.74s)]
*  He's a joke monologue [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6400.74s)]
*  on SNL about something [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6402.74s)]
*  that makes people laugh. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6404.74s)]
*  Because you can kind of make a weird comparison [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6406.74s)]
*  to those two. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6408.74s)]
*  That's the only reason why the joke works. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6410.74s)]
*  The only reason why it works is because people are thinking it. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6412.74s)]
*  So for you guys to come out [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6414.74s)]
*  and say, oh, conspiracy theories. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6416.74s)]
*  He jokes about [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6418.74s)]
*  a possible conspiracy theory. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6420.74s)]
*  And the one that he's describing [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6422.74s)]
*  is not even a real one. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6424.74s)]
*  He's making a joke [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6426.74s)]
*  about what the real one was like. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6428.74s)]
*  Maybe not the best joke. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6430.74s)]
*  Maybe not the best delivery. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6432.74s)]
*  But the fact that that got this [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6434.74s)]
*  immediate response [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6436.74s)]
*  where all these people defend [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6438.74s)]
*  the pharmaceutical companies. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6440.74s)]
*  They're all jumping in and defending them. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6442.74s)]
*  Like in unison, they're all [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6444.74s)]
*  anti-vaxxer, stoner. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6446.74s)]
*  Instead of [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6448.74s)]
*  saying it sucked, or instead of saying, hey, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6450.74s)]
*  stick to acting. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6452.74s)]
*  They all [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6454.74s)]
*  wanted to jump in to defend the vaccine. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6456.74s)]
*  They all wanted to jump in and defend [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6458.74s)]
*  the pharmaceutical companies from [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6460.74s)]
*  this anti-vaxxer, [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6462.74s)]
*  stoner [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6464.74s)]
*  actor who's talking. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6466.74s)]
*  It's just interesting that they all take [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6468.74s)]
*  that route. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6470.74s)]
*  I get criticized in the monologue, but all [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6472.74s)]
*  of this stuff is just taking that route. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6474.74s)]
*  That's an anti-vaxxer conspiracy theory. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6476.74s)]
*  Is it? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6478.74s)]
*  No, he's joking about a way [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6480.74s)]
*  things went down. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6482.74s)]
*  There's a lot to what he's saying, forcing [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6484.74s)]
*  you to take their drug. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6486.74s)]
*  That kind of was happening. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6488.74s)]
*  And if you weren't getting forced, you were certainly [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6490.74s)]
*  getting coerced. You were getting urged on by [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6492.74s)]
*  the government. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6494.74s)]
*  There was probably a commercial for a medicine right after that. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6496.74s)]
*  Probably right away. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6498.74s)]
*  It's not like they're not spending [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6500.74s)]
*  money on all this stuff. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6502.74s)]
*  Why are we pretending? [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6504.74s)]
*  And so [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6506.74s)]
*  when he makes that joke [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6508.74s)]
*  and he talks about [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6510.74s)]
*  them buying all the media [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6512.74s)]
*  and then all the media [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6514.74s)]
*  responds as if they've been bought and paid for, [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6516.74s)]
*  that's pretty wild. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6518.74s)]
*  There's so many articles [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6520.74s)]
*  written about him, like right away. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6522.74s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6524.74s)]
*  I always look at both sides and [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6526.74s)]
*  CNN had it, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6528.74s)]
*  but also CNN is owned [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6530.74s)]
*  by the same company that owns SNL. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6532.74s)]
*  So it's tricky because they don't want to make [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6534.74s)]
*  them look bad. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6536.74s)]
*  But they, you know, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6538.74s)]
*  angled it like it was him. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6540.74s)]
*  Even though [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6542.74s)]
*  what we know is that these scripts are approved [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6544.74s)]
*  days in advance. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6546.74s)]
*  Yeah, they had to approve that unless he went out and Dave Chappelle [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6548.74s)]
*  did. Yeah, he [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6550.74s)]
*  did. Dave had two different monologues. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6552.74s)]
*  Dave ran one monologue by everybody and killed. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6556.74s)]
*  And they're like, this is great. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6558.74s)]
*  Then he goes out front and reads it. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6560.74s)]
*  Does a whole separate one. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6562.74s)]
*  God bless him. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6564.74s)]
*  God bless him. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6566.74s)]
*  If Woody Harrelson did that, God bless him. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6568.74s)]
*  But, you know, look, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6570.74s)]
*  the fact that everybody jumped in like [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6572.74s)]
*  that was just very interesting. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6574.74s)]
*  I know they're reporters and I know they have [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6576.74s)]
*  to report on things and I know that's a good [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6578.74s)]
*  snarky way to get people to read your article. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6580.74s)]
*  But like [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6582.74s)]
*  that seems coordinated. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6584.74s)]
*  It's a rough one, too, because Woody Harrelson's a badass [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6586.74s)]
*  motherfucker. So it's like someone that's hard [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6588.74s)]
*  to attack. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6590.74s)]
*  I mean, everything he's done is great. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6592.74s)]
*  He's so undeniable, so cool. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6594.74s)]
*  Even his delivery of the thing [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6596.74s)]
*  that wasn't that funny, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6598.74s)]
*  but purposeful kind of [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6600.74s)]
*  was good. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6602.74s)]
*  Yeah, it was good. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6604.74s)]
*  Especially if a guy was not a comic. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6606.74s)]
*  He's doing stand up, essentially. He's doing a monologue. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6608.74s)]
*  Truly one of the best comedic actors. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6610.74s)]
*  Oh my God, man. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6612.74s)]
*  Kingpin? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6614.74s)]
*  Kingpin is amazing. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6616.74s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6618.74s)]
*  God damn that movie's funny. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6620.74s)]
*  He's throwing up every time he pictures her. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6622.74s)]
*  That's the Farrelly Brothers. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6624.74s)]
*  Oh my God, I think that might be their [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6626.74s)]
*  best one. That and Something About Mary. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6628.74s)]
*  I just rewatched that, too. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6630.74s)]
*  Something About Mary is amazing. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6632.74s)]
*  I worked with him. I punched up a [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6634.74s)]
*  script for him. Peter? [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6636.74s)]
*  Yeah, for a new Amazon thing that came out [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6638.74s)]
*  a few years ago. I can't even remember the name of it. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6640.74s)]
*  Anyway, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6642.74s)]
*  I told him that. It was like a moment. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6644.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? I had this thing loaded up. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6646.74s)]
*  I go, Kingpin, by the way, [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6648.74s)]
*  I think that should have [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6650.74s)]
*  had an Oscar without a doubt. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6652.74s)]
*  He goes, I've always thought the same thing. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6654.74s)]
*  He goes, I've always thought [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6656.74s)]
*  it was my best work. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6658.74s)]
*  He has it above Dumb and Dumber, too. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6660.74s)]
*  It's definitely better than that. Kingpin is [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6662.74s)]
*  on another level. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6664.74s)]
*  It's one of the best comedy movies of all time. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6666.74s)]
*  For sure. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6668.74s)]
*  I love the showdown in it. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6670.74s)]
*  Electric Ride Orchestra, that final scene [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6672.74s)]
*  where Bill Murray's hair is slowly [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6674.74s)]
*  fucking going crazy. I mean, that's the thing. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6676.74s)]
*  When we're in the green room. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6678.74s)]
*  When we're in the green room, that's the song we listen to. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6680.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6682.74s)]
*  All around the world. The O2 arena. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6684.74s)]
*  The fucking MSG. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6686.74s)]
*  The comb over when it's flying around. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6688.74s)]
*  Oh my god, the fact that it's about bowling. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6690.74s)]
*  Amish. It's amazing. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6692.74s)]
*  It made me want to have a bowling alley [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6694.74s)]
*  in my house. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6696.74s)]
*  That's my dream. How many people went bowling [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6698.74s)]
*  after they saw that? Fucking everybody. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6700.74s)]
*  And he's got the comb over, too. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6702.74s)]
*  They make it like it's a bowling thing for these guys [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6704.74s)]
*  just trying to keep their hair that they don't have. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6706.74s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6708.74s)]
*  They're making fun of everything. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6710.74s)]
*  Dude, so good. Such a good movie. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6712.74s)]
*  It's so funny, man. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6714.74s)]
*  When he has to have sex with the landlady [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6716.74s)]
*  because he can't afford the rent. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6718.74s)]
*  And then he's throwing up. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6720.74s)]
*  You know, she's the same girl in [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6722.74s)]
*  Something About Mary that played the lady that [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6724.74s)]
*  I didn't really like in too much. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6726.74s)]
*  Oh, is that the same lady? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6728.74s)]
*  Oh my god, that's hilarious. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6730.74s)]
*  Isn't she in Happy Gilmore or something, too? [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6732.74s)]
*  She's in something else, I think. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6734.74s)]
*  I feel like she's like... [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6736.74s)]
*  I'm sure. I'm sure she is. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6738.74s)]
*  She looks so much better than... [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6740.74s)]
*  She was in Insidious. Oh my god. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6742.74s)]
*  She's in the whole Insidious movie. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6744.74s)]
*  I didn't know there was that many of them. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6746.74s)]
*  What's Insidious about? [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6748.74s)]
*  I don't know. How do I not know this? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6750.74s)]
*  I've never heard of it. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6752.74s)]
*  It's about those people... [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6754.74s)]
*  We talked about it with Sam and Colby, but there's [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6756.74s)]
*  this couple that did a bunch of these stories. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6758.74s)]
*  And they've made movies out of all of their interactions. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6760.74s)]
*  Oh, so this is all Poltergeist movies? [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6764.74s)]
*  I think. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6766.74s)]
*  She's... [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6768.74s)]
*  A lead in it. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6770.74s)]
*  Yeah, she plays the badass lady [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6772.74s)]
*  who's not afraid of this. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6774.74s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6778.74s)]
*  That's so weird. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6780.74s)]
*  And so this Insidious franchise... [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6782.74s)]
*  How long has that been going on for? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6784.74s)]
*  A couple years, for sure. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6786.74s)]
*  I've seen one or two of them. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6788.74s)]
*  Are they good? [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6790.74s)]
*  Not awful. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6792.74s)]
*  33%. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6794.74s)]
*  It's not a comedy, it's not a drama. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6796.74s)]
*  Yo, you know what I saw recently that was really wild? [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6798.74s)]
*  Smile. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6800.74s)]
*  Have you seen Smile? [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6802.74s)]

*  They had people showing up at different sporting events. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6816.74s)]

*  There's a lady sitting there smiling. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6874.74s)]
*  You know how bad, if you're on acid, and that happened. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6876.74s)]
*  Dude, I had a fucking mushroom cap last Monday after a show. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6878.74s)]
*  I went to see some music and that's how I felt. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6880.74s)]
*  It was like that. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6882.74s)]
*  I had a weird one. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6884.74s)]
*  I had a weird little, it was a dark little fucking, [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6886.74s)]
*  I'm not doing mushrooms after hosting Kill Tony anymore. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6888.74s)]
*  I learned a weird thing. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6890.74s)]
*  My brain's not working. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6892.74s)]
*  I learned a weird thing. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6894.74s)]
*  My brain's too open and stuff. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6896.74s)]
*  Also, you're probably tired. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6898.74s)]
*  Yeah, exhausted. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6900.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6902.74s)]
*  You're thinking about going to sleep [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6904.74s)]
*  and then all of a sudden mushrooms are like, [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6906.74s)]
*  nope, no sleeping. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6908.74s)]
*  Contemplate humanity. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6910.74s)]
*  Contemplate your existence. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6912.74s)]
*  Contemplate your place and time. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6914.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6916.74s)]
*  No more mushrooms on a Monday for Tony. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6918.74s)]
*  Experience all these life forms. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6920.74s)]
*  Trying to make their way through this realm. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6922.74s)]
*  When you're out in public [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6924.74s)]
*  and you're Truman, it's just such a strange feeling. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6926.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6928.74s)]
*  I don't like it. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6930.74s)]
*  The cool thing about [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6932.74s)]
*  moving to LA so young [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6934.74s)]
*  is that I had so many of those great [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6936.74s)]
*  Joshua Tree trips. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6938.74s)]
*  And that's where I started and I'm like, this is great. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6940.74s)]
*  I'm laughing. I can do this. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6942.74s)]
*  That's one thing that like, Oregon's figured out [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6944.74s)]
*  before California has. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6946.74s)]
*  They made that legal up there. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6948.74s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6950.74s)]
*  Yeah, I read a thing about how [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6952.74s)]
*  legalized prostitution lowers [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6954.74s)]
*  rapes and [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6956.74s)]
*  sexual crimes [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6958.74s)]
*  by an insane percentage. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6960.74s)]
*  This is a new thing that just came out. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6962.74s)]
*  I think legalized prostitution, [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6964.74s)]
*  if we were living in a place that had [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6966.74s)]
*  legalized prostitution always, [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6968.74s)]
*  it had always existed, I think we would [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6970.74s)]
*  all be pretty cool with it. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6972.74s)]
*  I know that sounds crazy because you don't want your daughter [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6974.74s)]
*  or your sister or your mother to do that. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6976.74s)]
*  But I think that, okay, while prostitution [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6978.74s)]
*  itself is legal, many [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6980.74s)]
*  activities associated with it, such as [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6982.74s)]
*  brothels, soliciting in a public place [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6984.74s)]
*  and pimping are illegal, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6986.74s)]
*  prostitution bill 201-1 [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6988.74s)]
*  was introduced to regulate the industry [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6990.74s)]
*  and allow brothels in non-residential [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6992.74s)]
*  areas. Where is this at? [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6994.74s)]
*  Australia. Oh, Australia has [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6996.74s)]
*  rules like that. Yeah. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=6998.74s)]
*  That's like, Jim Jeffries had a joke about that, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7000.74s)]
*  about his dad going to the brothel. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7002.74s)]
*  But it's like, when there's [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7004.74s)]
*  something like that has always existed, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7006.74s)]
*  I think people would [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7008.74s)]
*  just, it would just [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7010.74s)]
*  be a normal thing. But when [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7012.74s)]
*  you try to make something legal [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7014.74s)]
*  that is illegal, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7016.74s)]
*  people think their whole life of something as [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7018.74s)]
*  being a terrible thing and it's illegal. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7020.74s)]
*  Shouldn't be able to do it. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7022.74s)]
*  And so we have it in our head [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7024.74s)]
*  that it's a terrible thing. Because it does have [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7026.74s)]
*  terrible consequences for some people. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7028.74s)]
*  Like prostitution must have bad consequences [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7030.74s)]
*  for some people. And being involved with people intimately [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7032.74s)]
*  that you don't even know for cash. It's dangerous. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7034.74s)]
*  It's weird. It's like, [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7036.74s)]
*  as much as we want to think that it's just [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7038.74s)]
*  like getting a massage, it's a little bit more. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7040.74s)]
*  It's a little weirder. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7042.74s)]
*  Someone's not just rubbing you to make you feel better, [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7044.74s)]
*  they're sexually pleasuring you. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7046.74s)]
*  Should it be illegal? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7048.74s)]
*  Why would it be illegal when it's legal [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7050.74s)]
*  to just have sex with someone for free? [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7052.74s)]
*  Like, gold digging's legal. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7054.74s)]
*  You could fuck some old rich guy and [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7056.74s)]
*  steal his money. That's legal. Like, why [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7058.74s)]
*  shouldn't you be allowed to make a deal [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7060.74s)]
*  with a person? Like, you want a blowjob? [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7062.74s)]
*  I want a thousand dollars. Like, that [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7064.74s)]
*  to me seems like a normal [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7066.74s)]
*  human right. Whether you want to [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7068.74s)]
*  do it or not, both people are consenting. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7070.74s)]
*  It's crazy that you have to. I think it's out of [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7072.74s)]
*  our hands. It should be out of everybody's hands. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7074.74s)]
*  If two people agree [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7076.74s)]
*  and one person says, like, [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7078.74s)]
*  hey, I'll help you move your couch, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7080.74s)]
*  but I want 50 bucks. And you're like, [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7082.74s)]
*  okay, help me move the couch [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7084.74s)]
*  and I'll give you 50 bucks. It's a deal. Like, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7086.74s)]
*  your friend, some neighbor, whatever, it makes a deal with you. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7088.74s)]
*  If you say, hey, you need 50 bucks, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7090.74s)]
*  I want to come in your mouth. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7092.74s)]
*  What do you think? And he's like, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7094.74s)]
*  alright. Like, is that, nobody's going to [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7096.74s)]
*  care about that. Nobody gives a fuck about [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7098.74s)]
*  male prostitution. Zero people [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7100.74s)]
*  care. Zero concern [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7102.74s)]
*  for the male prostitutes. Fucking [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7104.74s)]
*  zero. If you, how many guys [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7106.74s)]
*  are out there worried about all [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7108.74s)]
*  the guys that are blowing gay guys for cash? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7110.74s)]

*  It's like a full podcast. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7424.74s)]
*  I love that. That's actually really funny [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7426.74s)]
*  because how long is the Steve Jobs [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7428.74s)]
*  me podcast? I think it's like 14 minutes [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7430.74s)]
*  or something. Can you imagine if we had Richard [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7432.74s)]
*  Pryor as a guest on Kill Tony? [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7434.74s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7436.74s)]
*  It would be more of a guest [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7438.74s)]
*  on a podcast because having [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7440.74s)]
*  a guest on Kill Tony, you have to respond to [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7442.74s)]
*  the different comedians. It'd be too weird. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7444.74s)]
*  But it's something I saw yesterday. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7446.74s)]
*  It's a fake Conan. Conan Defusion. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7448.74s)]
*  It's using a diffusion [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7450.74s)]
*  app to make Conan. Then [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7452.74s)]
*  his guest. I don't know what it sounds like. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7454.74s)]
*  Sessio Rogan. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7456.74s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. But I promise I won't malfunction [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7458.74s)]
*  and start attacking the audience or anything. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7460.74s)]
*  Speaking of malfunctioning, let's check out my dance moves. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7462.74s)]
*  I mean, it's not good. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7464.74s)]
*  But, yeah. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7466.74s)]
*  It is. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7468.74s)]
*  Every now and then. Although I have [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7470.74s)]
*  to say it's a little weird to smoke with a machine. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7472.74s)]
*  Yeah, I can imagine. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7474.74s)]
*  But seriously, what can you tell us about your [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7476.74s)]
*  latest project? Yeah, it's weird. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7478.74s)]
*  I have a horrible feeling about all this. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7480.74s)]
*  I have a horrible feeling [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7482.74s)]
*  that we are about to enter [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7484.74s)]
*  an era where you will have no [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7486.74s)]
*  idea what's true. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7488.74s)]
*  I have a horrible feeling just watching that. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7490.74s)]
*  Just watching that, I was like, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7492.74s)]
*  that would be a really good [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7494.74s)]
*  way for us to move into some new [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7496.74s)]
*  phase of reality. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7498.74s)]
*  If you had absolutely no idea [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7500.74s)]
*  what was true and what was not. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7502.74s)]
*  You had no idea if someone did say [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7504.74s)]
*  that or if that event actually did take place [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7506.74s)]
*  or CGI. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7508.74s)]
*  Can you imagine if there was a bunch of people out there [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7510.74s)]
*  saying that East Palestine was CGI? [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7512.74s)]
*  Morning, only to find [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7514.74s)]
*  that you weigh two pounds less. Well, I [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7516.74s)]
*  have a theory about that. I think it's because we all [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7518.74s)]
*  have an inner fat man that comes out [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7520.74s)]
*  at night and eats all the snacks. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7522.74s)]
*  It's like a secret nighttime binge that we [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7524.74s)]
*  never even knew about. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7526.74s)]
*  So, COVID-19. His dick just pop out [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7528.74s)]
*  for a second. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7530.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's odd. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7532.74s)]
*  But that's just [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7534.74s)]
*  the beginning, man. This is like [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7536.74s)]
*  the very first [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7538.74s)]
*  implementations of these. This is like [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7540.74s)]
*  Pong. Doot doot doot doot. That's what it's like. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7542.74s)]
*  We're going to get the Unreal 4 engine [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7544.74s)]
*  soon. And that's going to be really [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7546.74s)]
*  weird. It's going to be very weird. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7548.74s)]
*  You're going to be able to never have [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7550.74s)]
*  to have an actor ever again. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7552.74s)]
*  For every movie you do, [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7554.74s)]
*  you could just do Leonardo [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7556.74s)]
*  DiCaprio when he was 39. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7558.74s)]
*  You could do that over and over and over and [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7560.74s)]
*  over again. And no one will be able to tell. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7562.74s)]
*  Like Bruce Willis. Yeah. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7564.74s)]
*  This is a alleyway [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7566.74s)]
*  from Hong Kong recreated in Unreal 5. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7568.74s)]
*  Oh my god. Unreal 5 [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7570.74s)]
*  is fucking [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7572.74s)]
*  incredible. This is really, really [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7574.74s)]
*  Was Unreal 4 the one that we were raving [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7576.74s)]
*  about before? No. That was 5 as well? [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7578.74s)]
*  That's 5 we've been talking about for about a year now. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7580.74s)]
*  Oh, okay. So 5 was the one where they had the woman [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7582.74s)]
*  who was running in the cliffs? [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7584.74s)]
*  Yup. They've been updating it too. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7586.74s)]
*  Fuck, it's amazing. They have this shit in VR. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7588.74s)]
*  Dude, it's so good. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7590.74s)]
*  It's so good. It's crazy. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7592.74s)]
*  The fact that this is all artificial. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7594.74s)]
*  The sounds are artificial. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7596.74s)]
*  Sounds is the easiest thing [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7598.74s)]
*  I think to fake now. Yeah. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7600.74s)]
*  But this is crazy, man. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7602.74s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7604.74s)]
*  It's so photo-realistic. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7606.74s)]
*  And the fact that these guys [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7610.74s)]
*  have been constantly at this [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7612.74s)]
*  since the 90s. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7614.74s)]
*  You know, they've been... [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7616.74s)]
*  When was the very first [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7618.74s)]
*  computer game [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7620.74s)]
*  that had a 3D Doom-style engine? [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7622.74s)]
*  What was the first one? Was it Castle Wolfenstein? [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7626.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Castle Wolfenstein? [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7628.74s)]
*  Was it the first one? [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7630.74s)]
*  I can't imagine there was one before that, but I don't think there was. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7632.74s)]
*  Right. And Castle Wolfenstein [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7634.74s)]
*  was on one very specific [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7636.74s)]
*  platform, right? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7638.74s)]
*  It was just PC, I thought. Was it? [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7640.74s)]
*  I think so. Why did I think it was a DOS [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7642.74s)]
*  game or something like that? 10 games that came before Wolfenstein [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7644.74s)]
*  but these didn't look very good. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7646.74s)]
*  Let me see. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7648.74s)]
*  So that was the first... Doom was the first big one. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7650.74s)]
*  Like, when Doom... [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7652.74s)]
*  Do you know when they came with the name Doom? [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7654.74s)]
*  Remember the movie [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7656.74s)]
*  The Color of Money? When Tom Cruise [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7658.74s)]
*  goes to the pool hall, and [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7660.74s)]
*  this guy was the local hustler, sees Tom [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7662.74s)]
*  he's sitting there with a big smile on his face, [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7664.74s)]
*  he's got a pool cue in his lap, he goes [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7666.74s)]
*  what you got in that case, boy? And he goes, in here? [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7668.74s)]
*  In here? And he opens it up [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7670.74s)]
*  and he goes, Doom. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7672.74s)]
*  Wow. I've never heard that before. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7674.74s)]
*  Yeah. Play that scene. It's a dope scene. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7676.74s)]
*  It's supposed to be a balabushka [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7678.74s)]
*  which is like this very famous pool cue. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7680.74s)]
*  Good game, good game. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7682.74s)]
*  What you got in there? [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7688.74s)]
*  In here? [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7690.74s)]
*  Doom. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7698.74s)]
*  Wow. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7700.74s)]
*  Come on, boy. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7704.74s)]
*  Let's play. Yeah, let's play. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7706.74s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7708.74s)]
*  What a star. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7710.74s)]
*  It's probably the best Tom Cruise movie of all time. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7712.74s)]
*  The Color of Money, Rejuvenated Pool. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7714.74s)]
*  That fucking thing [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7716.74s)]
*  made everybody want to be a pool player. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7718.74s)]
*  Made me want to play. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7720.74s)]
*  That fucking movie was great. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7722.74s)]
*  He played Vince, this [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7724.74s)]
*  crazy pool hustler that [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7726.74s)]
*  Paul Newman's character, Fast Eddie [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7728.74s)]
*  Felson, the original character from The Hustler, [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7730.74s)]
*  makes a comeback in the world of pool. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7732.74s)]
*  He got knocked out of pool [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7734.74s)]
*  by organized crime [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7736.74s)]
*  and that was the end of the movie The Hustler [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7738.74s)]
*  that he could never go back to playing again. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7740.74s)]
*  It was a little bit before my time, but Pool Hall Junkies [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7742.74s)]
*  hit me right at a cool place [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7744.74s)]
*  fresh out of high school into film. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7746.74s)]
*  The problem with Pool Hall Junkies [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7748.74s)]
*  is they can't really play pool. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7750.74s)]
*  When you're watching them play pool, you're like, I'm not buying it. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7752.74s)]
*  When you're watching Tom Cruise play pool, [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7754.74s)]
*  Tom Cruise studied with Mike Siegel. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7756.74s)]
*  Mike Siegel, who was also a left-hander [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7758.74s)]
*  like Tom Cruise is, [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7760.74s)]
*  Mike Siegel taught Tom Cruise how to play pool. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7762.74s)]
*  He taught him how to stroke through the ball. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7764.74s)]
*  He taught him how to get down on the shot [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7766.74s)]
*  and look like a professional pool player. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7768.74s)]
*  You look at him play [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7770.74s)]
*  and it's a little [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7772.74s)]
*  stiff. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7774.74s)]
*  I'm not totally buying it, [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7776.74s)]
*  because I watch a lot of professional pool, [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7778.74s)]
*  but he can play. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7780.74s)]
*  You can see he knows how to run out. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7782.74s)]
*  He's moving the ball around correctly. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7784.74s)]
*  When you're watching Pool Hall Junkies, it's like, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7786.74s)]
*  get the fuck out of here. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7788.74s)]
*  The cast is great, though. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7790.74s)]
*  It's just as a pool player. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7792.74s)]
*  There's only a couple of movies [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7794.74s)]
*  where they did pool correctly. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7796.74s)]
*  And the real ones [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7798.74s)]
*  are The Color of Money and The Hustler. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7800.74s)]
*  It's one of those things [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7802.74s)]
*  where you can't fake whether or not you can do it good. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7804.74s)]
*  It looks weird if you're faking it. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7806.74s)]
*  If you don't really know how to play pool [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7808.74s)]
*  and you're down on the shot, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7810.74s)]
*  you look all fucking goofy and shit. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7812.74s)]
*  Someone can tell right away. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7814.74s)]
*  There's got to be something you do that's like that, right? [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7816.74s)]
*  I was playing with David Lucas. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7818.74s)]
*  I mentioned this to you. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7820.74s)]
*  I was playing with David Lucas. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7822.74s)]
*  He plays so good. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7824.74s)]
*  We were in Houston, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7826.74s)]
*  and we went to a pool hall both nights after all the shows. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7828.74s)]
*  And he doesn't get down at all. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7830.74s)]
*  We were literally laughing. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7832.74s)]
*  Nick was making jokes. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7834.74s)]
*  He's like one of those old Wild West movies [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7836.74s)]
*  where they just sling the guns out. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7838.74s)]
*  He doesn't bend over, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7840.74s)]
*  but he's got a fucking stroke. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7842.74s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7844.74s)]
*  A lot of big guys don't bend over. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7846.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7848.74s)]
*  If you watch the guy named Steve Miseraq, [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7850.74s)]
*  he's one of the greatest of all time. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7852.74s)]
*  And he was a big guy, [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7854.74s)]
*  especially later in his life. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7856.74s)]
*  He did those, I think they were Bud Light commercials. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7858.74s)]
*  Some light beer commercial. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7860.74s)]
*  It was him doing trick shots on a pool table. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7862.74s)]
*  He was a multiple-time world champion. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7864.74s)]
*  In this one, [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7866.74s)]
*  he wasn't too big. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7868.74s)]
*  He was a little bit more of a big guy. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7870.74s)]
*  He was a little bit more of a big guy. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7872.74s)]
*  If he wasn't too big, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7874.74s)]
*  you could see he's a big guy. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7876.74s)]
*  But see how he doesn't get down on the ball [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7878.74s)]
*  like a smaller pool player would. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7880.74s)]
*  Like a guy who's not. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7882.74s)]
*  See, there he is when he's very heavy, [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7884.74s)]
*  late in life. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7886.74s)]
*  If you go to that picture, [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7888.74s)]
*  right there, you see him right there, [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7890.74s)]
*  that's what he looked like later in life. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7892.74s)]
*  So he got very, very big. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7894.74s)]
*  He was still an amazing pool player. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7896.74s)]
*  Even as big as he was, [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7898.74s)]
*  and as hard as it must have been to move around the table, [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7900.74s)]
*  and he would have a ball around you. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7902.74s)]
*  Like, holy shit, he was a master. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7904.74s)]
*  It was like he had this control [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7906.74s)]
*  of where that ball was going. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7908.74s)]
*  It was just beautiful to watch. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7910.74s)]
*  That's why you can't fake in a pool-hall junkies movie. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7912.74s)]
*  You can't fake that. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7914.74s)]
*  So if you're telling me this guy's the killer player [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7916.74s)]
*  and I watch him bang balls around, [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7918.74s)]
*  it's like, god, here. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7920.74s)]
*  My Instagram algorithm's been showing me crazy pool shit. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7922.74s)]
*  I saw a guy make every ball on a break. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7924.74s)]
*  It's not real? [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7926.74s)]
*  No. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7928.74s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7930.74s)]
*  Like, all these breastfeeding videos [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7932.74s)]
*  with like really tick-tocky, [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7934.74s)]
*  like sexy girls breastfeeding, [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7936.74s)]
*  I've been just flooding my... [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7938.74s)]
*  I'm sure somewhere someone must have [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7940.74s)]
*  once made all the balls on the break. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7942.74s)]
*  I'm sure. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7944.74s)]
*  But when you're watching those balls go on the break, [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7946.74s)]
*  one thing that's disturbing to me [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7948.74s)]
*  is that they all seem to be kind of moving in [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7950.74s)]
*  around the same speed. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7952.74s)]
*  That doesn't usually happen. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7954.74s)]
*  This one's not real. No way. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7956.74s)]
*  Well, the last one was kind of slow. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7958.74s)]
*  But I just don't think it's real. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7960.74s)]
*  I think it's fake. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7962.74s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7964.74s)]
*  Oh, no, look at that right there. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7966.74s)]
*  Watch. Now those balls just move again. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7968.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7970.74s)]
*  Yeah, you can see some shit. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7972.74s)]
*  It's missing frame 313. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7974.74s)]
*  They shot all those balls in the holes [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7976.74s)]
*  and filmed them going in. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7978.74s)]
*  But anyway. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7980.74s)]
*  That's it. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7982.74s)]
*  You've been playing pool a lot locally. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7984.74s)]
*  I saw you, some pool players [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7986.74s)]
*  saying that you stopped in. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7988.74s)]
*  No, I just went to watch. They had the Texas Open in town. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7990.74s)]
*  That guy, Fador Ghorst, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7992.74s)]
*  who was on the podcast before, [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7994.74s)]
*  I went to watch him play. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7996.74s)]
*  I just wanted to stop in for a little bit. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=7998.74s)]
*  But it's a long ass pool tournament that goes on all day. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8000.74s)]
*  Why are you showing me people with breastfeeding? [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8002.74s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8004.74s)]
*  It's in your feed? [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8006.74s)]
*  That's your feed? You got breastfeeding on your feed? [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8008.74s)]
*  Why are you getting breastfeeding on your feed? [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8010.74s)]
*  It's a lot of weird... [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8012.74s)]
*  I have never had a breastfeeding video. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8014.74s)]
*  Are you serious? [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8016.74s)]
*  Jamie, what's going on with you? [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8018.74s)]
*  It's going to turn into porn. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8020.74s)]
*  No, it didn't. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8022.74s)]
*  This is because you guys are watching this shit [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8024.74s)]
*  and clicking on it and putting your little [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8026.74s)]
*  waiver over it and all the things. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8028.74s)]
*  I look at shit. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8030.74s)]
*  A lot of Liver King stuff in there, son. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8032.74s)]
*  Is that Natty [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8034.74s)]
*  Liver King? Is that what that's supposed to be? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8036.74s)]
*  Wait, is that him? [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8038.74s)]
*  Yes. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8040.74s)]
*  There's a loophole where they're allowed to show breastfeeding videos on YouTube and stuff. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8042.74s)]
*  There's weird stuff. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8046.74s)]
*  Did you hear about that YouTuber that just got 10 years for it? [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8048.74s)]
*  What happened? [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8050.74s)]
*  She lost her job [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8052.74s)]

*  my god. Oh my god. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8138.74s)]
*  Imagine growing up to find out your mom was doing that [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8140.74s)]
*  while you were a baby. Yeah. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8142.74s)]
*  I wonder why I'm so weirded out by oil. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8144.74s)]
*  Now it's interesting if that baby's going to like [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8146.74s)]
*  be a boob guy or an ass guy growing up. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8148.74s)]
*  I think that's where it comes from. Yeah. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8150.74s)]
*  I wonder. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8152.74s)]
*  How do you explain feet guys? [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8154.74s)]
*  I heard it's from feet. It's when you're a baby [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8156.74s)]
*  crawling around your mom had walking by [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8158.74s)]
*  you all the time. Oh. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8160.74s)]
*  And you start getting little baby boners from your mom's feet. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8162.74s)]
*  Dick rubbing against the carpet. Yeah. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8164.74s)]
*  Or Tom and Jerry. Baby boners. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8166.74s)]
*  Baby boners. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8168.74s)]
*  When you get your first boner, [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8170.74s)]
*  like at what age? [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8172.74s)]
*  That's an interesting, I could [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8174.74s)]
*  kind of see why that might work [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8176.74s)]
*  because like my mom wasn't walking [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8178.74s)]
*  around a lot when I was a little [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8180.74s)]
*  kid and I'm not into feet at all. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8182.74s)]
*  I've always found it like very weird. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8184.74s)]
*  So that kind of makes sense. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8186.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, my mom does [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8188.74s)]
*  I was drinking milk out of her. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8190.74s)]
*  She has gigantic boobs. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8192.74s)]
*  And I love big boobs. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8194.74s)]
*  Makes sense. Yeah, but who doesn't? [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8196.74s)]
*  It's like saying I love money. Who doesn't love money? [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8198.74s)]

*  It's areola size. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8212.74s)]
*  You know, like a lot of people hate like the big [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8214.74s)]
*  giant areolas I love and my mom has [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8216.74s)]
*  the big areolas. Dudes are weird with stuff, [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8218.74s)]
*  right? I think, do you think [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8220.74s)]
*  that comes from porn? Where they're [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8222.74s)]

*  areola size, is that really the deal [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8232.74s)]
*  breaker here? I mean, have you seen the [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8234.74s)]
*  small ones that look like Hans Kim nipples? [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8236.74s)]

*  that he was at a pool party in Florida [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8256.74s)]
*  and he didn't bring a bathing suit so he went [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8258.74s)]
*  in his jeans, but he did [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8260.74s)]
*  have swim goggles that he brought [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8262.74s)]
*  and a drone. So he was in the swimming [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8264.74s)]
*  pool, flying a drone [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8266.74s)]

*  He's a maniac. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8298.74s)]
*  It's one of the cool things about [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8300.74s)]
*  what you guys are doing with Kill Tony [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8302.74s)]

*  in like eight [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8324.74s)]
*  months of being around here. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8326.74s)]
*  Being around here, what's interesting is [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8328.74s)]
*  that our last three regulars, [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8330.74s)]

*  But what's cool is we're kind of [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8336.74s)]
*  the last few weeks getting back to our roots, [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8338.74s)]

*  he's amazing. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8344.74s)]

*  no use of his left arm, he can [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8348.74s)]
*  walk fine, [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8350.74s)]
*  but he's mute, he can't [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8352.74s)]
*  speak at all. So he [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8354.74s)]
*  takes the microphone, puts it on top [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8356.74s)]
*  of a Bluetooth speaker that he already has hooked up, [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8358.74s)]

*  not cursive, [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8370.74s)]
*  he just keeps his thumb, [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8372.74s)]
*  he moves as fast as he can. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8374.74s)]
*  Have you ever been able to swipe? [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8376.74s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't like it, I don't trust it. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8378.74s)]
*  And then he goes voice to text, [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8380.74s)]
*  so it just says out what he [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8382.74s)]
*  wrote. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8384.74s)]
*  But what's cool is that he's only been doing [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8386.74s)]

*  to like really [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8394.74s)]
*  reinforce good things, and [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8396.74s)]
*  he just has [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8398.74s)]
*  no notes at this point, he's just crushing it. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8400.74s)]
*  I gotta say that, [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8402.74s)]
*  because Tom Green told me about him. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8404.74s)]
*  Oh, it's really Tom Green? [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8406.74s)]

*  Tony has been taking hormone treatments to have [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8414.74s)]
*  the figure of a female tennis player. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8416.74s)]
*  That's true, that's actually true. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8418.74s)]
*  And I am not there yet. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8420.74s)]
*  Still I need a lot more, [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8422.74s)]

*  Everything [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8426.74s)]
*  about you reminds me of Peter Pan, [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8428.74s)]
*  except the fact that Peter Pan was less [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8430.74s)]
*  like Tinkerbell than you are. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8432.74s)]
*  He's just laying into me. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8434.74s)]
*  And also Peter Pan didn't throw handicap [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8436.74s)]
*  people off of his stage every once in a while. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8438.74s)]
*  He felt threatened. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8440.74s)]

*  gonna catch, you know what I'm saying? [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8454.74s)]
*  There was a lesbian off the behind [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8456.74s)]
*  deck. That's caution. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8458.74s)]
*  She was awesome. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8460.74s)]
*  And she was a little bit [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8462.74s)]
*  of a condo shy. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8464.74s)]
*  This guy's a bully. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8466.74s)]
*  He really is. Are you from Canada? [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8468.74s)]
*  Is he Canadian? [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8470.74s)]
*  If he had American healthcare he might have caught [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8472.74s)]
*  that shit early. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8474.74s)]
*  I told him last week [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8478.74s)]
*  you can really tell which arm they put the [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8480.74s)]
*  vaccine in. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8482.74s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8486.74s)]
*  And he laughs and he rolls [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8488.74s)]
*  his sense of humor is that of somebody [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8490.74s)]
*  that's been doing stand up for 20 years. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8492.74s)]
*  It's insane. The green room hang. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8494.74s)]
*  I actually ended up [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8496.74s)]
*  I was [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8498.74s)]
*  at one of these bars. My friends [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8500.74s)]
*  were playing music and it was [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8502.74s)]
*  packed. I mean unbelievable [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8504.74s)]
*  fire hazard. People dancing on picnic tables [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8506.74s)]
*  shoulder to shoulder. It was chaos. I wanted to get [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8508.74s)]
*  out of there. Everybody wanted to get out of there. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8510.74s)]
*  And I look and I see him leaning against [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8512.74s)]
*  the fence in the back. No drink. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8514.74s)]
*  Like he had just come in through the back door. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8516.74s)]
*  I can't move. Can't get in. I go. I get him a drink. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8518.74s)]
*  And we end up hanging out [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8520.74s)]
*  for hours having the best time [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8522.74s)]
*  because it turns out he's a great [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8524.74s)]
*  fucking communicator [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8526.74s)]
*  and hang because when you're [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8528.74s)]
*  at loud bars or a concert he [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8530.74s)]
*  just fucking shows you. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8532.74s)]
*  And you're like oh. You read [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8534.74s)]
*  what he's saying instead of me going what? [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8536.74s)]
*  So he's all doing it one handed. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8538.74s)]
*  And he's just swiping [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8540.74s)]
*  all the words. So how quick can he get a [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8542.74s)]
*  sentence out? Pretty good. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8544.74s)]
*  You could tell that the technology [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8546.74s)]
*  isn't where it needs to be [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8548.74s)]
*  for someone flying [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8550.74s)]
*  through their thoughts with only their [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8552.74s)]
*  thumbs. Especially with one hand. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8554.74s)]
*  Most people are doing it with two hands. He mentioned [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8556.74s)]
*  last night in the green room specifically that [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8558.74s)]

*  in the field of [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8562.74s)]
*  whatever you would call that. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8564.74s)]
*  And what's cool though he has a lot of responses [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8566.74s)]

*  So I told him I would make him a sound board [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8572.74s)]
*  but that's pretty much you know if you had [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8574.74s)]
*  your whole thing where it's just a sound board [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8576.74s)]

*  You know they emerge out of Kill Tony and they have [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8692.74s)]
*  real careers. Like it's I think it's the best [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8694.74s)]
*  launching pad for beginning comics [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8696.74s)]
*  that's ever existed. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8698.74s)]
*  I don't think there's anything like it. Because like [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8700.74s)]
*  the Tonight Show is never for comics that just [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8702.74s)]
*  started out. It was for like guys who put [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8704.74s)]
*  together like a career [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8706.74s)]
*  and then they're finally going to get their first letterman. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8708.74s)]
*  You know that's what that was. It was like you're doing stand up [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8710.74s)]
*  seven eight nine ten years by then right? [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8712.74s)]
*  But this is like guys that are just starting [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8714.74s)]
*  and it's such a ballsy move. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8716.74s)]
*  When you got people like Allie Mokovsky who go from [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8718.74s)]
*  doing a minute every week [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8720.74s)]
*  when she was like how old was she? [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8722.74s)]
*  19 when she first got on the show. Crazy. Crazy. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8724.74s)]
*  To [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8726.74s)]
*  you know doing giant fucking [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8728.74s)]
*  places with us. Wild. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8730.74s)]
*  And now headlining on the road. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8732.74s)]
*  It's really weird. It's really [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8734.74s)]
*  weird to see. It's cool. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8736.74s)]
*  You know it's like because it's [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8738.74s)]
*  happened before [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8740.74s)]
*  where people you've seen them go from open [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8742.74s)]
*  miker to being a successful comedian. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8744.74s)]
*  But it seems to happen [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8746.74s)]
*  more regularly [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8748.74s)]
*  and more [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8750.74s)]
*  it's like there's a path. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8752.74s)]
*  It seems like there's an actual path now. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8754.74s)]
*  And that's one of the things [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8756.74s)]
*  I think something like Kill Tony provides. It's like [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8758.74s)]
*  now people say look what [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8760.74s)]
*  everybody's done. Look what Hans Kim has done. Look what William Montgomery's done. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8762.74s)]
*  Look what David Lucas has done. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8764.74s)]
*  There's a fucking clear path. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8766.74s)]
*  And if you can get on that show and do well [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8768.74s)]
*  and then get on it again and do well again [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8770.74s)]
*  like dude. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8772.74s)]
*  And unlike The Tonight Show and America's Got [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8774.74s)]
*  Talent and Last Comic Standing there's no [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8776.74s)]
*  notes. You don't have to be clean. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8778.74s)]
*  You know it's just about being funny. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8780.74s)]
*  Both Aaron Belial. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8782.74s)]
*  Jared Nathan. William [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8784.74s)]
*  David. Hans. They all push [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8786.74s)]
*  the limits. This is like what comedians [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8788.74s)]
*  know is [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8790.74s)]
*  you know what people want to see. They want to [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8792.74s)]
*  go have fun. They want to have a naughty night. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8794.74s)]
*  They don't need it woke and [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8796.74s)]
*  you know. You can't do [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8798.74s)]
*  woke in a minute. It's not going to work. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8800.74s)]
*  Like this whole idea that you're going to project [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8802.74s)]
*  your social values onto the audience and it's going [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8804.74s)]
*  to make them like you more and agree with you more [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8806.74s)]
*  and get some clout. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8808.74s)]
*  We had a girl that came on yesterday. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8810.74s)]
*  She was like six foot [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8812.74s)]
*  four purple hair. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8814.74s)]
*  You know I mean it just [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8816.74s)]
*  it seemed dangerous. I'm like [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8818.74s)]
*  oh boy here we go. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8820.74s)]
*  And then she's just talking about how she [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8822.74s)]
*  gives the craziest blowjobs [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8824.74s)]
*  and all this. I'm like oh thank God. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8826.74s)]
*  Whew. That was close. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8828.74s)]
*  That's just an odd [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8830.74s)]
*  look. Yeah. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8832.74s)]
*  The social justice comedy [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8834.74s)]
*  you just can't really do it in a minute. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8836.74s)]
*  You have a minute to just do the thing [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8838.74s)]
*  that you want. What you want to do is when you see [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8840.74s)]
*  someone go up there and have a minute [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8842.74s)]
*  that fucking kills and the professional [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8844.74s)]
*  comedians are clapping and you're clapping [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8846.74s)]
*  and you're like that's really good. How long you been doing it? [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8848.74s)]
*  That's what everybody wants. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8850.74s)]
*  And if you can get that going man. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8852.74s)]
*  It's a beautiful cornerstone [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8854.74s)]
*  to comedy because it's like the perfect [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8856.74s)]
*  like the perfect [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8858.74s)]
*  launching pad but also like the perfect [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8860.74s)]
*  I don't want to say battle [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8862.74s)]
*  ground but it is kind of a battle [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8864.74s)]
*  ground from your own ideas. You got to figure out [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8866.74s)]
*  how to really just make it funny. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8868.74s)]
*  When you're putting a set together [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8870.74s)]
*  maybe try it one time and you realize [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8872.74s)]
*  it's too much words or you're setting it up [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8874.74s)]
*  or it's too clunky. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8876.74s)]
*  You'll figure it out. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8878.74s)]
*  But you're duking it out [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8880.74s)]
*  with all these other people that are trying to do it too. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8882.74s)]
*  So there's like a lot of pressure. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8884.74s)]
*  So you're only going to get one minute and there's a hundred [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8886.74s)]
*  people plus signing up for [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8888.74s)]
*  a few spots. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8890.74s)]
*  It's random. Like when you decide to reach [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8892.74s)]
*  into that bucket who the fuck knows who you're going to get? [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8894.74s)]
*  You're just looking in there. You're not even looking. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8896.74s)]
*  You're just putting your hand in there. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8898.74s)]
*  Pulling something out. That's where we found every single one of them. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8900.74s)]
*  It's totally random. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8902.74s)]
*  It's totally random and some guys get to go up more [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8904.74s)]
*  than once. Some girls get to go up more than once. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8906.74s)]
*  It's a building [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8908.74s)]
*  ground that's not like anything else [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8910.74s)]
*  that's ever been around before. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8912.74s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8914.74s)]
*  Just last week we had Roseanne on [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8916.74s)]
*  and she's telling [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8918.74s)]
*  these people one after the other [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8920.74s)]
*  the most perfect advice. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8922.74s)]
*  Just clear cut [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8924.74s)]
*  like [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8926.74s)]
*  wisdom that you just [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8928.74s)]
*  cannot make up. You can't write it. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8930.74s)]
*  And even the people that were doing [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8932.74s)]
*  good, she's like yeah you could do good [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8934.74s)]
*  doing jokes like that or [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8936.74s)]
*  that tells me that you could do even better [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8938.74s)]
*  by looking within yourself. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8940.74s)]
*  If you're doing that with [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8942.74s)]
*  being that surface level [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8944.74s)]
*  then what do you really have inside? [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8946.74s)]
*  And she was just crushing [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8948.74s)]
*  and who better in the [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8950.74s)]
*  world than Roseanne Barr? [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8952.74s)]
*  Someone that literally did that. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8954.74s)]
*  She took her own thing. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8956.74s)]
*  She wasn't like everyone else. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8958.74s)]
*  She still isn't like anyone else. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8960.74s)]
*  And she showed [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8962.74s)]
*  that you could have a crazy career [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8964.74s)]
*  by just being yourself [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8966.74s)]
*  and writing what you know, the story [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8968.74s)]
*  that you can tell. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8970.74s)]

*  man. You guys have put together something really cool. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8974.74s)]
*  She offered a full time mentorship [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8976.74s)]
*  to that Aaron Belial kid. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8978.74s)]

*  Oh yeah I didn't even realize I did that. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=8992.74s)]

*  Always working on new stuff. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9012.74s)]
*  It's one of the cool things about Ron White. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9014.74s)]
*  Never sleeps. I couldn't believe it. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9016.74s)]

*  He's pumped. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9028.74s)]
*  It's happening. It's wild. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9030.74s)]
*  Hanging around there today was eerie. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9032.74s)]
*  Why is that? [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9034.74s)]
*  It just feels so real. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9036.74s)]
*  It's about to happen. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9038.74s)]
*  We've been talking about this for two years. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9040.74s)]
*  We had a place [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9042.74s)]
*  originally and that fell apart. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9044.74s)]
*  And then we found this perfect spot. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9046.74s)]
*  And then we realized that we had [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9048.74s)]
*  to renovate it and do it the right way. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9050.74s)]
*  We'd get one shot at this. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9052.74s)]
*  Let's not half ass this thing and half open it up [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9054.74s)]
*  all fucked up. Let's do it the best [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9056.74s)]
*  we can do it. It's so you also. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9058.74s)]
*  There's so many little touches that you know [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9060.74s)]
*  like quotes with Diaz on it [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9062.74s)]
*  and stuff like that. Yeah there's a quote [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9064.74s)]
*  right when you're leaving the green room [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9066.74s)]
*  it's in neon and it says get it [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9068.74s)]
*  together bitch. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9070.74s)]
*  Joey used to say that every time [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9072.74s)]
*  you were going to go on stage. Get it together bitch. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9074.74s)]
*  And the bar in it is so [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9076.74s)]
*  beautiful now. Spaceships. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9078.74s)]
*  Yeah it's pretty dope. We're excited. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9080.74s)]
*  So that'll be happening soon. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9082.74s)]
*  And we were going over where to do [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9084.74s)]
*  Kill Tony there. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9086.74s)]
*  Where we're hanging out there today. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9088.74s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9094.74s)]
*  They did an amazing job putting this [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9096.74s)]
*  together. So [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9098.74s)]

*  It's pretty wild. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9104.74s)]
*  It's been a lot of fun boys. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9106.74s)]

*  It's such a good community. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9116.74s)]
*  We're so lucky. We're so lucky that [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9118.74s)]
*  we picked the right time and the right place [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9120.74s)]
*  and it all came together like there was a [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9122.74s)]
*  giant magnet drawing us here. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9124.74s)]

*  Monday night and watching that rabid crowd. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9134.74s)]
*  I mean you guys have some of the [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9136.74s)]
*  most excited fans. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9138.74s)]
*  They're so pumped for those shows. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9140.74s)]
*  It's like [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9142.74s)]
*  when I was there people had flown in from [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9144.74s)]
*  Berlin. Like what? [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9146.74s)]
*  You guys flew in from Berlin? [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9148.74s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9150.74s)]
*  It's weird when you think about where you guys started. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9152.74s)]
*  You know? Remember those belly room [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9154.74s)]
*  shows? I remember doing [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9156.74s)]
*  those back in the day. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9158.74s)]
*  And to go from the belly room to what's [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9160.74s)]
*  happening now. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9162.74s)]
*  The small room at the ice house I think was your first [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9164.74s)]
*  appearance. I think you're right. The little room. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9166.74s)]
*  That's right. Oh my god have you seen the [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9168.74s)]
*  ice house rebuild? No. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9170.74s)]
*  It just opened back up. It looks like a [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9172.74s)]
*  whole different place. Where my studio [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9174.74s)]
*  used to be. I think they made that [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9176.74s)]
*  like a whole waiting room. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9178.74s)]
*  They just did everything. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9180.74s)]
*  It's been millions of dollars. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9182.74s)]
*  Lakers guy has tons of money. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9184.74s)]
*  Is there a video of what the new ice house looks like? [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9186.74s)]
*  I think on their Instagram they had it. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9188.74s)]
*  I was worried that they were going to ruin [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9190.74s)]
*  that room. Because that room was so good. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9192.74s)]
*  It really was. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9194.74s)]
*  I don't know what they did. I hope they didn't [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9196.74s)]
*  glitz it up too much. There was something [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9198.74s)]
*  about that room. There was the [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9200.74s)]
*  grittiness to that room that was similar to the [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9202.74s)]
*  grittiness from the Comedy Store. Just different. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9204.74s)]
*  It's like the suburb version. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9206.74s)]
*  There was like a [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9208.74s)]
*  look how beautiful it is. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9210.74s)]
*  Was that Margaret Cho? She's so funny. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9212.74s)]
*  I like her. And so what does it look like [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9214.74s)]
*  outside of the stage? [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9216.74s)]
*  Because the stage is hard to see. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9218.74s)]
*  They had a video of them [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9220.74s)]
*  walking around. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9222.74s)]
*  Bill Burr was just there the other day. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9224.74s)]
*  I think it's before this. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9228.74s)]
*  It's been open for how long now? [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9234.74s)]
*  About two weeks I think. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9236.74s)]
*  Good lineups. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9238.74s)]
*  Bill Burr, Pete Holmes. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9240.74s)]
*  It's supposed to go out there. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9244.74s)]
*  I used to do the Secret Show all those years. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9246.74s)]
*  That's where Thunder Pussy started. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9248.74s)]
*  Thunder Pussy. Which I want to bring back. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9250.74s)]
*  I think about that [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9252.74s)]
*  fucking name. I'm going to make that [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9254.74s)]
*  something. That should be something. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9256.74s)]
*  Thunder Pussy was one of the best names ever. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9258.74s)]
*  My favorite. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9260.74s)]
*  It's been a wild ride boys. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzUDRwCVgs&t=9264.74s)]
