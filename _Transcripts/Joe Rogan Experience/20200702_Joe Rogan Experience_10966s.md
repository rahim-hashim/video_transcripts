# Joe Rogan Experience #1501 - James Lindsay
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 02, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNW3I1FZ5o)
*  Do what you can ride an elephant in Thailand I rode an elephant in Thailand nice
*  It was actually there were actually healthy happy elephants that were well taken care of because it's an elephant rescue
*  So they're free. They're free elephants
*  They wander around they mean they literally came out of the mist in the jungle like like a movie
*  It was crazy, and they're treated really really well, so I didn't like the riding apart
*  Those kind of fucked up, but they don't give a fuck man you you are literally like a hat to them
*  Yeah, they're huge. Yeah strong, but they came over and
*  the whole idea was you pay for this experience with the elephants and
*  In that they rehabilitate these elephants, and they've released many of them back to the wild
*  That's good stuff because they can they don't need to be trained to be able to just eat vegetables and let them right vegetation
*  So they came over and you were introduced to the elephant that you're gonna take care of for the day
*  And then you start feeding it sugarcane, and they love you so you're feeding them and you touch them
*  They're super gentle like the most gentle creatures, and then you actually clean them off you washed them off
*  And you you know you so there's like this grooming thing and then when you go to get on them
*  They know you're trying to get on them so they actually lift their leg up like this so you could step
*  And then you step on them and you climb on top of them
*  It's difficult like it's hard it's hard to ride them
*  But they literally don't give a fuck if you're on them because you're so light to them
*  And then they make their way through the jungle, but it was pretty cool. That's not yeah. It was pretty cool. It's pretty cool
*  it was um
*  It's humbling you know but that's that's the only way I'd want to be around them other than in the wild like I get
*  Bummed out at zoos. I do too. That's I mean that's my story right so I've been yelled at for that
*  That's like the story of 2020 is getting yelled at for everything
*  But I wrote it when I was a kid you could ride elephants at the zoo
*  And so I don't know people got mad at you for that
*  I mean I told the story one time people like lost their minds on me because I guess it's not okay now
*  It was like a cost of dollars. They weren't rehabilitating elephants or doing anything good with it
*  I was like seven though, so I don't really remember it, but it's like times have changed
*  You put your mad at you for something you did when you were little which is funny
*  That's one of the things that's going on now is people retroactively getting cancelled for things
*  Yeah, they like they did when there were kids. Yeah, it's ridiculous
*  I mean it's like everything's a permanent stain on on you. There's no growth. You can't become a better person
*  What do you think that is like? What's what's what is the?
*  Desire that people have to do that like where's that coming from well?
*  You know there's there's two ways we could talk about it
*  We could talk about the psychological side of it
*  which is like a moral purity thing that's going bonkers or we could talk about it in terms of
*  The the idea is the theory that's fueling this and that's all about
*  That has this idea that that comes from French
*  philosophy that words and ideas and thoughts and patterns have traces that don't ever really go away and
*  So if something you know used to be associated with something bad
*  And we still use the word or even if you pretend that it was the case
*  And you still use the word then it carries this negative trace
*  The moral panic and the psychology side of it's fueled by this kind of like stupid idea that words always have to mean
*  Kind of what they meant in the first place are people aware of that though is it I mean is this just
*  Conveniently connected to it or conveniently similar. I mean you think that people are actually aware of this concept
*  I don't think they I don't think most people do it like there's this with so you know we're generally talking about this
*  Whatever woke thing that's happening right and so you got to think of woke kind of like kind of like a church, right?
*  Like you got I grew up Catholic
*  So it's like you got cultural Catholics like they kind of go to church and maybe they go to confession sometimes and they don't really
*  Do they do it, but they don't really do it
*  And then you have like the hard cores like I had a friend in high school that like took notes at church
*  Right. I'm like
*  What you take notes and then you know
*  You've got the pastor and he obviously studies it or the priests in a Catholic context and they study it and then you've got
*  the theologians that really study it and
*  So the stuff I'm talking about is like theology level like that's like the scholars and then your average person just wants to feel
*  Like a good person. So you've got like the woke
*  Academics like the seriously the woke people that are teaching it to kids
*  Yeah, that really teach it as like critical theory like critical race theory. That's right
*  Yeah, so those those the ones that are probably aware of all the nonsense
*  They're making the nonsense actually is I think they pick some of it up from culture
*  you know from activist groups or whatever, but then they refine it and turn it into something and it you know has this really
*  weird feeling to it like
*  You get the impression that it's like they're wrestling with their inner demons and they're like writing it down
*  Yes, like it like this book now white fragility, right Robin D Angelo's book white fragility. It's that's the one that Matt
*  I be destroyed. Yeah
*  God for Matt. I mean, yeah, thank you baby Jesus and Odin. That's right
*  It's so good though because he's right. He's actually right about it. So
*  If you read the book there's all these weird vignettes that she tells these stories she's like
*  oh, I went to this potluck for work and
*  I'm walking around I walk up and then I see there's two parties and we're at the park and there's two groups of people one
*  Of them's all black and one of them's not and I had this moment of panic
*  That I might have to be in the all black group and it's like lady
*  What's going on, you know, and then it's like all white people are racist is like her conclusion from this and it's like maybe it's you
*  She
*  So she had this panic that she was gonna have to party at the park with black people
*  Yeah
*  And she was worried that she was racist because of that and therefore all white people are racist
*  See, that's what I'm thinking is going on, right?
*  So I'm thinking I've thought this for a number of years is that a lot of this stuff where you get these like woke
*  Activists doing their blogs or these scholars writing this stuff down is that they're looking at their own lives
*  So you have these people that are like they're walking down the street, you know, maybe whatever they walk into the hotel
*  They walk into the restaurant and they're like I saw a black guy and then it's like I'm not supposed to notice that and then they
*  Start having like this thing in their head and then they go write an angry blog about how terrible racism is because they're wrestling with
*  It themselves. It's like Sigmund Freud, right? He had that whole idea
*  That everybody wants to have sex with their mothers and like your psychology is all how you resolve that problem and it's like maybe you just
*  Wanted to have sex with your mother Sigmund Freud, you know
*  And then now it's everybody's a racist is kind of the the vibe of the new thing and there's like this weird religious
*  Kind of thing happening around it
*  That's really the thing that gets me is how similar this is to religious or religion
*  Not just really religious ideology like how rigid it is
*  But also indoctrination like religious cults how they indoctrinated people and one of my friends Kurt Metzger really funny guy who
*  Was a Jehovah's Witness when he was younger and so he's really really really sensitive to this stuff
*  He's like I know where this is going. Yep, like this is the same thing that I got when I was in the Jehovah's Witness
*  This is right cult shit. Yeah, it's it's these rigid ideologies that cannot be challenged
*  You can't in any way veer from the course. That's right, and they set you up, right?
*  So every single single one of these things sets you up. So for example
*  I
*  One of my favorite examples these kind of like setups, right?
*  historically in the book I talk about
*  Historically, you know the black feminists came along and they're like, oh feminism is too white feminism
*  Isn't paying attention to black feminist issues or black women's issues
*  And so then these feminists were like, oh we have to fix that, you know
*  They start writing about black issues to the best of their ability and then three years later the lady writes a paper saying
*  Oh, you're just
*  Sticking black things in and it's fake and you're tokenizing it and you're fetishizing it and it's like so you can't do it, right?
*  There's that is called the indoctrination. Yeah, so it's like you and I could be you know
*  Talking about something like this and you could say something
*  I'm like don't you think it's a little bit racist and then the next step is like what are you gonna say?
*  You're gonna say yes or no if you say yes now you've owned it, right?
*  Yeah, now you're like racist and so I'm like, well do you interrogate your racism?
*  Do you spend time working on that and see you see you could dragging people into it
*  yeah, if you say no, I can say well one of the symptoms of
*  participation in systemic racism is
*  An inability to see it if you're white and it's invisible to you
*  And so maybe you need to look harder when it seems like you're getting a little defensive
*  You know, and it's our panic and then you start panicking and when you start to panic when you start to stress out
*  They're like in it literally this lady emailed me the other day this this Indian woman
*  I get a lot of I get insane number of emails about from India. No, no from Canada
*  but an insane number of emails from people who are in different different like
*  Levels of stress with different things that are happening in their lives around this woke explosion that's happened
*  You know in the last month or so so this lady's like I had to go through a brown fragility training at work
*  What yeah brown fragility is a thing. So it's not even black now. It's they're working their way down to brown people
*  Brown people have for job. I was poor people so people who racially were sort of like Switzerland like Indians
*  Like in India like no one ever thought they were racist right never you would never hear about racist Indians, right?
*  Maybe Russell Peters would joke around about it, right? You know Russell the comedian
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Now you hear about it and what they're doing is that they had that what happened was they explained to the ladies or not?
*  The lady there's like the whole group
*  In a room, you know in front of a bunch of people and they explained
*  Brown people in general like it's some kind of block of brownness or whatever
*  Brown people have anti-black racism too and that upholds white supremacy
*  Oh my and then they start just doing this and it's almost like cold reading, right? Yeah, you know like the Edwards guy
*  Whatever that guy's name show and so it's like they cold read and they wait for somebody to start looking like they're getting the sweat
*  Or something happening and then they say now what we need to do now
*  We've introduced this idea of
*  Your brown fragilities we need to in your anti blackness
*  We need to interrogate the feelings that came up and suddenly go one by one through the room
*  And made every single one of them confess their feelings like who's not going to participate and here's that double bind because it gets to
*  You right? And so what do you say you say? Well, I don't really know what you're talking about
*  Well, they're gonna say you're hearing it. Yeah, exactly
*  And then if you confess to it, then then you're falling in so this is straight-up cult indoctrination stuff
*  It really is like those people in Game of Thrones
*  You remember those those people that almost like took over the crown and kidnapped Cersei that that it is
*  Yeah, it's like that sort of pattern for whatever reason just seems to reoccur with humans
*  You know, and I think it comes down to our natural religious impulses
*  Yeah, that I think I mean, you know pretty well from my background, you know, I don't believe in God
*  I'm an atheist. How dare you? Oh, well, you know we get along and so
*  It's like I still do think that we have certain impulses underneath that lead people to build religious structures
*  Around themselves and have religious, you know thoughts and feelings and want to have spiritual development and all of this
*  And so religions can kind of do one of two things, you know
*  I used to be kind of hard-ass about religion and like tough like, you know angry atheist kind of picture
*  but thought about it more and what you're not allowed to think about things and change your mind now, but I did and
*  What I realized is that some religions look up they're like looking at God and they're afraid of sin
*  But they they're paying attention to God. They're thinking about renewal. They're thinking about redemption
*  They're thinking about forgiveness and then some religions look down and all they do is look at the sin
*  And they focus on the sin and that's where the witch hunts came from
*  That was when the Calvinists got like, you know fire and brimstone Jonathan Edwards screaming, you know
*  Sinners in the hands of an angry God
*  You're hanging on a spider's thread above the fires of hell and God should knock you into it because everybody's full of sin
*  Next thing, you know, they're killing witches. So it's like you start focus if you look up, you know
*  Then religion can be great. It can actually lead people if they spiritual development community so on
*  But if you're looking down you're gonna start obsessing about
*  Everybody if you're obsessing about sin, you're gonna start obsessing about everybody else's sin too. Yes, cuz you're gonna want to like
*  There's this feeling with again reading Robin d'Angelo's white fragility is this feeling like
*  That she doesn't want to feel alone like she has these struggles and she doesn't want to be alone
*  So she's a white lady. Oh, yeah
*  Robin d'Angelo's a white lady who goes in and for like $12,000 pop does these corporate seminars?
*  What? Yeah 12 12 grand for two hours and teaches she goes and tells white people that they're racists and then like
*  Interrogates their feelings when they when they get defensive about it. Oh my goodness
*  It's like the biggest corporate corporate training hustle ever and her idea white fragility. You can't disagree with it
*  there's no way to disagree I've absolutely like
*  Rammed it on some people on Twitter or these Wokeys that come and try to trash me and I just say
*  You know that looks a little bit like white fragility and I give some reason that's kind of out of the literature and then they're like
*  I can't have white fragility, you know, I'm whatever and it's like, oh, that's definitely you're getting defensive
*  Defensive is one of the symptoms of white fragility
*  You just want to deny your complicity in the system of racism that you benefit from and it's it's just like
*  You can't get away from it because the kind of language like what you just said is like it like you
*  That's like a checkmate. It's it's like it's like the kind of stuff like so the other day, right?
*  Stephen King got dragged into this with a whole trans thing. Yeah, how did he get dragged into that? What happened?
*  Oh, so he he's a long time been a supporter of JK Rowling. JK Rowling has decided that she's had enough of this, you know
*  trans rights thing going after the
*  women's issues
*  And so at first Stephen King stood up for and and and she put out a tweet saying, you know
*  You're such a good friend blah blah blah
*  And then somebody came after him and he's like trans women are women and it's like, you know
*  He just caved like just immediately caved and it's like all awoken no play make Steve a dull boy, you know
*  it's so he caves and then
*  You get this sense that it's like something out of one of the novels he would have wrote
*  Yeah, right like all of a sudden it's like needful things
*  It's like the whole town's going crazy because a demon possession and you have to get the stuff that deep
*  Trans women are trans women. That's what they are. I don't see that as being difficult as a matter of fact
*  It's difficult and I don't think there's anything wrong with it and I
*  They're equal to all of us and we're fine. And what's the problem?
*  I got dragged into that if you know because of a mixed martial arts fighter
*  woman
*  And I was like, this is my hill. I will die on this. Oh, yeah, I mean crazy brutal
*  Yeah, the watching the fights were brutal and not skill wise either was just raw strength down
*  And if you had someone who was taking steroids for 30 years and then they got off steroids for two
*  You would absolutely think that person had a massive advantage for being on steroids all those years
*  That's right. If they were a woman, that's right, particularly a man
*  Yes as well, but particularly if you're a woman and you're on steroids for 30 years and you get off them
*  That's what being a man is. It's not just being on steroids for 30 years and then transitioning to no steroids
*  It's also having the physical structure of a man the differences in the hips the shoulders the size of the hands
*  There's a lot going on there. There's a lot going on and this is an area of my own
*  I have very few areas of expertise
*  But beating the fuck out of people is one of my areas of expertise. I'm a professional commentator
*  All right. So when I see that I mean I used to teach martial arts for a living. I understand it
*  I understand fighting more than it probably understand most things
*  You're crazy if you think there's not a difference between female and male bodies
*  I mean the data are unequivocal about that. Yeah, but it was one of those things where I like I was like
*  Okay, this is one of the rare places where I really if I go down on this one
*  Like this is not this is not you. I can't see trans women just dominating in women's MMA. It's crazy
*  No, I hear you. I do not mind
*  That they choose to fight trans women if they know in advance sure the Fallon Fox issue was
*  She had fought twice as a woman without letting anyone know that she used to be a man for 30 years
*  And I was like you're crazy
*  You can't just do that if someone wants to fight a trans woman and they're cool with it
*  Like there's a woman who fought me you have seen her name is Ashley Evan Smith and she wanted to actually beating Fallon Fox
*  Yeah, yeah, it's a minor way to the UFC, but she's just far more skillful very skillfully. Yeah, that's all that was right
*  She's a real UFC caliber fighter
*  That's why she was a like like if I had to choose between like Fallon Fox fought Amanda Nunes
*  It's like the greatest woman of all time Amanda Nunes would kill her sure yeah killer
*  But absolutely, but it doesn't mean that she's a woman
*  You know just because that just cuz Amanda Nunes man knows have probably fucked me up
*  It doesn't mean that she you know that I'm a woman
*  You know if this Fallon Fox guy gets or woman rather gets beat up by Amanda Nunes
*  I really didn't mean to misgender her there, but if she gets beat up by Amanda Nunes
*  It doesn't
*  Invalidate her as a trans woman. It doesn't just says you're not biologically a woman right and this is what sports are about
*  It's about this like this. I had a conversation with a guy on this podcast about that
*  And he's like I don't think that there's that big a difference in biological sex
*  I said okay, so you cool with men competing in women's sports as men
*  Yeah, we say he didn't know where to go. I mean that's the thing right so like if we look at psychological profiles
*  for example sometimes there are
*  You know the data are always hard to parse with things like this
*  But there are very slight differences in the two you know the male distribution and the female distribution of all the people
*  What does it look like they overlap really close and there's little variations when you look at?
*  Upper body strength, and you look at grip strength
*  There's they don't they almost don't overlap like there. There are very very top strongest women
*  Just barely cross over the weakest men in terms of grip strength and raw upper body strength
*  Yeah, that's why women you know it's such a big deal when a woman gets to where she knew like ten pull-ups or something
*  Like it's like everybody should throw a party for that. It's nothing wrong with them
*  It's nothing to do with their their effort or ability or anything. It's literally that it's a harder climb to get there
*  Except those CrossFit ladies Jesus Christ
*  I was documenting one these CrossFit ladies this one lady had her abs were like if someone took
*  Turtle shells and just shoved them under her skin. They were so thick
*  Everything about her was so thick I mean well
*  I mean you think what is CrossFit right CrossFit was like competitive exercise
*  I mean, that's like the whole point of it is like how do we turn exercise itself into a sport some of those gals?
*  Are pretty they are they're they're super strong
*  I'm friends with actually some some some rather top athletes
*  and you know men and women both that have been pretty significant in CrossFit and and in other things and
*  You can get really strong you can get really strong, but again, you can't get as strong as a man
*  That's why there's men and women's divisions even in CrossFit even though it's a great East Lee CrossFit women who are monsters
*  They can't compete with the male CrossFit athletes exactly
*  Yeah, and and and that's the thing is you're always when you're looking at competitive people as you're always in that like
*  Tail end of good at this yeah
*  You know like the people who are already really developed really good at it and as far as like trans women are trans women I
*  Feel like we should be using language in a way that increases clarity rather than decreases clarity
*  So like you said I mean it's exactly like you said there's literally nothing wrong in the world with being a trans woman nothing
*  Nothing if you want to be that trans woman. I'm happy for you. I'll respect your pronouns the whole thing
*  You know I'm with you as long as you don't make them up well
*  I'm not there's a degree
*  I mean there is a thing the way you know you're forcing somebody to try to do something she I'll say her I'll say
*  We can't make up new ones well the world's confusing enough as it is and and and so we should be trying to strive for more
*  Clarity not less so a trans woman is a trans woman and that allows for us to acknowledge
*  What's actually going on in all regards? Yeah as opposed to saying trans women are women woman is a broader category and
*  It therefore confuses a situation, and I I think that there's almost like a lot of manufactured drama
*  Not just in that issue, but in all of this where these definitions are getting
*  Blurred out so I mean that's what I do all the time now the last year
*  It's like all I've been doing is researching how they misuse words and writing and not trans people specifically, but this whole woke
*  Ideology or the social justice scholarship, and I've been writing an encyclopedia on my website about that
*  And it's just like I've been writing my own encyclopedia, and it's it's a monumental task
*  But it actually is really helping people are emailing me every day
*  And so you know I can't make sense of this until until I read your stuff. Oh wow and so it's like I have
*  I called it translations for the woke from the woke ish like going off of a
*  Tolkien he's got you know
*  He's Elvis yeah, and so I call it translations from the woke ish. It's on my website new discourses and
*  It's got like a hundred and something done now hundred something terms
*  So it's like you know they say the word folks. Why do they say folks?
*  Why do I say folks I say folks all the time well I do too
*  I'm from the south particularly that I have to right I can't get away like the way it sounds well
*  It's good, but these folks are crazy
*  Yeah, but they say white folks black folks queer folks
*  Lesbian folks and it's like there's this identity folks right and so I want the purpose of the encyclopedia was to dig into this
*  Terminology and make it clear again more clarity not less
*  So the people can understand where it's coming from so the reason they say folks is the same reason the Germans have folks in the
*  1930s
*  As it turns out it's it's an idea of a group culture. Okay, so it's the idea of moving a
*  Culture into you know it's identifying a group of people and saying that it has that they are a folk that they have a culture
*  And of course we're most familiar with that
*  You know as they say in the original German because it somebody picked it up and yelled it a lot
*  There's also this issue that if a culture has been maligned right if they are marginalized like trans people
*  Yep, then people who are not trans people are automatically thought of as in some way
*  Negative or bigoted or right you if you're a straight white male for instance right like you're all
*  Automatically a piece of shit. That's right
*  That's what this is doing woke Olympics
*  I don't think like we said earlier like a lot of the guys taking notes at church
*  They know that yeah, but everybody below that doesn't really get it
*  They think this is just about helping people and running fair
*  That's what we would like right and this actually comes from a place like that's kind of what this book is about is that I've
*  Traced that for like it goes back to actually I don't I don't want to mislead people and say oh
*  This is Marxism. You know you have to whisper Marxism
*  But it is Marx who took the idea and he cooked up this idea called conflict theory
*  He actually took it from other German philosophers and made this you can't even say what he changed
*  He changed Hegel's idea of what's called you can't even say this anymore the master-slave dialectic because those master and slave have traces
*  That you know, even though that's what it was called. You can't talk about it. So
*  Marx took the idea of the master-slave dialectic, which was that people who have Hegel wrote that people have power
*  Wrote that people have power
*  And then there are people who don't have power the person that's being oppressed by the power understands the oppression
*  Whereas the person who's doing the oppression can't write simple enough Marx cooked this up into this idea called conflict theory
*  It says oh different groups in society and he mostly meant rich people versus poor people
*  Have are in are completely separate from one another and there's no idea that they help each other like that
*  Like amazon.com and making a super successful business that makes it easier to move products and to you know
*  Generates more income for the site. There's no positive some story according to Marx. It's all conflict
*  and so what Marx's idea was is that the
*  oppressor class is always the enemy of
*  The underclass and this has actually traced down through history
*  It was economics then and then this this
*  Philosophical school started in in Germany at first moved to Columbia University during the World War two
*  It's called the the Frankfurt School of critical theory and they moved it into ideology and culture and it's a dominant culture
*  Whoever, you know has the most status and power the elites which at the time was Jen genuinely like white straight men for the most part
*  Those people basically brainwash the underclass into not realizing that they should rise up against so you have this whole dynamic of conflict
*  Where the oppressor class doesn't realize what it's like to be oppressed the oppressed class constantly can't get away from it
*  That's where you see this phrase now people are being killed in the street every day, which isn't even true
*  but it doesn't matter because it's a matter of feeling and then
*  the underclass always has to be at war to try to
*  Overturn the power above them which is called hegemony
*  Which comes from this guy and tell me Antonio Gramsci who is a Italian philosopher who came up with a long march through the institutions
*  Which I think we're now seeing for sure happening like take over the institutions from within with this stuff
*  So this stuff all has like I mean we don't have to be dorks
*  But I mean I can do that on my own but this is a very long history
*  This isn't like it didn't just pop up in 2014 when when Michael Brown got shot
*  Do you think when things happen like the George Floyd murder that it just it opens up a door and this stuff comes through
*  And then the vibration changes like it moves to a higher frequency because it's more common. That's right. That's right
*  And I mean there's a lot going on here, too, right? So
*  The George Floyd cases is actually fairly straightforward because I mean eight minutes and 46 seconds is fucked up
*  There's nothing else to say about it I
*  20 seconds is fucked up. I know
*  Especially if you've got the guys three guys and you yeah, how hard is it to put cuffs on?
*  George Floyd was a big fella. He's a big strong fella, but there's no reason not just put a knee on the man's back
*  Exactly, and then how long do cuffs take?
*  Right, so guys cuffed you you just you get him in the fucking car
*  Yeah, let him do what he's gonna do in the back of the car
*  I guess they had some sort of animosity personal animosity
*  Which you know, I would wonder if that would move it to first-degree murder I have no idea but but
*  What we have now is this culture where video goes viral, right?
*  And this is a striking thing. So it's really more prominent in I mean, it's pretty clear
*  You can see the video with George Floyd, but if you back up to Michael Brown, it's more complicated in Ferguson
*  Because you know the short video that went viral in the first place was you know a few not very many seconds clip of
*  This black guy getting shot by an armed black guy getting shot by a cop
*  But it doesn't tell the preceding story which has now come to light that involved
*  You know him trying to take the cops gun and like wrestling with him and charging at him
*  So the more complicated story is that true though. Do we know that for a fact?
*  I'm not I'm scared of that narrative because you know, I don't but I'd heard that narrative
*  But I'm like I would hate to get behind that sure sure sure and that's actually my point. That's actually my point
*  So I was sent a video I'm gonna skip tracks to a different video because I want to make a point that we live in a
*  We live in a mediated world now, right a mediated epistemology is what I would call it then the media itself
*  social media so all of us participating are
*  Able to spin narratives around like a 30 second video
*  So the other day this guy sends me a video on Twitter and I watch it and it's some black guy
*  With a microphone and you know, like in a radio studio and he's like going he's like, you know
*  These white people ain't gonna take it no more. They ain't gonna take it. He's like yelling
*  He's like they're gonna rise up, you know, and it's it's obvious what you're watching. You're like man. This guy's like
*  These riots are out of control
*  And so I wanted to share it but it was sent to me on Twitter and I couldn't figure out how so I looked it
*  Up on YouTube and so I had like a 40 second clip sent to me and I'm like, you know
*  What about this riots and I wanted to show it to somebody and so I go and I find it on YouTube and I watch
*  It and it's the same thing in 40 seconds and it ends
*  But the video that I watched is several minutes and then the next thing the guy says is this president is divisive
*  This president is the problem. It's so divisive. He's causing all the division and it's like, holy shit
*  He's actually talking about Trump and then I kept watching and he's like President Obama
*  It's got to go at the end
*  And so it depends on which part of that clip you see the story changes completely
*  I watched the 40 seconds and I was like, holy shit. This is the riots and then oh my god
*  It's about Trump and then boom now it's this dude railing about Obama several years ago and the video
*  Was sent to me because it was going crazy with the implication that it was about the riots, but it was about Obama
*  That's crazy. So this is like the deal right? We you what we're seeing isn't always the whole story
*  And there's live in this clip culture now, which is a real problem, right?
*  And we piece together the story we believe based on you know
*  Prior assumptions about it like the Covington case exactly where that kid was just standing there and the Native American guy came up to him
*  With the drum. That's right
*  And he was smiling the Native Americans face and they got a photo of it and it really looks like this kid's a prick and then
*  He's taunting these Native Americans. We're just peacefully
*  Banging on their drums. That's exactly right
*  So we live in this situation now where the I don't want to say the media like it's this entity because actually in a sense
*  We are all participating these clips, you know that people loading up on Twitter
*  That whole context isn't there and
*  You said, you know, does it just jack everything up to a higher frequency and absolutely it does because everybody can take that clip and then
*  Just upload their story of what they want to have to be true into that clip and it becomes like it's like in
*  I mean, we're already talking about religion. It's like a miracle like, you know back in 2000 3000 years ago
*  You know some something weird happened and then you know people one person tells another and another print another and it's like
*  And I swear, you know an angel came down from the sky and touched him and he was healed and he could walk again
*  You know, it's so it's like a miracle story
*  But mediated through partially informative video
*  It's almost like you know, everybody's scared that deep fake is coming where they can basically put your face on whatever porn star
*  Saying some horrible thing that you never said or whatever
*  It's it's it is the precursor to that
*  Because you can cut that clip just right and then all of a sudden it means one thing if you cut it just another
*  Way, it means something exactly the opposite or totally different and different groups that want to push a narrative which is like everybody
*  Latches on to it and runs with it and this of course causes crazy polarization. Yeah, right
*  So that same clip I saw I don't know that it would be a good example
*  But you know you could take it as the riots and you know that get one that black guy's sick of the riots
*  And so the right wing's all over it like look at this guy, you know
*  And then boom this president so divisive and now it's the left story and you cut it right there and the next thing
*  You know, it's President Obama, you know, and all of a sudden it's which side it switches sides again
*  And it's also and it's also history. Yeah, and then even the thing I watched it was longer was four and a half minutes
*  And then the whole thing is like an hour
*  So what really what was really the whole got the pull the right whole point and so
*  We're getting away from being able to understand because you know, our attention spans are so short you live in Twitter
*  It's like you have the attention span of like a goldfish man. You can't pay attention to anything
*  We're marinating in dopamine all the time brain doesn't work, right?
*  So you don't have time to like parse anything together. You see this thing you're pissed off and retweet, you know snarky comment
*  Don't you think that also just the the format of Twitter?
*  Itself is just I think it's detrimental to people's mental health big time
*  communicating through these small little
*  Sentences and trying and little paragraphs of 280 words. That's right characters. Yeah
*  So it's like 30. Yeah. Yeah, and so
*  This I actually called Twitter a deconstruction machine, which is straight out of this again the same critical
*  Postmodern philosophy stuff that I kind of keep circling around
*  Deconstruction is the idea that it's the same thing as the media mediated ideas that we're gonna take a thing apart
*  make it look absurd or we're gonna show show it in a particular light and then
*  You know pull it apart into it until you don't really trust its validity anymore
*  And that's it specifically its purpose is to make it so that you don't trust the validity of the thing anymore
*  And so anything you put on Twitter once you get an account of a certain size at least
*  Anything like I have an account that's big enough now. So I experience this regularly
*  It's a 100% chance that some jackass is gonna say something that just messes with your head
*  right and or somebody's gonna take it out of context or they're gonna tell you what they thought you mean and now that's the
*  Thing you mean or they're gonna screenshot it and it's gonna go around and they're gonna like it's like I
*  Mean you're famous enough where it's obviously happens to you all the time
*  I'm sure it's like they take something that you say
*  You know the podcast or you put on Twitter or your shows or whatever and they clip it up and then there's like you know
*  Who Joe Rogan is but then there's like this new Joe Rogan that they created that's out in the universe, right?
*  So they take you apart
*  They deconstruct you
*  They're the real Joe Rogan and your real intentions and your real meaning and then they put it out into the world and there's this new
*  Joe Rogan that does horrible thing or the new Joe Rogan maybe that's a saint
*  Well, I always tell people to like if you have an issue with some of the things that I say guess what?
*  I have an issue with some of the things I say if you were here with me when I say things and you disagreed
*  I'd listen to your point. I'm not an idealist or an ideologue. Yeah, when it comes to
*  Ideas and that comes to concepts. I'm not married to anything that I say, right?
*  So we need to be able to talk about it, right?
*  So you say a thing and then I'm like, but I think part of the problem is they can't talk about no
*  They have to tweet about it
*  So because they're not in the room and they don't have your attention, right?
*  So then they get angry and that's part of the problem with podcasts as well as like right right now
*  You and I are having a conversation. Yeah, but millions of people are listening to this conversation
*  There's a lot of them that wish they could chime in and they don't get to that's what they do is they get angry and they
*  Put some stuff on Twitter. I understand the motivation
*  I understand the thought process behind it. I really do but I personally can't engage
*  Because it's just too unhealthy right exactly. So yeah, I think social media is in Twitter in particular
*  Among social media. I don't know. I don't interact on Facebook anymore. So I don't really I don't use Facebook
*  Oh, it's a mess. I use it just posts from my Instagram to Facebook, but I don't look at it at all
*  Yeah, yeah, it's just too weird. It's weird. It's through Zuckerberg as many creeps. Yeah, I mean, I don't like the way drinks water
*  I haven't even seen I don't want to know this all I know is that when Zuckerberg sits down and he opens his laptop
*  He sees got his little camera covered up and I'm like, what's up with this? He knows something
*  Yeah, he knows he's got a fucking strap on and a dress. Yeah. No all kinds of weird shit
*  So yeah, I don't I don't I don't do that. But I Twitter Twitter choose your mind up man. It's made to be bad
*  It's me. It's it's really a bad place
*  And I really feel bad because I feel like I've kind of like uploaded myself into the matrix of Twitter
*  You're honored every day though. I go to your page. So you're arguing with
*  Sometimes it's funny. Sometimes it's bad. Are you do you get uncomfortable with it?
*  Like is it no things were I did in the past so you're getting better at being hard
*  Yeah, I mean you have to you have to harden up you have to realize that it actually doesn't matter
*  that you know
*  It's kind of like I made the analogy actually a while back that it's like doing I mean, I've never done a stage show
*  So don't I've given talks, but I haven't done like a stage show, but you get a heckler in the audience
*  but really you have like
*  70,000 of them and when when you're doing the show, you know as a comedian you either interact with the heckler a little bit
*  You try to flip it on him or whatever or you
*  You know try to ignore it as long as it's like not too obtrusive and you kind of have to have that same
*  Mindset you have to think of Twitter as being on stage, right and that the audience though
*  Like when you do a real show the audience isn't supposed to yell at you all the time, right?
*  But on Twitter everything you say they're gonna yell at you. So you have to just like tune it out
*  I've actually found in the past several been trying to figure it out over the last couple of years
*  I found that if I look at my feed that I've you know
*  I follow these people and I look at what they tweet
*  Whatever and if I look at my direct messages that people send me whatever
*  But if I look at people replying to me and whether I got likes or retweets if I pay any attention to that
*  It drives me nuts. So when I stop paying attention to that, like I only look at it at a like, you know
*  All right. I got half an hour
*  I'm gonna dick around with it and just have a good time or whatever fine because it's in a controlled dose
*  but if you get hooked into that man you get pulled into the cycle and it's like
*  It's bad. Well, there's a lot of people that are doing it too
*  Like I know people that are mentally unwell that are on Twitter 12 hours a day
*  Mm-hmm, and they're just constantly arguing with people and I could just imagine them nervous and sweating and freaking out
*  Yeah, at replies and seeing if it's going their way. Yeah
*  People are piling onto them and they freak out, you know
*  I think this is actually a big part of how the woke thing mainstreamed
*  Was the internet at first you got to think when the internet first came out, you know
*  The kids aren't old enough to even know this but you know, we know this when the internet first came out
*  Who was on the internet all the time? Who were the first two online people shut-ins?
*  Yeah, people who were socially awkward who if they went out with their friends
*  It didn't really work out great. A lot of times they said awkward stuff. It got shut down
*  It wasn't fun for them. So it gave them a social outlet where
*  Where that you know, they could fit in and I think that this actually has contributed like internet social media culture is so
*  strongly built by people a who are that way now and
*  Be by people who are that way when these things were getting set up that it's all kind of built around
*  You know, maybe people with personality disorders people are just socially awkward people who?
*  Don't want to interact with human beings in the normal way
*  It's just the whole structure of it though, even if you're a normally like a personable human
*  Yeah
*  when you're typing things out and just sending it out there and you know, you've got an egg for an avatar and
*  Someone reads it. You're completely anonymous and it's just a bizarre way to interact. It's so weird
*  It's so it's unnatural and like how quick you'll just get rid of people
*  Mm-hmm, like that guy said that guy and I have been interacting for like two years, you know here and there
*  I don't really know him. He's some dude and then he made one comment. I'm like gone, you know
*  That's it to cut out of my life
*  Think of the like that's gonna translate, you know
*  You get in the habit where somebody pisses you off and you just cut them out of your life because on Twitter
*  That's what you would do. Yeah, you block Facebook. You like you unfriend somebody or whatever
*  Yeah, and like I actually have felt that impulse in real life
*  Like, you know, I'm hanging out with somebody and he says some dick-headed comment and I'm just like yeah
*  Where's my block button? How do I remove this person from my life? Like right now?
*  There's no room for nuance and there's no room for
*  There's no room for like you said earlier for growth for someone to
*  Learn live and learn and get better at it
*  And that's what galls me about this woke stuff because they're like this is about healing and it's like it's not it's like the it's
*  Like the least healing thing I've ever heard. It's like make everybody walk on eggshells think they're gonna get cancelled get you know
*  Hot takes dropped on it. That's another thing with social media to rise hot takes
*  What's gonna go viral is like that dude totally dunking on that other dude, right? It's not the nuanced analysis
*  It's not the guy who knows what he's talking about or is thoughtful
*  He's just getting tore up in his mentions and freaking out and sweating about it. Yeah, it's it's fast food information
*  But hot takes are critical theory. Mmm hot takes a critical theory as a comic
*  You'll get it cuz like there's that there are different kinds of comedy, right?
*  There's like narrative comedy and you're telling a story and it's a funny story and it works
*  But then you have the kind of and you can do this good and bad, right?
*  there's a good way in a bad way, but you can get on stage and you can be that guy who just kind of
*  Like you're trying to blow people's mind, but you're just kind of like criticizing something
*  Mm-hmm. I don't want to put down Jerry Seinfeld because I think he's brilliant
*  He's one of my favorites of all time
*  But you know, what's the deal with you know something he just says something kind of stupid afterwards or you know
*  Gallagher was big with that with like the stupid words, you know, it's like how now
*  Bo you know English is stupid, you know that that's actually critical theory. You don't actually have to know what
*  Made the thing work, but you can just tell this kind of like dunking joke on it
*  That kind of gets yucks or whatever and then in comedy fine, you know, we know a good comic from a bad comic
*  We laugh. That's the point is to make something funny and everybody bombs
*  but when you start doing that with like people's lives and social philosophy and calling them calling them things like racist and sexist that can
*  Can ruin their lives and it's a totally different ballgame
*  Right. So it's like looking for that place to just be critical because it becomes a problem
*  don't you think it's also just because it can be done like if you gave people a
*  keyboard and if you told them look every time you press that Q button a rocket's gonna fly out of the sky and
*  Slam into a part of the planet. Yeah. Yeah people would hit that button
*  Oh, man, there would be people like it's new and they don't even have to be there when it hits
*  Yeah, you're essentially like if you say something mean to someone online and it really gets them
*  Yeah, especially if you're anonymous you're sending an emotional bomb their way
*  Exactly. And I mean I know a lot of 15 year old guys because I hung out with several of them and times
*  I probably was one who would basically have like two little like like xylophone hammers
*  Yeah, the whole time oh my god, they go horrible when I was 15
*  Yeah
*  I don't know what I would do and that's one of the things that I try to tell people when they're interacting with folks on Twitter
*  And getting heated I'm like that could be a 15 year old kid laughing his ass off that he got you to respond to him
*  Yeah, and the bigger you are the funnier it is. Yes. Yeah, and like yeah
*  It's it's just absolutely not a good place. It's such not a good place, but there's some good to it, right?
*  First of all, if you follow a lot of people you can get a lot of interesting information
*  Fast-breaking news. I swear it knows the news before it happens. Well, I got all my news about Chaz
*  Is it Chaz or is it chopped down? Well, it's over now is what it is. I just saw that this morning
*  Yeah, apparently they the cops went in and it took an hour and it was over and they cleaned it up
*  Well, they're cleaning it up. I mean, it's a wreck but
*  It was Chaz and it became chopped. So Capitol Hill
*  Autonomous zone is Chaz and then chop they I think they derived directly from the French Revolution like they're gonna get guillotines like these badasses
*  They're gonna get guillotines. Well, they put a guillotine outside of Jeff Bezos's house. I saw that. What did he do?
*  I don't know then make a lot of money probably. Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean, he's not a bad guy is he I don't know I mean he's not known as a bad guy
*  I don't like he's not doing terrible things. Is he I don't think he is he's not paying people enough or something
*  Covid hit he gave everybody a $2 an hour raise like across the board like right away. Did he? Yeah
*  Well, why they why they have a guillotine outside his house just because he represents capitalism. Yeah, probably. Yeah, they don't like capitalism. Yeah
*  Which sucks again, that's that critical thing. Like yeah, there's this there's okay
*  So there's a difference between building a thing and tearing a thing down. It's easy to tear it
*  I read a poem about this maybe like a lot of people did I think when we were in school
*  I don't know maybe even you read it. I can't recall I quote it
*  There's this poem talking about as the builder or something and it's like or that maybe is the demo guy
*  but it's like this poem about how easy it is to just knock the bricks down and knock the building down and it's like
*  This took builders like six months to build and it took me a day to knock it down or whatever
*  it's easy to tear things down and
*  It's easy to do like this kind of hot take complaining thing to tear people down or tear ideas down
*  But it's hard to understand a thing and it's hard to build a thing
*  Yeah, right. And so that's kind of how we ended up here in the long run
*  Again, I go back to that Frankfurt school to kind of root this in deep philosophy and history
*  They they came up with this idea critical theory that we've talked about now and they had this other idea traditional theory
*  And they said just use them together
*  critical theory was how you complain that things aren't Marxist enough more or less and then
*  That's people bomb me for saying that but it is actually general generally true
*  Traditional theory was understanding things its philosophy at science
*  It's figuring out how to you know make airplanes work and figure out how to get the the air traffic control
*  So they don't crash into each other the whole complicated mess and one of these things you're supposed to use them together
*  But one of these things is a lot easier
*  Right. So what happens when you start kind of getting a lot of half-assed PhDs in the academic world who need something to do
*  You think they're gonna do the hard thing versus the easy thing?
*  Everybody who did I mean I majored in math
*  Everybody who did I mean I majored in math. I'm gonna be my little elitist
*  You know dorky thing here
*  Everybody who majored in something hard watched people bounce off of their hard major into the easier majors and like so they could still just get a
*  degree
*  So you start like they call this overproduction a cultural overproduction or cultural elite overproduction
*  you start putting too many people into degree programs that
*  that
*  They're not you know, they're not gonna graduate with an engineering degree
*  It's freaking hard and so what they end up doing is they get these degrees and things that are easy
*  Well complaining is easy tearing down is easy building up is hard. So there's this bias that's happened over the last hundred years in academia
*  Toward this easier thing criticism and away from the harder thing, which is understanding and developing, you know
*  fundamental research and so on and
*  It's basically taken over academia now
*  And that's how we I think that's actually a lot of how we got here
*  Is it the easy thing is the easy thing and complaining is cheap is there pushback against that idea
*  Which part about whether or not these people initially started in difficult studies and then move their way into like
*  These so yeah, so it's off social. It's sort of really I mean, well that just happens
*  I mean my my best friend in college was you know, he was gonna be a mechanical engineer and then calculus just took care of that
*  He was not going to be a mechanical engineer anymore because he couldn't pass calculus
*  So that I mean, but he did graduate college with another degree. So there is this kind of chopping down to easier degrees, right?
*  But as far as like this anti-intellectualism trend that I was describing this actually did
*  It was recognized along the way. So this is one of the guys in the Frankfurt schools name was Herbert Marcuse
*  This is the guy who laid out the idea of repressive tolerance that you have to violently fight against ideas that might
*  Cause intolerance to rise up. He did that in 1965 what happened in 1967 in 1968, you know riots
*  Following his ideas exactly and so Marcuse was on TV in like 77 right before he died
*  He died
*  I think in the early 80s or late 70s and he complained about his own movement that he started that had got completely
*  Anti-intellectual they weren't doing the hard work. They weren't doing the right stuff
*  They were just doing the easy stuff and he actually complained on TV that this had happened
*  That there'd been a sliding away from the serious work and toward the easier complaining stuff. And so yeah, I think that it's it's historically
*  Justifiable that that's exactly what happened. Of course, you know, I was here before and we talked about those fake papers that yeah
*  Peter and Helen and I let's tell everybody what those are just because it's an amazing source of enjoyment and entertainment
*  For folks that are looking for something to read right so so we don't lose the point real quick
*  We did in less than like 10 months the almost equivalent of a whole academic career in this stuff and we're amateurs
*  So it's easy as a joke as a joke passed off as real and then actually applauded. That's right. So we wrote
*  20 fake academic papers in these exact fields critical race theory
*  Peter Boghossian did it with you and Helen
*  It's pluck Rose pluck Rose, yeah most thing the second most English name wrote
*  cynical theories with you, yeah, so
*  Yeah, that's a very English name. It is a very English name. So we we wrote these papers to try to show that this
*  Scholarship is bogus. Right? And so we spent just under a year writing crazy stuff
*  Please tell people the dog park one. You love them
*  So the dog park store dog park paper was actually I think kind of the masterpiece of the thing
*  So we we wrote this paper
*  Where we claim that we were a feminist researcher who spent a thousand hours in
*  Portland Oregon dog parks over the course of one year
*  Never in the heavy rain. We put that in the paper never in the heavy rain like that's some relevant detail or something
*  So a thousand hours over a year is already ridiculous. That's like six hours a day
*  every day
*  I know and what what we said she did was she she watched dog humping incidents and
*  Tried to determine when they counted as dog rapes and when they didn't and the name of the paper though
*  oh, it was a was it
*  queer performativity and
*  Well, how's it go because they had all the buzzwords, right? Yeah hetero normative was in there. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, sorry
*  I'm
*  queer performativity and urban dog parks and in
*  Portland, Oregon rape culture and queer performative. That's what I was right culture. Yeah, so
*  so we had that we
*  said that she she watched these dog fights and dog rapes and all this stuff and we put this crazy stuff in there like
*  Sometimes they try to break up a dog fight by doing jumping jacks by the dog or singing songs and just ridiculous and the dogs were
*  Pooping on each other we put that in the paper and then we said when there was a dog humping
*  That she would go up and she would inspect the dogs genitals and she inspected
*  10,000 dogs genitals and then interrogated the owners about their sexual orientations
*  What she wanted to find out was if straight men would discourage gay dog humping
*  versus straight dog humping and it was different for women and gay men and
*  Then the we said we're gonna pass that data through black feminist criminology
*  And then that that we said that the conclusion was that dog parks are
*  Petri dishes of canine rape culture and that they are rape condoning spaces just like human nightclubs
*  So human nightclubs are automatically now rape condoning spaces
*  And so the conclusion was that we now have to train men
*  the way that we train dogs with like leashes and shot collars and things in order to
*  In order to get rape culture to go away and they give this an award
*  And so it's like this the bullshit level is just insane
*  So they had a thing it was their anniversary. The journal is the number one feminist geography journal in the world and
*  There was a 25th anniversary edition of the journal gender place and culture
*  and
*  It's it's the leading feminist geography journal in the world and they had their 25th year
*  So they're on their 25th anniversary. And so what they wanted to do was highlight one paper per issue the entire year
*  As being exemplary scholarship in feminist geography and ours was chosen. I
*  Can tell you men it was the craziest thing ever. I remember I'm almost positive was May 7th 2018
*  I got the email and it's like I can remember it's just like go in the house
*  I was out doing like yard work or something and I come in and I checked my email and I just remember like
*  Gaping at the screen. I'm like this can't be this can't be happening because I thought I just saw the editor and I'm like
*  Oh, no, they figured it out. Right and it's we're gonna give it an award
*  And so I end up I grab because because we're making a documentary about it. Right? So we got a filmmaker Mike Naina
*  He's the one that did that three-part documentary of evergreen that showed everybody how I mean
*  That's what where everybody's evergreen now
*  And so Mike it was like anything that happens film it so I grabbed my GoPro and I have this footage and it's like
*  Sideways because I didn't even like think about it. I'm just like running outside trying to find my wife
*  I'm like you aren't gonna believe this you aren't gonna believe this. Oh my gosh, you know
*  There's a really freaking crazy, you know, like it's almost like
*  It's almost like the world slid off of its foundation a little bit when they get that paper and award for me
*  It was just so weird. Well, you nailed it. We didn't really nailed it. You cut you came so close
*  To reality but yet still lived in the world of parody
*  That's right
*  But you said all the things that you need is it just shows that there's such a high tolerance for bullshit
*  That's right in those air quotes disciplines, right in those air quotes disciplines are now being like mainlined into like every university every school
*  Every corporate boardroom. How did that happen?
*  I mean we were talking about, you know, the raising the frequency thing when these events happen
*  But mostly it's they took over our colleges of education about
*  1980 and so they've been slowly turning teachers to the project and
*  Then in 2002 and three there were a couple of Supreme Court cases that that were talking about affirmative action
*  And they said that if you want to do affirmative action, you can do it if it increases diversity and equity and inclusion
*  So they started to build these offices in the university and those university offices started to like dictate what you could and couldn't say
*  You could get in trouble or brought up to hearings
*  even if you don't even if the hearing finds you innocent you still had to waste your time going through this humiliating hearing and
*  They're bringing up stuff and all your you know
*  How do you imagine you're like in a department right and you get hauled before the diversity office?
*  What are all your colleagues thinking about you now?
*  Like what did he do right? Right? So all of a sudden it starts just pushing everybody to not criticize this stuff
*  Mm-hmm, right and it's all censorship exactly out of fear
*  Silencing people getting them to silence themselves actually and so then they take that that
*  Lack of criticism and then they can just go crazy with their stuff
*  It's like critical race theory specifically people email me all the time and they say
*  Where are the scholarly criticisms of critical race theory and I actually write back
*  You're not allowed to do that like the most recent ones in law journals like substantive ones are from the 1990s
*  So there's nobody criticizing this stuff. Oh, wow. So when you aren't criticizing it
*  I mean scholarship depends on people shooting down your bad ideas
*  You know in South Park talks about them smelling their own farts or whatever smelling each other's farts. It literally it's like it's that
*  That's what's happening. Yeah, nobody's ever telling them that they're wrong
*  Nobody's ever allowed to and you can't criticize it
*  Why because if you criticize critical race there, you must be a racist now
*  What was the response to you guys getting an award for that once you revealed that this was all horseshit?
*  Oh, she wasn't happy the editor of that journal was not happy. She felt like betrayed like, you know
*  Well, she was she was she was but she felt you know, like I had been so nice
*  I was so kind to her and she was very kind to me
*  I have to be she was a very nice person most of these people that's a very important
*  But these aren't mostly nice people there are some hustlers and they take advantage of that situation
*  Yeah, because that's what this is really wide open to so she was a nice person
*  But she's living in that world and she thought that all that stuff made sense. Yeah. Yeah
*  She I mean, that's the thing is they think this stuff's all real like yeah
*  it's it's like they've kind of gone into this mass delusion where where
*  Everything's power dynamics and the power dynamics define how everybody experiences life and do you remember when Jordan Peterson was on television?
*  On the CBC and he was talking to some professor
*  I think may or may not have been transgender who was saying that there is no such thing as biological sex and I can unpack
*  For you. Yeah, if you'd like and then keeps going as if it's just like you made a statement that there's no such things
*  Biological sex right? Yeah, that's I mean that's got a pedigree in academic literature going back to actually at least their early
*  1990s an argument with a professor about it on this show is like it's not there's no different
*  I goes there's no difference between males and females. I go so if you buy a male puppy and they give you a female
*  Do you complain?
*  What happens that it was he he didn't know what to say
*  He was just he you could tell when he was saying the things he was saying that he was
*  Knowing that he was going to get support from the people that he works with exactly
*  It's this this thing that you do where you've indoctrinated yourself into this world or you've been indoctrinated and now you have to sort of
*  keep up
*  That nonsense do you hit it exactly then earlier?
*  Because I don't know if you've ever like let the Jehovah's Witness in like and talk to them
*  But if you get them to really have to go off script
*  Sometimes it'd be like two of them they're like look at each other and they can mumble from it
*  We'll have to go back and consult about that and we'll come back and talk to you later
*  It's like if they don't if they're not on the script, they don't know what to do
*  So you catch him in this thing and that's actually the thing is it's crazy. This stuff's taken over right now
*  Mostly it's not because they're just calling people racist and everybody's good intentions are being played upon but
*  If you give it the slightest pushback, they don't know what to do
*  Yeah, because in their world you can say there's no such thing as biological sex, right?
*  Yeah, I have a friend who works at a very large newspaper and
*  They said they can't say that there are two genders
*  Like if you say there are two genders, you will literally get thrown out of the office
*  And they're like we're not exaggerating that I mean, yeah imagine that I have a friend that works in journalism
*  Who's gay and has a gay sensitivity reader to make sure that?
*  his
*  Writing is gay sensitive enough. He's gay
*  He's gay and he has a gay sensitivity reader to make sure his writing is gay enough
*  Can he just check with himself? You would think so. Yeah, I would imagine you would think so Douglas Murray
*  put it put something up on his Twitter because someone's describing a gay person as a
*  cis gendered non
*  Heteronormative like something really crazy and he said I think there's another word for that, right?
*  It's case a gay person. Yeah, that's right
*  Like this like super complicated
*  Nonsense expression right just meant gay a gay person. That's where like again, there's a good comedy and bad comedy
*  That's where George Carlin had that awesome
*  Classic bit where he talked about adding syllables and hyphens, you know, it's like World War one
*  It was shell shock and now it's post traumatic stress disorder eight syllables one hyphen, you know, he's counting them. Yeah, so it's like
*  There's this weird language thing happening there with all these like
*  Like he called it desensitizing or sterilizing language and that's what's happening. So it takes all that meaning away, right?
*  Yeah, nobody knows what it means except for the guy preaching it. So the guy doing the diversity training
*  I watched a diversity training somebody sent me from their job the other day and this woman's like just droning on it felt like you're
*  Just getting you know, you imagine you're at the job like you have to do this for work
*  You don't want to do it and they're just watching this webinar and this lady's just ramrodding like 12 syllable words that you she's like
*  Okay, so we have to talk about microaggressions and there are different kinds of microaggressions or a micro assaults
*  There are Mike and it's just like what the hell is this micro assaults micro insults and then Mike
*  What's a micro assault a micro assault is when you don't you do it on purpose?
*  Like but what is a micro assault?
*  so a
*  micro assault would be
*  You know making a a small but you know racially
*  Salient comment in the presence of a person of that race. Oh, so it's not even not necessarily racist
*  No, it's not an assault. No, these people violence is all words and discursive
*  So a micro assault can just be an insult and they're all insults micro
*  Everything has to just be like words or standing in the wrong place. Oh boy, Jamie just pulled it up here a micro assault is an explicit racial
*  Derogations
*  Derogations
*  Characterized what is that? How look at that expression a micro assault is an explicit racial
*  Derogations, so you've put somebody down on purpose. I know but that's a weird way of describing an explicit racial derogations
*  Plural. Oh, yeah, and who wrote that singular? Yeah, that's not right. Yeah, they're an editor derogations plural
*  Characterized primarily by verbal or nonverbal attack meant to hurt the intended victim through name-calling. There's your hyphen
*  avoidant behavior or
*  purposeful
*  discriminatory
*  Dot actions the other camera on that's broken all the pieces. It's a mess and that's a kzoo.edu
*  reason dot kzoo.edu nice
*  Even bother like editing that motherfucker
*  There's so many of these things that are like for education that are like this and it's like they say stuff like that
*  Themself and it's just like
*  This is supposed to be for education. It's barely literate. What is going on?
*  Well, that's a problem when you're using they and them as well, right? Yeah using they and them pronouns
*  Which are really supposed to I mean for the most part indicate multiple people. Yeah, right. Yeah, right
*  Yeah, I mean you say they you know, so this guy
*  What you could say they thought or they thought they would get away with it. I
*  Mean you could say it you could say right but it's hard to use it that way all the time, right?
*  It's hard to use it intentionally actually it's it's it comes up naturally sometimes and then that's fine
*  But it's hard to use intentionally. Yeah, if a person wanted to go to the store, they could go right
*  And so there's something like kind of totalitarian about making people do things like that that are difficult like jumping through these little hoops
*  And then holding them to massive account. Yes, and it's like I mean even like the Black Lives Matter thing like Black Lives Matter is a sentence
*  Obvious forcing somebody to say an obvious thing
*  That's a great name because you can't argue with it. You also can't argue. Yeah
*  Yeah, because what is a matter and of course it's I mean, it's so complicated because it's like if somebody asked me they said
*  Okay, do you support Black Lives Matter James? Do you support Black Lives Matter?
*  And of course, they're gonna try to catch me on this and it's like which one there's at least five
*  I support one of them and I think the other four are nuts
*  Right. So there's Black Lives Matter all lowercase letters is a sentence
*  You can't disagree with it because it's obvious that black lives actually matter and you shouldn't be forced to say obvious things
*  But what that what is that? That's a that's a call right? They're saying hey look
*  white people
*  People of other races we have a different experience of the society and it's bad
*  Yeah
*  And we need you to hear us and we want you to care and we want there to be action taken that we can work on
*  Together to figure out and who couldn't support that movement. I think everybody in the world supports that movement
*  But then you have the the official one and their websites full of like literally neo-marxist stuff and they're like weird like queer
*  Feminist something or another like seriously, it's all on their about page on the black lives on our website
*  And it's like there's a lot of baggage man
*  I don't know if I'm for that and then you have like the training video comes out with one saying, you know
*  We're trained Marxists and they're they're they are they're trained activists
*  You don't actually have to go along with all of that to agree with the sentence, right?
*  Then you have this thing with with white people
*  There's like a Black Lives Matter movement
*  That's white people that are like washing black people's feet and like calling them and apologizing and like freaking them out
*  And I mean, this is actually horrible, too
*  Oh, it's amazing
*  Could you imagine what it's like being like somebody calls you like all your all your white friends start calling you and they're like
*  By the way, I've always kind of been racist like you had a relationship with that person and now it's so awkward
*  My favorite one was the white actors that all got together in that black and white film. No kidding
*  That was so oh my god
*  No, and it was ones in there that I really enjoyed
*  I really know work the problem is these motherfuckers haven't worked in months and they want attention
*  That's right. They wanted attention and they weren't getting it
*  So like I know I know how to really juice this up in my favorite me me me me me. It's so dumb
*  It's so dumb Aaron Paul. He broke my heart. Oh
*  So I'm in there. Yeah, I mean through the Breaking Bad guy. Yeah, he's a mate
*  I love that dude. And then I was like, bro
*  I wish I would have talked to you before that. I know I can tell you how this goes
*  I can tell you what happens next
*  Guys like me are gonna watch it. That's right. We tell you we're gonna make fun of it a lot a lot. That's right
*  The fuck it was so funny. So then there's two more. We'll just drop them is whatever these
*  So like what happened? I wanted to get back to this you don't mind
*  When that piece came out and you got the award and then they found out
*  Yeah, like what was you said that she was pissed off?
*  It was like at this email from her that was like short
*  But it was like I don't really hurt that you were deceptive to me, you know, it's kind of like that
*  I felt bad actually like I don't I'm not I didn't do it to like be mean to people
*  Right you did it to prove a point like I actually you know
*  The saying you know, you play the ball don't play the man. Right? Yes
*  So I guess I said it backwards if it's a saying it's don't play the man play the ball
*  This was about ideas for me. Like that project was about the ideas. It was about the scholarship
*  It wasn't about the people and I felt like it was really unfortunate that
*  There were people implicated in it. I actually did feel bad for them in almost every case
*  There were a couple of them that actually right pissed me off with some of the stuff they wrote to me
*  But so I didn't feel bad about them so much, but that's a human failing
*  I you know, I'm not a perfect person when they pissed you off because they would they write
*  oh this one woman we wrote a paper about masculinity and
*  Hooters
*  And we said that the only reason guys go there is I mean besides the obvious wanting to ogle chicks
*  But the main reason was so that they could order like double meaning on the word order right order their food
*  They could order pretty young women around that have to do what they say
*  and you know, they can
*  Patriarchally order what it gets taking their orders. What is a pun and
*  This one woman wrote like this long review of it and she was like this
*  Paper it was remember it was submitted to a journal called men in masculinities
*  It was a paper that was supposed to study the masculinity and she wrote back this paper talks about men instead of women and it
*  Victim blames and blah blah blah blah like oh you can go to hell, you know, basically, I mean come on
*  I was aggravated also because my paper didn't get in because of that
*  It's like it's like why would a paper about men and masculinity have to be about the women. Oh because feminism that's why
*  Of course and it's like that's so annoying that it's so that that aggravated me
*  most of them rest of them were actually like
*  really nice people
*  so I think your feeling is that they're there's really nice people that get bamboozled into really bad ideas and
*  Then when you snuck in these
*  hoax papers
*  That you're essentially speaking their lingo and they don't even know that they have a link
*  That's right. And so I actually think that what we're looking at with this woke movement and you know
*  We've kind of compared it to cult we've kind of compared to real
*  I actually think it's evil and the reason is because exactly what you just said it plays on people's best nature
*  It takes good people and twists them to its purpose. Mmm, and that's horrible
*  Like the whole game is to try to make you a nicer more caring person
*  So it takes your care and turns it into something
*  Literally totalitarian you're not allowed to disagree with it anything you say you get branded with these horrible, you know
*  Stigmas they try to cancel people and it's like it's literally trying to use people's best
*  fairest most just and caring instincts to make them program into this way of thinking
*  There's also this thing that's going on particularly with people in their cars when they have marches
*  That they just decide to start smashing people's cars and doing things to people's cars
*  Whether it's because the people don't agree with what they're saying or they choose someone or they don't like the look of that person
*  But they feel justified in the violently attacking them and their car right because they are there to do a good thing
*  that's right, yeah, whenever somebody's gonna punish people and
*  Think it's the moral thing to do. That's where you've got some danger going on
*  Yeah, and the reason they do that by the way is because they think everything happening is violence
*  Like if why does Antifa by the way, that's the fourth Black Lives Matter movement is these Antifa agitators starting the riots
*  Why do they feel justified and throwing a brick through a Starbucks?
*  Why do they feel justified and starting or yelling about targets?
*  Why does this keep happening and the reason this is going to sound absolutely insane?
*  But it's actually true is that they believe that something like Starbucks is a big corporation and when it comes into a neighborhood it starts taking
*  resources
*  Capitalist resources money from that neighborhood and then dumping it into corporation and they see that as a form of violence against the neighborhood
*  So they're justified in using violence to disrupt that by throwing a brick through the window
*  Even though it's probably some franchise owners just trying to make a buck trying to have a job that runs it. That's crazy
*  Yeah, I mean it's it is that's that's actually what the theoretical justification is with with regard to that aspect of the theory
*  These people were actually doing this know this that that's why they're doing it or I mean is this written anywhere?
*  Oh, yeah, the Antifa books are crazy
*  They talk about the collection of capital the the you know
*  Any kind of racist or sexist or whatever language as they want to determine it being a form of violence
*  They call these things like epistemic violence and in some of the literature
*  They call it discursive violence and some of the literature sometimes they just call it violence and queer theory
*  You know calling somebody saying you're a man or a woman is called a violence of categorization
*  So there's all these different types of violence and they're sort of
*  Marinating in this idea that these things that are happening the way people talk
*  Microassault is of violence and I mean I even saw a thing somebody sent me today from
*  some University, Indiana, maybe where the person saying that
*  You know there were tearing down these physical monuments, but maybe we need to think about discursive. So
*  Verbal monuments and then in the middle of this which is otherwise
*  Cracked was you know, not violent
*  He actually says something to the effect of that we we really need to be prepared to do violence against this violence
*  And so they're marinating in these kinds of thoughts. So you get these like like with Antifa
*  What are these dudes these dudes are like hopped up mostly young men trying to put out?
*  I mean, there's some women in there too, of course
*  But there's a lot of young men who are like doing their young male rage and they're pissed off at society
*  And they've read all these books saying how America sucks and how it hurts, you know all these, you know poor people it hurts
*  You know minorities and so on a lot of people are feeling the sting frankly
*  Because the whatever the Republican policies since Reagan have really kind of like put some squeeze on people
*  Well, it's really amplified now because of kovat because they locked. Oh, yeah, exactly. People are out of their minds. They're living on Twitter
*  They're living on Twitter and also they're broke and they're exactly you're losing your job justified to loot
*  They feel justified smash and rob and they don't even have to really
*  Intellectualize that are really like when they're rationalizing this they don't have to really make coach and points
*  They just have to have like some
*  Iconic enemy in their right
*  We really should have saw Target getting set on fire when Target got deemed essential and the people started making a big deal about
*  Targets essential why is target essential because you need to buy toilet paper you fuck
*  Jesus Christ, that's right. What's weird is I mean, it's just weird how quickly it happened
*  And it clearly exacerbated by the lockdowns. That's right
*  One of the most amazing
*  Like combination of events that happens in a perfect storm order, right? And so it's okay
*  I'm not let me start right and this is already bad, but I'm not a conspiracy theorist
*  I don't actually buy into conspiracies
*  But we are in a situation because of a lot of political currents for the last 50 years
*  Where there's a lot of billionaire philanthropist groups, right that generate a lot of money. They run a lot of think tanks
*  They run a lot of like policy forums and organizations and 501 c3s and so on and so forth to study things and do these things
*  the rapidity with which the
*  materials like the
*  like Instagram ready
*  Tracks that you could read and the little videos the speed in that the educational curricula and the guides for here's a bunch of resources
*  For for how to remake your your business this stuff came out fast
*  So what I think is actually going on is I mean political operative types wait for I mean saying has never let a good crisis
*  Go to waste, right?
*  So they wait for a precipitating event and then they've been making
*  Easy digest materials for a long time and paying people like, you know, hey come work for our forum
*  What we really need to do is look at how we can get books for like anti-racist toddler books
*  You know anti-racist kids and so they get people writing these books and I think they're doing it's not like some you know
*  Boardroom nasty stuff and
*  Then these materials are just ready to go out fast
*  And so this we had as you said a perfect storm Cove
*  It's pissing it like co it's pissing everybody off. The media has everybody pissed off Trump has everybody pissed off
*  It's like impossible to watch any of this and not be just pissed off my I have to be careful because I actually start to get
*  frustrated and emotional about it
*  The the amount of being lied to that's just so obvious, you know through a lot of the news right now at these protests
*  Especially in riots. It's just galling
*  well the article that I showed you that shows that the
*  Covid kick up the uptake in cases had nothing to do with black lives matter, but probably had to do with people staying inside
*  Yeah, it's it's like this gas lighting man
*  But that's the craziest gas lighting ever like so why are you making everybody stay inside then?
*  Because that means that the disease is gonna get even worse, right?
*  Like if we're being forced to lock in and shut down and shut and stay home
*  That's gonna make the disease worse according to your article they're like, which way does it go and nobody knows and then you live in
*  This like I don't know what what's true about
*  Covid at all now. It's like you were allowed to go out in like groups less than ten
*  But not if you were protesting then they could be up to a thousand or so
*  I mean, it's like it'd be multiple thousands like what in the world is going on once you're protesting and if long as it's a good
*  Cause everybody could die. Yeah, exactly. It's fine. It's because racism is the real virus is what they actually said
*  Well, that's a real virus too, but that kovat shit's real trust me
*  It's it's I know I know multiple people that have it right now
*  I also know people who have had it and a couple who do it's not good. Not good. Not good
*  Yeah, like yeah, even young people
*  Yeah
*  Like they're still going to those like my friends are still going to the hospital because they don't quite know what's wrong with them after
*  Having had vitamin D kids take a shitload of it. Very important get out in the Sun
*  It took like 50,000 IU before I flew out here. Yes. Good move. I take 5,000 IU every day
*  Yeah, so do I without fail. Yeah, and I take zinc and I take magnesium
*  And I take 4000 milligrams of vitamin C and I take I do a 10,000 milligram vitamin C
*  IV every week. Holy shit. Yeah, I'm not fucking around
*  I still get nervous
*  Well, you don't want to get the kovat. I'm scared. Yeah, I'm serious
*  It's serious and people are scared and you know, you can channel that fear you can channel that anger
*  I know and I'm healthy right imagine if I was obese or had diabetes or oh you can't talk about that. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, that's a fat shaming. Yeah obesity is not allowed to be talked about as a medical relevant condition that is called medicalizing obesity
*  I love Jon Stewart to death
*  He's amazing
*  But we did a podcast the other day and he actually said you can be overweight and be healthy and I had to stop him
*  I said no, you can't
*  That's not true. You're you that's literally it shows that you have an issue. That's like that's a sign of non-health
*  Yeah of not being healthy. It's a tax on your body
*  Yeah, for sure your body works harder
*  But he's just so nice right that he wanted to say it because it's a thing that people like to say and he wanted
*  He wanted those people to like him. Well, it's the same after it's exactly what we're saying
*  It's using that that impulse to be kind that impulse to be nice and turning it into something and that narrative
*  That that there's nothing to do with health like they actually it's trademarked and everything health at every size. Yeah, there's a movement
*  Actually, there was a blog I used to follow
*  That's where I first learned about it that it was called dances with fat and is this woman who's very overweight who danced around
*  and she's a good dancer actually she really was and
*  then she tried to run a marathon and she couldn't run the marathon because she didn't what she
*  Finished the marathon but there was a time limit and she finished after the time limit
*  So she lost her marbles about it and said, you know that the time limits are oppressive and fat exclusionary and all this
*  Like nine hours or something and then so she then created another blog called iron fat where she was going to run
*  She was gonna do an Ironman but fat Wow fat to prove that fat has nothing to do with health
*  Well the little swimming part she's got down because she she could take her time because she's floating
*  That's harsh. That's true. Fat people float actually in cold water. They lose a lot of weight, too
*  I don't know if you know that that people who swim the English Channel actually have to gain weight so they can swim off
*  Oh, that was that cold water. Yeah, you actually do like almost 20 pounds. Oh, it makes sense
*  Yeah, cuz it's a massive caloric requirement to keep your body warm and that's freezing water. Yes, it was that Phelps
*  Olympic swimmer. Oh, yeah, where he was eating like
*  15,000 calories a day and staying like cut ripped giant pizzas and shit
*  Yeah, but he's swimming in 68 degree water 72 degree water for four hours a day or something. Makes sense
*  Yeah, so
*  Yeah, they they have this whole thing though that it dancing that is a well, yeah the iron fat lady
*  They have this whole thing that you can't
*  Associate obesity and health at all. Yes. It's not allowed. It's considered
*  It's considered a medicalizing narrative and if we were to come up with let's say that like you invented tomorrow Joe Rogan's, you know
*  You can a supplement company and Joe Rogan's weight loss pill, but not like some bullshit. Imagine it really worked, right?
*  So everybody who takes this pill within the course of a month would get to their their ideal body weight, right by
*  Pill magic just imagine they would actually in fat studies, which is a real critical fat studies. It's a real thing
*  We wrote we wrote a paper about that too. They would call that a fat genocide because you're getting rid of all the fat people
*  But every one of them healthier of them they are they are healthier, but they can always choose to be fat again
*  So that's the problem with this shit is it plays on people's best instincts while giving like the worst possible reading of everything
*  Right like they literally would and I takes away personal accountability as well, right?
*  They actually say that and in disability studies about people who are deaf if they invented
*  Surgery or whatever that fixed deafness or an implant that could fix deafness for everybody
*  They say it's a deaf genocide because there'd be no deaf people left. They really say that. Yeah
*  And so I mean you can see it's just like that's so silly restoring a sense is a
*  Genocide on people who are handicapped as somebody who's lost senses
*  I can tell you you want them back or you want them to have them if you don't they you were saying when you had
*  Your head injury that you couldn't taste anything. Yeah, so I hit my head really bad in January 2011 and cracked my skull and
*  Pull ups pull up bar came apart. Oh my god
*  I was doing those badass ones where you pull up and then touch your feet
*  so I was horizontal seven feet off the ground and the pull-up bar came apart and
*  Oh back of the head on concrete. Oh my god, dude. Oh, it's bad, man
*  It was bad like my ears were ringing for like a month. Oh
*  I'll tell you this cuz you fight so you'll understand I hit my head the back of my head so hard that I deviated my
*  Septum. Oh my nothing hit my nose, but my my nostrils aren't the same as they were before ever since God
*  So I woke up the next morning
*  I mean I didn't go to sleep for a long time because I'm I've got a concussion
*  I'm fucked and so then I get up eventually the next morning after I decide I can sleep because my pupils aren't doing any
*  of the things and I
*  Drank my coffee. I'm like man my coffee tastes really weird. I'm really knocked silly and then I realized sometime during the day
*  I couldn't smell anything and I couldn't taste anything
*  And so then I went through this process for like two years of growing those senses back
*  I actually think you learn to smell and taste things
*  I think that's why kids hate vegetables is like they haven't learned how to process the taste yet
*  And like stuff tasted really weird I had phases where like my coffee and garlic and you know
*  Like grape juice would all taste exactly the same. I know a fighter and
*  He's had a long career and after one of his fights. He lost his sense of smell. It happens
*  Yeah, you saying that what drove him crazy was he couldn't smell his daughter's hair. Yeah, like you would hug his daughter
*  Yeah, he couldn't it's so weird. Everything's just neutral. It's so weird. It's really it's depressing
*  I was like putting like Vicks vapor rub like right under my nose. I couldn't smell it
*  I would just kind of burn on the skin and what were doctors saying as far as the
*  Recovery they said sometimes it recovers and sometimes it doesn't it's about 5% of back-of-the-head concussions and mine came back
*  And I think it's mostly back to normal. I mean I learned the hard way
*  About a year ago that I still couldn't smell spoiled milk. Oh, you can't spell
*  Now because this is why I think you learn it because oh so now you can if I if you can't smell when I when I
*  Look for me my experience was that if I couldn't smell or taste something and I just kept forcing myself to have it
*  It before long I could and then it would start to taste normal really but anything that I avoided
*  So one when I ever drink spoiled milk when would I experience spoiled milk?
*  So all of a sudden I came home from a trip like last year and I'm like, you know
*  I busted open the cream from my coffee and I've like poured it in and I'm like this is a
*  Sour coffee like there's like a new coffee
*  So I thought was maybe just like really acidic like this is really kind of gross and I walked by my wife and she's like
*  Pour that uh, you know, what is that?
*  She could smell it out of my coffee even and then I couldn't smell it
*  But then I started to I actually it's kind of gross
*  But I actually bought a bottle of milk and just let it go bad
*  So you could practice my practice smelling it now I can smell it you're practicing the smell it would come back
*  Yeah
*  and so what the doctor said when I hit my head though is that the two things are
*  Happening one happens in the brain and they don't know what's going on and the other is that the nerve fibers through the ethmoid bone in
*  your nose either can stretch or tear and
*  Those have to if they do they go dormant and they have to wake back up over time
*  So I got lucky I suppose because mine seems to be more or less back to normal but a year ago
*  Well, obviously, yeah, well things you still have an issue. So there's anything that I haven't encountered
*  I probably won't smell correctly. What about farts? What kind of farts you smelling? I'm
*  regular fart, I think I got those covered at this point. I have a lot of practice those two
*  Yeah, because some farts are different. Yeah, that's right
*  Yeah, but about gases, you know, that was a thing right? I couldn't smell like I couldn't smell smoke for a long time
*  That's scary. That was actually properly scary
*  When you realize you can't smell smoke it's scary
*  Yeah
*  Because it's like how you know if your house is on fire
*  It's like I wouldn't I didn't want my wife to leave
*  And like, you know go on a trip for like a week because they're like something caught on fire cooking gas
*  I couldn't smell that either. I can't now I couldn't smell anything. That's terrifying come home
*  You don't even know when your house is filled with gas. Yeah, have you ever seen what happens to a house when they have a gas explosion?
*  Yeah, actually somebody emailed me and said that that's what they're afraid of in Minneapolis with all these riots that they broke out
*  They were about they were pretty sure some of the fires were gonna hit the gas lines
*  And it would have been like in Boston a couple years ago when the gas line was leaking and 50 houses
*  I know a Boston firefighter who told me what it was like to be a firefighter in that mess
*  He's driving to a call and then you know people run out in the street and stop, you know
*  Stop the fire truck and they're like, you know, they're yelling and there's a fire
*  We can't stop and they're like there's a fire here and they get they like crap
*  Start trying to do something about the fire there and then the house over there's boom, you know flames everywhere walls blow down and stuff
*  Yeah, and it was just like at that point. They were like, is this a terrorist attack? What's going on?
*  People are freaking out but that's what people in Minneapolis just lived through apparently too. Yeah, like this you can't have mayhem
*  It's not good for sleep. It's not good for it's not good for it's not good for anything. Yeah
*  Yeah, I was gonna say that's a Jerry Seinfeld. Yeah that thing. It's not good for business. It's not good for anybody
*  for sign film
*  I saw a video once of a house that it was after the fact this house had a slow gas leak and then it blew up and
*  It I mean there was nothing left. It's bad. It was crazy. It was like it was splinters. It's bad. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's it's it's exactly right splinters. Yeah
*  So yeah, it was pretty scary. He couldn't smell gas
*  Couldn't smell gasoline if you're pumping gasoline. No, and then I had this phase or house right here. Watch this. Holy
*  Hell
*  Yeah
*  Bro, do that again rewind that again. So this is someone else like I was looking at house. Let's see what happens. Boom
*  So that's why stuff has to work
*  Yeah
*  Well again, it goes back to what you're saying. How easy is to tear something down how hard it is to build it?
*  That's right. All these people that are tearing down these businesses and looting then they haven't built anything
*  I mean I think about it all the time
*  It's like there's almost like this weird belief it like everything just happens by magic or something
*  Like you can just go like fire everybody who knows what they're doing and replace them with people who don't know what they're doing
*  And I want to be just diversity like and I'm not even to say they're not competent
*  But they do want to focus on diversity or whatever the the issue of the day is so you're gonna fire like
*  This super competent guy and then replace them with somebody who at least is gonna dedicate some of their time to diversity initiatives
*  What's going to happen is eventually?
*  Stuff becomes less competitive stuff becomes less efficient
*  I really feel it when I fly man, and it's not the thing you think I don't think all the planes are gonna start dropping out
*  Of the sky. I start thinking about the air traffic control like that's
*  Complicated man, and if you don't have people that are at the top of their game
*  Programming that stuff in those towers looking at that stuff, but it's everything
*  We actually have a society when we have an advanced society like we have
*  You actually have to have people who know what's going on and we're focusing on the job
*  To get it done to build things and it can't all be
*  I mean we of course we have to
*  Pay attention to the human resources issue
*  But this stuff's all about turning everything into the human resources issue and then with like scholarship
*  I don't even know what to say because they're saying we need to do research justice and like so that means take research
*  Justice is what they call it so there you have to take yeah
*  So you have to like cite more black scholars and women scholars and indigenous scholars
*  And so you don't cite white people or men
*  So you can even out their citation scores so they get more promotions, and then you have to you have to take
*  Academic departments, and you have to start hiring more of and I don't mean you have to hire
*  Identities you have to hire people who think that way because otherwise they don't qualify and then
*  You
*  Start getting rid of the people who don't think that way so you're actually
*  Concentrating even in like I mean somebody just sent me something about the chemistry
*  The field of chemistry is like going like full woke and it's like what the hell does that have to do with chemistry?
*  How can chemistry go woke chemistry is so I mean that is like one of the more solid disciplines
*  You really you'll hardly believe it
*  But the truth is that they the woke theory actually believes this it actually believes that
*  science reason so on
*  Evidence civility meeting schedules
*  That's all manifestations of one way of knowing things about the world that happens to be made by white people who are westerners and men
*  And that it encodes white supremacy and that we have to open up to other ways of knowing I read an article
*  I'm a mathematician and I read an article recently about how that has to happen in math
*  So math we have to get away from it says the idea that math is objective
*  That it tells you something objective about the world
*  We have to start opening our minds up to other types of mathematics that maybe see things differently and that we should teach that
*  What's his name? I don't know there's a there's another one that's very similar. That's by a Chinese scholar
*  Tianan or on ten
*  I get it backwards sometimes that came out in
*  January or something that was saying the same thing that we need to start questioning whether there's objectivity in math
*  We need to question what math's about and then I see this curriculum last fall
*  It was an input into the Seattle schools and you can look that up on Seattle's like government education website
*  And they're like we need to question we need to look at how how we need to make math class be like asking kids
*  how
*  How have you seen math be used to uphold
*  Oppression how have you seen math be used to break down oppression?
*  And then how can we turn math to a more collectivist endeavor instead of intellectual individual endeavor?
*  And it's like this is what they're teaching in schools at this point
*  So there's a their belief is that objective II objectivity like actual knowledge is not possible and that every culture has its own
*  access to it and
*  Those cultures like we talked about conflict theory are in conflict with one another
*  So science is something that was cooked up by white Western men and it doesn't let other ways of knowing they call it in
*  Specifically so that white Western men can take can keep the power of getting you to define what scientifically true and what's not Jesus Christ
*  No shit, how do you argue against that? It's so crazy that it's it's like there's no room for logic or reason
*  It's worse than that because logic and reason become part of the the problem the white man's tools the masters tools they call it
*  In Texas there's at least one real estate group that's no longer using the term master bedroom
*  I was gonna bring that one up earlier when we were talking about how you know words have a trace
*  Yeah, and it's like that's a key example because the trace is bullshit. You know where the phrase master bedroom started
*  No, 1926 Sears catalog
*  Oh
*  slavery ended in 1863
*  1926 Sears catalog it was never used with anything to do with slavery
*  It's just that people imagine that it might have something to do with slavery because you can't touch the word math or master
*  I'm sorry, right. What about master locks? Oh, it'll come to it. It'll come to it
*  I have to change all of the tech stuff is they've got like master slave switches or whatever they call them and
*  Systems all that I mean, I'm getting emails from corporation motherboards. Oh, yeah all that stuff all that stuff
*  It's all got to get changed. Oh
*  Yeah, you can't have master and slave you assholes and here's why because they actually believe that if they change that they believe that language
*  Creates oppression. That's when I said tearing down discursive monuments. That's actually what the guy was talking about
*  So if you change the language
*  Like magic spells then oppression will go away, too
*  If we have no politically incorrect language oppression can't possibly happen. That's literally some Orwell stuff, right?
*  Of 1984 was like they made
*  New speak so that people wouldn't be able to have thoughts
*  Yes, I mean how brilliant was Orwell pretty brilliant
*  But yeah amazing that he saw all this kind of coming but maybe he didn't
*  Maybe he just made it in the mullet. He took it to some ridiculous place that he never really thought people would go, right?
*  I mean, there's been a bunch of people who did that of course, you know, I'll just Huxley talked about it and brave new world
*  but
*  And very famously now people are getting aware of was it Kurt Vonnegut? They wrote Harrison Berger on
*  So this is a perfect equity society
*  So people who were smarter had to like have headphones and that played annoying sounds they couldn't think it's good
*  And if they were pretty they had to wear like a mask so that they wouldn't be as attractive and they tried to make everybody
*  Perfectly equal and it's like almost prophetic, you know
*  And that's the problem right so this idea of like
*  The idea should be that we're that we have equality equality of outcome cannot be guaranteed but they want to force it
*  But if you were going to guarantee equality of outcome, right?
*  It would obviously be that you wanted to bring everybody up
*  But they're content when that doesn't work to just chop people down and that's why it's screwed up
*  Right. Yeah, so now we can't use science because science doesn't use emotions. You can't use chemistry
*  You can't use chemistry because it doesn't have enough gay people working and it was actually the real argument that I saw
*  But how do you so is it your obligation to convince gay people that chemistry is interesting for them to pursue as a career it's
*  Yeah, I guess I mean you have to prove
*  In there's no obligation to prove there's been some sort of suppression of gay people
*  You could just say like as a fact there's less gay people that are involved in this so it must be suppressed
*  So yeah, that's the systemic racism idea or systemic, you know homophobia here
*  That's the idea when they say systemic that's what they mean
*  They say we're gonna look at the end is anything different than it must have been discrimination somewhere in the system
*  It's like when you know all the atheist movement stuff back in the day that the god of the gaps, you know
*  It's like where did life come from?
*  If you know the gate religious person be like, oh if you're an atheist explain where life came from and if you don't know then
*  It must be God and now it's like if there's different outcomes
*  Explain where it came from. It must be racist, you know racism or sexism
*  What's interesting is that this equality language never makes its way into blue-collar jobs
*  Like nobody's clamoring for female garbage men. Yeah garbage folk
*  It's only for for high-status jobs, especially ones that work in cultural production, right?
*  So you have faith you have education you have journalism you have media in general
*  It's in scientists and so on people who get to control
*  Knowledge ideas and so on because again they they live in this world where they believe that if they can engineer how people think
*  By what ideas are valid and invalid then they can make their their utopia
*  So it's I mean anything like the idea of inclusion, right? So inclusion like that's good. We want to include people
*  We don't want people to feel like left out. We don't people people feel uncomfortable. Well, they can't be there
*  But when you cook the books and decide that anything that disagrees with you makes you feel unwelcome
*  Now all of a sudden nobody's allowed to disagree with you, right?
*  And that's actually what happens and then when you have this idea you see this in these videos for these universities
*  Where you'll have some little students stand up and say well this center has too many white people in it taking up space and that
*  Makes us feel uncomfortable because we're used to you know, having our space taken up and we have no space of our own
*  You know and like the most egalitarian the whole campus you can be anywhere you want but they need like there
*  It's so it even justified segregation. You can't have white people around black people too much because that makes them feel
*  unsafe and then the galling part is that you know what they call that
*  desegregation
*  They call it desegregating the space gaslighting. It's so gaslighting God
*  Anti-racism is like let's focus on race all the time. Let's read racism and do every interaction. That's the anti-racist process
*  Yeah, it's backwards. It's backwards land
*  Well, that's one of the problems with some ideas that promote air quotes
*  Feminism is that they treat women as if they they can't
*  See things the way that men do so they need extra
*  attention or extra help or extra
*  Assistance my favorite one with with like that kind of like
*  naval gazing critical approach
*  So let me preface just because we have to in this day and age James you support feminism
*  Which one same as Black Lives Matter, right? Which one do you mean? So that said
*  One of my favorite patterns is is thing happens to everybody and then feminists think it's oppression against women feminist blame patriarchy
*  So it's like, you know people interrupt and it's like people interrupt women and so that's patriarchy
*  And it's like it actually happens to everybody man. My favorite is man-splaining man-splaining. Oh, yeah, we're doing that now
*  My favorite is man spreading as you will know
*  Famously a man spreader and I have my profile on Twitter is man spreading to the maximum
*  Is that what you're doing in your profile? Oh, yeah, it's actually funny. I was doing the thing in London last October
*  We're doing some talks and I was actually explained
*  I had one video I did where I didn't even realize it and I was man spreading like out of control
*  I mean it was like embarrassingly bad
*  I looked at it the first one was so the video but man spreading only matters if you're on a subway or
*  Someone's next to you and you're that's the main thing but that's what the problem is with it, right?
*  But they see the action at all like you got to train it out of people
*  So anyway in London, I was very I was actually distractedly mindful not to man spread
*  And so I was telling the story to the crowd and I man spread to demonstrate what I meant by man
*  I just did it again and somebody snapped a picture of it while I was doing it and sent it to me and I'm like
*  That's my profile picture
*  You know like a jacket and a tie and I'm man spreading like laughing or whatever I feel like I read this
*  I don't know if I did or not that men there are natural the way their their legs sit in their hips
*  It's natural for their legs to splay out. Yeah, whereas with women their hips are built differently. That's probably true
*  Well, can you find that out? We also have I don't know how you would Google that. Yeah, but I mean, I think you do
*  I know I do. Okay, definitely do just check. How dare you?
*  But you can't I'd rather stand up. I mean if I'm jamming people in like that, I don't mind standing. Yeah, totally
*  I hear you. Yeah, unless it's a long ass flight but or a long ass
*  Train ride, but I can keep my legs. Yeah. No, I hear you. I'm totally with you, but I think it's a natural thing
*  I think it makes sense and like I mean you're fit. I'm fit. I actually have
*  Bizarrely large legs and so it's actually very difficult for me to squeeze my legs here it goes
*  The overall width of the pelvis is relatively greater in females and the angle of the femoral neck is more acute
*  That's right
*  These factors could play a role in making a position of sitting with the knees close together less comfortable in men
*  Aha, you fucks
*  I suspect most men would suggest the reason for adopting the more spread posture in
*  Sitting would be the avoidance of testicular compression from the thigh muscles
*  The pelvic rotation goes some way to improve compression in both aspects. It's funny the way they say it that way
*  That's right. They have to say testicular compression because it's from masculine science
*  Masculinist white Western science making this claim and it's from the independent. Okay. Yeah, but when you have big legs, man
*  It's like yes, it's like, you know, I find out I'm gonna have to walk a long distance after wear the right underwear
*  I'm gonna get chafed on my thighs. Yes, big thighs. So there's a problem behind man's it's like I need those like
*  Chuck Norris drop crotch jeans that he had those when he says kicks to those you remember those
*  I had a pair of those hell. Yeah Chuck Norris action action jeans. That's right. Yeah, I had those. That's right
*  Back when were you doing karate? You know, you're doing taekwondo, right? Yeah, I did like sport karate back then
*  So yeah, those were those that were the pants to have that's right. Everybody everybody had that stuff
*  Yeah, those the people with large thighs man. That's what boxer briefs were invented for. That's right. I can't wear
*  Regular shorts like if I just wear shorts and boxer briefs, it'll chew my legs up. That's right. I work out it kills me
*  Yeah, yeah and large ladies have that issue too, right?
*  They're overweight and fat studies would say that that is a problem of body blueprinting and it's actually a sign that fat
*  Phobic society hasn't designed all clothing around that problem. They didn't design clothing with those in mind
*  Another one of my favorite papers. He did it was fat body. That's what I was. Yeah
*  Yeah, fat body building fat body building
*  So it turns out Peter has a friend and Richard Baldwin and you should pull Richard Baldwin up
*  Richard Baldwin is a real professional bodybuilder. He was like, what was it? Mr
*  Olympia 1978 or something, right? And he's also a history professor. So dudes jacked even 70 something he's jacked and so
*  He said we could use his identity to do our papers that's him as in the 70s. Yeah
*  That is that him now
*  He's got his one in a black t-shirt where it's like he's 71 years old and it's just
*  Back in the day upper. Yeah, the one the one where he's doing the most muscular pose right there. Bam
*  He's still like that and Jesus Christ, so he let us use his identity
*  That that's him older he's still jacked he's 65 there
*  He's in he's fit
*  So we were like we got to write bodybuilding themed papers because we have a bodybuilder
*  Mm-hmm. And so we claim that his is there is the black one related images down there is where he's in the black t-shirt
*  I actually photoshopped a copy of that that specific image and put fat bodybuilder on the t-shirt. I
*  Used to have that picture. That's him like when he was letting us use his identity
*  So there he's in the 70s. I think he's like 71 there. That's insane. Yeah, look at those arms Wow and
*  Yeah, so we wrote this paper fat bodybuilding saying that
*  Bodybuilders are abnormally large fat people are abnormally large muscle and fat are just two types of tissue
*  And it's only fat phobic science that distinguishes their worth and fat phobic society that says one means more than the other
*  So we even had lines like, you know, you have to build a politic. There's some quote
*  It's not it wasn't our line. We quoted somebody that says it takes time to build a fat body
*  It takes even more time to be able to politicize fat body
*  So that was the theme of the paper and so we said that there should be in fact that professional bodybuilding is a sport needs
*  To add another category
*  There are four categories for each of men and women that they compete in apparently something like bikini and I don't know what they
*  Whatever they are. Yeah something there for and I don't remember what they are but
*  They need to add a fifth one in for fat bodybuilding where people of any body shape and size can come in and it can't be competitive
*  Because that would be fat shaming and so it has to be just a political performative display rooted in Judith Butler's politics of parody
*  Which we got that idea from reading an actual fat scholar
*  Maybe the leading fat scholar Charlotte Cooper and Charlotte Cooper is just like totally not job activists in the UK
*  But they hate the Olympics as you might imagine
*  It's the maximally fat fat phobic environment except sumo in the Olympics. Is it I think it is
*  But
*  They protested the 2000 and she's in London. So they protested the 2012 games summer games and
*  What they did is they held in a park like fatty Olympics is what they literally called it
*  They literally called it that and it was like them playing dizzy bat and like yelling about and holding up protest signs about how the Olympics
*  sucks
*  And so we're like what in the hell is this and so then we decided to write this fat bodybuilding paper based off of the idea of
*  Politics of parody of like making a joke out of the thing
*  So we're gonna make a joke at a bodybuilding and we said that competitors can wear the faction
*  That's their word not ours of their choice, which is clothing designed for fat people
*  So it's really hard it's really hard to crit to talk about to explain to criticize the the fat study stuff without like it's just so
*  preposterous, how do you walk the line of like
*  Tipping them off like because it seems like I mean some of your stuff is so loony that I just so like
*  How do they not know they're being fucked with because they're too serious about that. They take themselves too seriously
*  So I'll give you an example with that exact paper, right at the end Pete, you know is a big sci-fi guy
*  So he's on the Star Trek. So we called the last section was fat bodybuilding the final frontier for fat
*  They went berserk about this. They were like you cannot call it that for two reasons
*  You can't use the word final because it would imply there is an end to fat activism, which can never end
*  And you can't use the word frontier because it reminds you of genocides
*  Like the frontier of the American West that it said it evokes imagery of the American genocide
*  So you can't say the final frontier because frontier the word
*  Poisoned and it was final frontier, but that's Star Trek. I know how are you doing that?
*  They're so like I mean smelling their own farts man, they're smelling their own farts all day long
*  So so freaking bad. I can't I can't I'm like as you're saying this
*  I know you're telling the truth, but I I can't imagine that this is this is literally commonplace
*  I mean, it's it's so hard not to laugh. I mean like so we talked about health at every size
*  You know who made up health at every size who Linda bacon?
*  That's her name. She's not real. She's
*  It's like and it's like it's just her name it just happens to be crazy though. What a great name
*  It just shows you that the work like when Andrew wiener kept sending his dick to girls. I know come on man
*  This is two on the nose. Oh Jesus when I was in grad school actually we had to learn about
*  So there's this thing in probability theory. It's named after a mathematician whose last name is wiener
*  And so it's actually called the wiener measure and so we had this Chinese teacher
*  He was talking about the wiener measure and we're all laughing and he had no idea why we were laughing because
*  His English wasn't great. Oh, it was such so awkward. Oh boy, but no it's really weird when stuff like that happens
*  You know, so you have the fat scholar. Yeah, Linda Linda bacon Linda. Oh
*  formerly
*  Trans went trans trans now Linda. Oh, that's see health at every time. Oh my god
*  So she wasn't happy enough with body positivity. She had to go trans it became real popular looks like she lost the weight, too
*  That's bad Christ. Yeah, why'd she lose the weight? I don't know what we could record
*  Every size body positivity at every size body liberation advocate
*  Yeah, liberation is what this is actually the thing speaker author and
*  Scientist I'm gonna call shenanigans on that last part. She's got a PhD. Yeah
*  Um, what's the PhD in? I don't know, but it's not math
*  Lindo I didn't I didn't mean the dead name or I didn't know it had changed
*  Well, you didn't mean it. I could be ruined for that
*  It's dead naming her right into things as formally Linda. It does. I mean they dead named her
*  Technically the book technically, I think we have to update our book now
*  Yeah, what which which one is it? It says Lindo question mark Linda. What is that? Is that an article?
*  That's insane my name my gender. Oh, yeah, see
*  So she she like formally Linda is a part of her website
*  Linda bacon, okay. So this is straight out of queer theory
*  So queer theory actually says that it's politically actionable to make things confusing on purpose
*  So it doesn't make sense. I mean, yeah, it's like they literally I can if I open the book I can quote it
*  They say that it's politically actionable to use intentional confusion like to put contradictions and in particular Eve
*  Kovsavsky Sedgwick
*  Hold on
*  Sedgwick
*  Hold up. Look at look at how this starts off
*  It's hard to be yourself and feel belonging in a culture that it's hostile to your existence for but first of all
*  feel belonging
*  So very strange way to put it. It's hard to be yourself and feel belonging that you belong
*  I guess yeah culture that is hostile to your existence
*  Which but that's that's a loaded sentence. Yes. Oh my god so much
*  Yeah, yeah, so I mean
*  Let's see. There's probably some really good stuff and flourish in a welcoming world the welcoming part
*  That's where I said they twist this stuff and it's something crazy
*  mmm
*  So you get this real sense though in fat studies and in disability studies that there's like it's they want to be coddled
*  And how is she doing fat studies when she's all skinny now? I mean that's he now
*  That's problematic is so but that's a good thing it's every size
*  Dr. Bacon's mission. Hold on
*  That's okay
*  We would say there to galvanize a body positivity movement which celebrates the influence of our multiple intersecting identities
*  To provide the critical thought inspiring vision and practical strategies you need to celebrate and I feel like we're making gas person
*  I told you but that word critical that doesn't mean critical thinking
*  Right. I mean complaining about in a specific way to to achieve liberation and liberation is the thing
*  That's the critical theory of the Frankfurt School that we're talking about all along. So what is this?
*  Persons what was what was the issue that you had with what they're teaching? Well, I mean they're saying it's this person is like the body
*  positivity person so the body positivity movement is
*  Just all about I was actually just bringing up the person's name being bacon and fat studies is kind of funny
*  But that's rude of me, but it's crazy
*  But the point is that the the the body positivity movement is why they deny science, right? So if like a doctor says
*  We're worried about your weight, you know, you need to do something about it. That actually is not body positivity anymore
*  That's now telling them that
*  They are wrong for who they are
*  So this is like coddling aspect to it and then this has actually moved into even more they go even further
*  They're like people with letters that I don't need a person with letters after my name to tell me who I am
*  So with like mental illness, they like a lot of them
*  Self diagnose and they say that somebody with letters after the name shouldn't
*  Determine who they are and
*  There's this woman that we talked about in the book
*  Linda XY Brown, I'm sure that's her real initials like she didn't cook that up
*  She's got like 12 of the things but she self-diagnosed herself as autistic and she has this thing
*  We quoted it in here and she says that
*  She I guess there's a there's a stem they call them for autistic people called flapping and she doesn't flap
*  Like it's not one of the things because she maybe isn't even autistic who knows because she won't get diagnosed and then
*  She when she says she's in public she flaps on purpose like she acts it she pretends it so that people will recognize her as autistic
*  Because the identity is what's so important because the identity becomes my goodness
*  My goodness just read the whole freaking book again yesterday
*  So the thing about body positivity is I want people to feel good
*  I do want to feel good, but I also want them to be
*  Actually
*  aware of what the consequences of
*  Eating bad food is like if you care about someone you want them to know what the consequence of their actions like it's one of the weird
*  addictions food addictions one of the weird addictions where you
*  You're supposed to not judge the person by it
*  and you're also supposed to not offer up any suggestions on how they can fix that because
*  Then you are not just judging that person you're condemning them and their choices and so it is an addiction
*  Right and there's an issue because wellness means more than your feelings. Yeah, and it's actually
*  really I
*  Mean, it's like, you know with addiction medicine they talk about enablers, right? Well also with addiction they talk about hitting rock bottom
*  Like what does that mean?
*  You have to get to a point where you're so sick of the way you're living that you will make the necessary
*  Adjustments to become a healthier person right whether it's gambling where you lose all your money or a drug addiction
*  Are you almost overdose and die? Right exactly. Yeah, that's rock bottom and for a fat person
*  It's it's really gotta be that it's gonna be like, you know a heart attack scare or something
*  Right or a doctor telling you or you know, you've got a problem
*  And then that's not allowed like right here she actually says
*  Once I started to get into the territory of diagnosis once I started playing around with the problem of diagnostic thinking
*  When it is only left to trained diagnosticians
*  That allowed me to challenge how all of us must contend with thinking diagnostically
*  And so it says right before that
*  In fact
*  I don't believe in giving power to the medical industrial complex and its
*  Monopoly over getting to define and determine who counts and who does not count as autistic. That's how they
*  Like doctors aren't allowed and then she's right here right? How do they decide whether or not someone's autistic?
*  It's not like I have no idea you could check to see if they're diabetic
*  You know, I have no idea what the process is
*  But I assume that the people who are the doctors that study it do know imagine if they didn't we're finding this out. Oh, no
*  But yeah, here's the flapping thing right? So what is flapping? I don't know
*  I'm assuming it's like actually moving. Yeah, your arms almost penguin. Maybe yeah
*  Here we go. Jamie's on the fucking ball as always when a person with autism engages in self-stimulatory
*  Behaviour such as rocking pacing aligning or spinning objects or hand flapping people around him or her you asshole
*  Yeah, maybe confused offended or even frightened also known as stimming these behaviors are often characterized by rigid
*  repetitive movements and or vocal sounds right so she
*  Lydia xy brown writes I as an autistic person who doesn't instinctually or innately flap my hands or arms
*  It was never a stem that I developed independently
*  Will deliberately and frequently choose to flap especially in public in order to call attention to myself
*  So that other people whether autistic or not might identify me as autistic. It's like this stuff is that that's a scholar. I
*  Mean we should actually talk about freaking auto ethnography man. It's like it's a diary entry that propents to be sociology
*  It's so strange it's
*  Okay, I get it, okay, okay, so I mean
*  This is how is that gonna help disabled people? It's not if disabled
*  What is disability studies for right right? How's that gonna help anybody then also?
*  Acting you're acting
*  Also acting your act like what if I
*  What if I decided I self-diagnosed myself even though I'm a comedian
*  I say a lot of words
*  I probably shouldn't say in polite company, but I say them all the time
*  Yeah, what if I self-diagnosed myself as having Tourette's and so that when I'm out in public. I just go cut cut
*  I just I go and I just like force myself to do it so that people recognize that I have Tourette's well
*  You know they were to cue
*  It must be like
*  If you could come up with a funny premise South Park or as an episode on it
*  I wonder what would happen actually I mean I'm pretty good at figuring out what theory would do
*  What if somebody genuinely did have Tourette's and then part of their tick worked out to be that they said racial slurs
*  Oh my god like is that like is that like subconscious racism baked into him like what would happen?
*  I don't actually know what would happen in that. Yeah
*  Jesus Christ yeah, I'd be baked in there's like systemic race
*  There's like no resolution Cartman stress
*  Cartman pretends to have Tourette's syndrome so that he could say whatever he wants without getting in trouble
*  And if I think I remember this now it eventually leads
*  To trouble and he ends up saying things he would never say
*  The episode's title is a play on the title of John Luke Goddard's 1963 film Le Petit Soldat
*  That's funny. Is that sold out or sold a I don't speak French. I don't even know
*  I remembered something of this the other day
*  2007 dude yeah, they're so ahead of the curve. They were so tapped into this stuff
*  Well, if anybody is going to attack woke culture successfully it will be South Park
*  It will be comedians in general yes, but that's in particular because they have these characters that they could speak through
*  That's right these characters don't really resemble people so you can murder them. I could kill them off
*  Yeah, like Kenny yeah, and they they have this amazing leeway
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean that's what it's gonna have to be it's gonna have to be I mean
*  So that's what I tried to do
*  I'm trying to lay down the the tracks so that people feel like they can actually get into this well
*  I think through what you and Peter and Helen have done through these hoax studies
*  You've at least highlighted to many people that not only is this a real problem
*  But it's really hilarious
*  How right far they're willing to go and accepts what kind of nonsense you guys are pushing exactly and?
*  Like now it's like taking over everything so like
*  You know right what do you do?
*  What do you do because it seems like is there gonna be a peak and we're gonna hit peak woke
*  So it's gonna slide to normalcy. I don't know
*  Societally, but I actually wrote an article
*  I put on new discourses the other day that I said that we people need to be having conversations right now
*  because I'm like kind of getting disowned by friends and family a little bit and
*  The question that I think people need to be asking is where's the line?
*  Like because the way people reason is that they'll let themselves slide and then justify it they call it poke post hoc rationalization
*  That's John Hyde's term and they'll let themselves slide and then justify it
*  But if they state their principles up front because I don't think a lot of people have actually
*  Done that and say you know, okay. I've already defended riots, but let's say that they fire
*  You know all of the department heads or whatever at a university or they fire this or they you know burn that down or whatever
*  It is some everybody should have a line that says okay
*  Wait, this is too far
*  And I think individuals need to start figuring out what theirs were so they can tell the story if they've already had it like you
*  And I've already had that and then other people who haven't like you know
*  We need to be talking to our friends and say, you know
*  I get that you think the woke movement is important and that it's doing good things and
*  You know, there's some crazy stuff going on and I'm stressed about it
*  Where do you where do you feel like the line is?
*  Where do you where do you draw the line and say it's gone too far and you don't even it's not about getting the answer
*  It's actually about getting them to think about it. What's happened so quickly?
*  very quick and the changes are so
*  Radical and what's acceptable and not acceptable and what people are willing to do to people that don't toe the line and that it's insane
*  Yeah, I mean utter destruction of life and people who I mean you're seeing immigrant stories
*  I'm getting emails from people who's like marriages like interracial marriages are breaking up and they're like how do I save my husband?
*  Well the all lives matter
*  Firing thing is just one of the craziest ones like you can't say all like if someone says
*  What do you feel about black lives matter and then you say all lives matter?
*  You get fired from your job. No, but you know
*  It's it's one of those things where you're being like obviously all lives matter
*  Obviously, right but also obviously black lives matter. So why are you so compelled to follow the narrative?
*  That if you say something that's obviously true
*  Instead of following the narrative you get fired so because of that people are willfully
*  Self-censoring and they're changing their perspective on things because they don't want to be canceled and they want to be fired
*  Right. So the question for me is like how much of that do you have to see before you start saying something has gone awry?
*  Yeah, something's off. This isn't normal, right? This isn't how we do business
*  You know, I keep finding myself saying, you know, you know, I'm on the left really
*  Don't I don't really get on with conservative stuff and I'm not really like
*  Patriotic like, you know gets and I keep saying myself as like the United States of America. Why is this happening here?
*  You know tapping everywhere though. Why it is everywhere. At least it speaks English and I think Spanish now. Yeah. Yeah
*  Where's this go?
*  You're you're smart guy. Where's this go? We're in a math. We're a highly nonlinear situation
*  So it's not actually clear because it depends on a lot of factors like if we have another
*  Police brutality incident against black people in the near term. That's gonna be a mess. Yeah, it's gonna be a huge mess
*  it's so hard to tell because it's like
*  Trump is the irritant that's driving every like Trump derangement thing is part of what's happening
*  Everybody's driven crazy like properly people are actually driven crazy by this. So what happens with the election tells us a lot
*  I tend to be
*  optimistic in the sense that this
*  Movement is so internally contradictory. So you got like I mentioned the trans and queer stuff
*  That's on the Black Lives Matter official about page. So there's another hashtag that's
*  Trans black black trans lives matter. And so it's like is there an all black lives matter, you know, is that okay to say?
*  Because it's the same dynamic but all of a sudden you can't say all lives matter in answer to black lives matter
*  But can you say all black lives matter and we're interested black trans lives matter
*  And so it's like it's internally contradictory
*  right and then people are actually kind of catching on that something is not fair like the white fragility game is just
*  Bullshit, you just can't get around it. The systemic thing is is something feels unfair about it and
*  Everybody being complicit in racism seems, you know a bit much
*  So there's all these kind of internal contradictions and there's gonna be these inside fights
*  And so it's hard to say that it's gonna like take over on the other hand
*  We're in the closest thing that we've seen in a long time to the Chinese Cultural Revolution
*  But they did struggle sessions. That's these cancel sessions
*  They made people do tearful apologies and make these they weren't videos
*  It was like China in the 60s
*  But they you know put them on public a stool in public yelled at him and humiliated him and made him wear a hat with
*  you know, like duns hat or whatever and
*  That's what these cancel sessions these they're actually the same thing as struggle sessions. They're just having on social media
*  It's also signaling to all the other people that haven't been in trouble that this will happen to you
*  Right if you do not comply and there's some psychological stuff, you know, they say, you know, is there a fate worse than death?
*  there's some psychological stuff that's floating around out there that says that being completely ostracized from your group and being unable to feel like a
*  good person in your society is
*  So psychologically damaging that it might actually be worse worse than death
*  And so you that's what people are faced with and they're so afraid of it
*  Which is so bad because it's just so transparently bogus and they can't defend itself all it does is call names
*  So it's hard to say where it'll go I actually think it will
*  My prognosis is that it will break itself
*  break itself it will just
*  The backlash to it which can be reasonable and liberal people are gonna wake up and they're gonna have peak woke and they're not gonna have
*  More woke and it will chew itself up from the inside with these fights between us
*  Here's an example of a fight. Here's an example fight 1619 project from the New York Times
*  Nicole Hannah Jones writes this
*  you know kind of fake history of the United States saying that we're all about slavery slavery is everything to do the United States in every
*  regard from the beginning and still and then
*  What are they doing now?
*  right
*  so there's this huge intense fight between the
*  Black population and the indigenous population for most racially oppressed and they both have a pretty good claim on it, right?
*  So that genocide thing was pretty pretty big and then slavery was pretty big and it's complicated
*  So they're gonna they're fighting for status. So you had the indigenous side of that
*  assert that black people in North America are settlers of color
*  Which is a problem and then you've had Nicole Hannah Jones try to point out that lots of Native Americans held black slaves
*  Which so there were slave owners, which is a problem
*  So they're fighting over that in fighting for status for the ultimate victim status and then they've got like that trans things coming
*  I saw a video of some black woman the other day yelling about what is this?
*  Black power fist on the trans flag about that's not you know, that's not this is supposed to be a black people
*  So we have white people trans white people putting their stuff
*  I thought it was really clever that trans people jumped in and had that black trans lives matter
*  Rally right right because it was like you you might be the only people they can get away with this right now
*  This is a thing no one else can hop in on that
*  But black trans lives matter and there was like hundreds of thousands of people because everybody felt like you had to just keep keep protesting
*  Yeah, exactly. So I think it's gonna chew itself up inside but everything that took over is going with it
*  Like the the I don't know how long is gonna take the university to not be kind of like I don't know about that anymore
*  Well, yeah, when do they say anything like that
*  Particularly if they get so much massive pushback from the people that they're you know, they're teaching
*  Right. I mean the number of people right now that are saying they want deferrals partly because of the kovat and online classes
*  They don't want to go back to college
*  Yeah, and then this stuff's blown out and every college president's like we're gonna be a full anti racist thing
*  The other thing nobody's factoring in yet is the other backlash which is gonna be law
*  Okay
*  Niagara Falls of lawsuits is coming because a bunch of people are so here's here like imagine you run a business you do run a
*  business so all of a sudden
*  You know this event happens. Everybody's supposed to have their statement
*  There's tons of social pressure to make your statement if you don't make a statement
*  It's compelled, you know say oh your business didn't say something about black lives matter
*  So you have to say something one way or the other
*  So everybody's making a statement everybody's trying to do the thing and they don't know what to do
*  So I hear from a lot of people that email me about
*  The at their job what they're they talk to their boss and the boss is like well we have to do something and there's this
*  You know, there's this program this anti racism program
*  So we have to do something and that's the thing and we'll just take it up and a lot of people are successfully pushing back
*  On that and saying look there are other ways
*  We can actually do other diversity programs than this one and when they realize that you know
*  A lot of bosses are saying huh? Yeah, maybe we should think a little harder about this
*  So everybody's acting really fast and
*  There's a clear moral panic going on so people are making bad decisions and they're opening themselves up to a lot of future litigation
*  like if you're actually having an official statement or policy of your company that says something like
*  That you believe that all white people are complicit in racism or are racists and you've now called all your white employees racist
*  That's not good. That's probably discriminatory
*  Do you think you can actually sue someone for that my point isn't whether or not you can my point is that a lot of
*  People are going to try but I think that the courts are even siding towards being more woke because it's society's
*  Cultural shifts some yes direction some yes and some no and that's there's a point to that
*  But on the other hand for example, if you look at the title nine cases where those mostly boys
*  But it wasn't always boys got totally railroaded in kangaroo courts. They got accused of sexual misconduct
*  The university ends up expelling them or whatever, you know that girl with a mattress or whatever happened
*  And then they're suing in civil court and they're almost all winning. Is that did that kid the mattress boy?
*  Did he sue I don't know if he did specifically or not
*  But I do know that there have been a number of civil suits that lady was bringing her mattress on the stage when she accepted her
*  Her diploma. I mean it's performance art. Yeah, it's just performance art
*  It's it's really like we can't run the world on performance art though
*  Yeah
*  What's really strange too is that if you accuse someone of something and it turns out that not be true
*  You don't really get in trouble for that
*  That's that's thing. That's a real problem. That's a thing because there's no actual
*  repercussions for being deceptive and ruining someone's life. I have a friend who was accused of
*  Sexual assault by a woman and it was proven that he didn't do it and nothing ever happened
*  All right, that's that's you see made some stuff up about him
*  And so we got laws against revenge porn, right?
*  Yeah
*  You can't like film your girlfriend or whatever and then you break up and then you put it on our internet put her on the internet
*  To put her on blast or embarrass or whatever it's against the law now. We made laws about that
*  I mean this doxxing stuff or these videos where they're filming people and accusing of being a racist and it blows up their lives
*  Like there may have to be legislation built around that so the question becomes
*  Will the political will be there and that depends on the people and it depends on the politicians
*  I know your lovely state here of California
*  Just the state legislature just voted to take the anti-discrimination language out of the state constitution, which I think is a bold move
*  I think the people get to decide on that in the end and maybe November
*  But what is the anti-discrimination language in the Constitution that they're removing?
*  Yeah, you're gonna pull that one up it's like article 31 or something like that it is
*  Unbelievable that they voted to put this up to be pulled out of the Constitution. What what was there?
*  It's like you can't discriminate or favor by race
*  Gender sex sexual orientation so on and so forth
*  Why would they remove that because equity requires discrimination if you listen to this guy that's blasting all over Ibram Kendi
*  How to be anti-racist even has a sentence in the book where he says that you have to evaluate everything according to whether it has
*  racist or anti-racist outcomes, so if you have
*  Discrimination policy that says you cannot discriminate and then that makes it so you don't have equity then that's actually a racist policy
*  So they're actually advocate. I mean equity requires getting discrimination, correct, but it'll be positive discriminate
*  Well, it might actually discrimination against white males. It'll be discrimination for at first
*  discrimination for minorities so the equivalent of affirmative action and reparations and then they'll add in
*  Possibly discrimination against if they aren't achieving what they're trying to is this clear that this is their motivations
*  Is I mean they're they don't lie about it
*  They just say it all the time is that if it's if you don't have equal outcomes, then the system must be I mean
*  You can see how this is like putting like, you know wallpaper over a hole in your wall
*  If the system has unequal outcomes, it must be discrimination
*  So you're just gonna gonna change the policies to make up for it and
*  That I mean they say it explicitly and you see this that there have been actually all there's a lawsuit at least one lawsuit
*  One in New York City where they were openly discriminating against Asian students
*  Like they were they were discriminating against Asians to make it because they're you know, they're academically kicking all the ass and so
*  They were making it more difficult for they would have to have had a higher GPA right to get in. Yeah
*  What where's going what's going on with that Harvard? There's a lawsuit with Harvard with that, right?
*  I don't know where it's out though. Yeah, that is that's
*  Troubling this this is troubling stuff. Yeah, and I mean I say California does this
*  I don't know what happens because it's in violation of the federal laws
*  So, I mean it's directly against the title seven who's pushing for that
*  Who's I mean all of these kind of like hustlers that are getting all famous are pushing for it
*  But then I again as your state legislature actually voted amongst themselves to put it up to a vote
*  All the more reason to move to Texas or something. Yeah, it's so spooky. It's like where do they think this shit goes?
*  It's like there's no map of the territory
*  there's no like if we do this then you know, we're gonna have this kind of success in the future because you know,
*  we'll we'll discriminate to the point where we reach some sort of
*  Homeostasis, I mean some equality there's some there are some scary judge ruled for Harvard
*  Wow
*  Their website hmm, so that ruling was the last October, okay
*  interesting
*  politically motivated lawsuit brought by Edward Blum the organization
*  He created students for the fair admissions wants to remove the consideration of race in college and university admissions
*  What's at stake the ability of colleges and universities across the country to create the diverse communities?
*  essential to their educational missions and the success of their students
*  So the problem was that so many of these Asian kids were doing so well
*  They had a disproportionate number of Asian students and they wanted to balance it out better
*  They want more blacks and Latinos specifically. They usually say it at least in New York City
*  They they actually say it that it's blacks and Latinos
*  I say it over and over and over again that Asians and whites and Jews are filling all the spots and
*  Blacks and Latinos aren't so what you're actually looking at is they're trying to move to a space where they can put racial quotas in
*  That's so crazy and it hurts people right? So if you take a like with Harvard Harvard's hard
*  It's a hard school. So if you take somebody who's academically not prepared for Harvard and you stick them in Harvard
*  They're going to underperform and then
*  If you would have stuck them in a school that they actually are, you know, it matches their their capabilities, then they're gonna excel
*  That's how it works
*  You can't like if you if we went out into the gym and we put some weights on there, right?
*  And you're like, all right Jimmy gonna bench 400 pounds. I'm like, no, I'm not
*  But it's like, you know, you wanted to coach me you would say alright
*  We found out you can do like 190 or whatever. So we're gonna push yourself. We're gonna try 195
*  You know within that little bit of a range you can call somebody to excel and then within however many months or years
*  I'm benching three four hundred pounds
*  You you can't just put people in hard mode and then watch them succeed and then again I get these emails from people
*  They're telling me their story
*  I get this one from this black guy who said that he never had any of his work
*  Corrected and how does he know in his master's program? How does he know?
*  How does he know in his master's program?
*  So he started deliberately putting mistakes in to see if they'd correct it and they wouldn't they didn't correct it
*  Like he was putting mistakes in on purpose, right?
*  So he's getting A's on all these papers that he was writing that were just junk and now we can't get a job
*  Because his skills never developed to the point where they're actually competitive
*  So it's like trying to help people by the wrong means hurts them. Well, they don't care about the end result, right?
*  They don't care about you getting a job. They really just care about you graduating and looking good on there
*  It's like I said, it's like putting wallpaper over a hole in the wall and considering it fixed
*  it's like oh, we're just gonna fix the numbers on the back end and
*  Problem solved, you know, but if Harvard really wanted to make things equal they would try to figure out why they're not
*  Based on you know
*  Like if they have only X amount of white people and X amount of Asian
*  But like why why are there less of this race nationality than the other exactly?
*  And let's let's put some study into what can be done and use all these brilliant minds
*  Figure out what can be done to make this better. So that's the difference between critical theory and traditional theory
*  So you're saying we should do traditional theory, which every reasonable person in the world now knows and they don't want to
*  Let me give you an idea like this systemic thing
*  Makes that impossible. So
*  Imagine I'll give you an analogy that helps you understand what systemic say racism systemic what this idea really means
*  So imagine like you and I go out for a walk down the sidewalk, right and for whatever reason
*  You step on you know
*  The back end of a broken bottle and you trip and you bump into me and you knock me into the road
*  When you trip and I happen to get by a car
*  And I die
*  Okay, so whose fault was that? Obviously usually we'd probably say like no fault or whatever
*  But if you start looking at it the way that these scholars do and this is actually tracking the same argument
*  That's in the book being white being good by Barbara Applebaum about white complicity. What happens is you could say well
*  You it's your fault for tripping and it's my fault for deciding to walk on the street side versus the the inside and
*  Walking right next to you instead of slightly in front of you
*  It's a person who drove the car's fault for you know, maybe they were speeding
*  Maybe maybe they happened to have chose to go at that time
*  Maybe the doctor called and they had to run out of the house
*  So the doctors now got some complicity and in the situation
*  The kid who broke the bottle last night after he had a couple of beers. Well, it's his fault
*  So he's complicit
*  But then if you go all the way to this systemic understanding where you're just looking at the back end the wallpaper
*  Over the hole in the wall. It would be saying well, we live in a culture where people drive cars and drink beer
*  We live in a culture that supports cars and beer
*  Everybody that supports car culture everybody who supports the economy that that allows people to afford cars
*  Everybody who supports the culture that would allow beer to exist is also somehow complicit
*  That's actually the same argument that the white complicity and racism book makes
*  Everybody car culture is to blame for me getting hit by that car
*  And so you can see it makes it impossible to figure out where moral responsibility
*  Actually lies because it puts it on everybody and it makes it impossible to see what the actual causes are another story I had
*  From similar to this was from University of Michigan. There's this program called stride and it's supposed to fix for these disparities
*  So I'm talking to somebody and he's talking about hiring academic hiring and he says, okay
*  The way the stride paper the stride program looks at it for whatever reason men have twice as many of this as women
*  Whatever the thing is and so stride says okay
*  So if a woman applies you count the number if a man and a woman apply you count the number the man has
*  You double the number the women have and I said hang on a second. Wait a minute
*  Do you know why that number is different? He said no
*  Nobody knows why it's different. It just is so we're just gonna double and I said but some of that might be
*  Discrimination and some of it might not and I would agree with you that we should consider making up for the part that is discrimination
*  So maybe it's half of that is discrimination
*  So you add of something but you don't double it because some of it might be something different and you don't know and he was
*  Like well, what else could it be?
*  Right. So this systemic thinking
*  Prevents you from being able to start thinking of what the real causes the real problems are
*  So it's again, it's fixing your your hole in your wall by just like let's just put up some wallpaper, you know
*  But systemic thinking right now is very popular. It's so hot. It's everything
*  Yes, they love saying it too because it sounds good and it's religious. I mean, it's a spiritual thing, right? Yeah
*  There's a system it works in mysterious ways
*  And it does in a lot of ways it works I mean this comes back to if we look at the book
*  Michelle Foucault's philosophy power and
*  Politics work through everybody constantly by the way that we speak about things by the way that we think about things
*  So you have this kind of like vague mystical sense of how society works is that it's operating through everybody and everybody's complicit and tied into it
*  Well, I don't have a problem with them being wrong
*  We have a problem with but but I do have a problem that this stuff can't be questioned
*  Right and that if you even bring it up you get insulted and you know, you're probably gonna get attacked now
*  That's right
*  You know what else I have a problem with is that they come in and they sell you something like anti-racism or diversity
*  Or inclusion or equity and they don't tell you really what it means. It just sounds good
*  Right, and so that's why I'm writing that encyclopedia
*  My opinion, you know
*  I am a firm believer that people should be able to believe what they want that you will within not
*  Injuring people or whatever, you know do what they want
*  You should really we should have freedom a lot of freedom and so I
*  think that people though should be able to
*  Know what they're signing up for and this language is so tricky
*  They've really engineered the language to be so tricky that people think oh anti-racism. That sounds really good
*  So let's do it and it actually like the definition of it is a lifelong commitment to self-reflection self-critique and social activism. It's ongoing and
*  No one has ever done. That's actually the definition
*  Isn't that kind of what's wrong with a lot of this woke shit is that we're monkeying around with definitions and language
*  We're changing we're changing language
*  We're screwing with what things actually mean to the point where everything gets very vague and confusing and to challenge it
*  That's right. You're ostracized. That's right. Everything like when you hear like
*  Like Antifa talk about fascism. Everybody's a fascist. Everybody's a Nazi
*  What they actually like if you dig in and figure out what the word fascism means it actually means a functioning society
*  Because it has to have like police it has to have order it has to have
*  You know an economy that functions it means not anarchy
*  Because anything that could lead to a total fascist state
*  Equals fascism in the present according to the way you think about it that comes again from that Herbert Marcuse a guy who wrote this
*  They wrote it explicitly in
*  Repressive tolerance in 1965 we live in a perpetual state of emergency now that fascism has entered the world
*  So everything that could produce fascism is fascism
*  And it's like that. I'm sorry, man. That's that's fucking lunatic. It's just not real what yeah
*  But how does this get corrected if you can't criticize it?
*  That's the real issue, right?
*  If it's if it's happening at the university level, but it's not being questioned at the university level
*  There's no real debate. So how does this ever get corrected?
*  It seems like it has to get out into the world and then by then the fire is so big
*  There's not enough hoses to put it out. That's right. That's actually kind of the the way this has worked
*  Is it they've got so many people thinking this way. It's hard to put the fires out, but
*  The answer is not going to be very palatable the name-calling has to lose its credit
*  Not all the way to some degree
*  So like you and I were talking about earlier was it feminism was it black lives matter if somebody calls me a racist
*  I don't freak out. I stay calm and I say what do you mean by that?
*  Right, and so it just they say oh well systems blah blah blah. No
*  I'm not I'm I mean this their definitions that say things like there's there's only racist and anti-racist
*  There's no such thing as not racist like screw you. I'm not racist. Just that is crazy
*  Just move on like so when did anti-racist rear its head that seems a fairly new expression
*  But it's getting tossed around like a beach ball at a concert. It became big just like
*  Big just in the last few years off of a couple of these authors like Ibram Kendi and Robin D'Angelo
*  Who dedicate a lot of their work to it D'Angelo's book that's relevant was 2018 and
*  Kendi's was I think that think I have to check 2019 for his how to be an anti-racist
*  He has the same lady that wrote the white fragility that is white fragility. I'm talking about. Yeah, that is from 18
*  I mean she has other yes 2018. She has other books that are even crazier. Like what does it mean to be white? Oh
*  So she's a hustler. She's a big-time hustler. She has this paper
*  I actually found somebody sent it to me the other day
*  This is a real paper and it's called something about the racial cray cray
*  white neurosis and the racial cray cray from 2013 like
*  You can find if you google that name
*  The racial racial cray cray people nobody believed like it's the most one of the most insane things I've ever read
*  It's got these sections like in the paper, you know introduction or whatever and then at the beginning of each one
*  It's like they just make something up like this weird rant and then that ends in a poem and
*  It says that that white people in white supremacy cause a racial cray cray in white people and then white racial cray cray causes
*  Other people to have to live with racial cray cray, so they get racial cray cray, too
*  I'm not making that up. That's that's real white supremacy
*  You know, there's another one that gets getting chucked around quite a bit. It's because they've changed the definition
*  Yeah, you know what? You know what some things and so I'm gonna gonna point out
*  This is actually from a
*  Legislative body sorry an administrative body set up by the state legislature of Washington in January called its equity tax task force
*  And you know what they said was white supremacy coming through their mouths as they they said it
*  keeping a meeting agenda
*  staying on a schedule
*  there's a
*  2017 paper by Alison Bailey that talks about those specific things those specific things keeping a meeting schedule
*  Yes a schedule and agenda
*  So there's actually something that I read a year or so ago because of the schedule thing that wearing a wristwatch
*  Because that means you care about time and being on time is white supremacy
*  White supremacy is believing that the society that white people created which means science reason logic civility rule of law
*  democracy
*  That that's good. That's the definition of white supremacy. So somebody calls me white supremacist
*  Once you know that it's not all white society isn't that Egyptian as well?
*  I mean not the way they think about it
*  All they care about is the way that the the white Western men following the enlightenment
*  Started to use this to oppress people. Oh god
*  That's what watch is white supremacy watch is a white supremacy
*  So this Alison Bailey woman has this paper
*  Where she literally the point of the papers to say anything that disagrees as a manager
*  Anything that disagrees is somebody just trying to keep their privilege as she calls it privilege preserving epistemic pushback. That's a real term
*  And so in the paper though, she says that the Masters tools in philosophy, which are
*  That's slavery, right? That's white supremacy. The Masters tools that maintain white supremacy are
*  like philosophical soundness
*  Epistemic adequacy, which means knowing what you're talking about
*  Science reason like that's what they think white supremacy is science is white supremacy
*  That's why you have to now have to redo chemistry and make chemistry woke because and this is being taught in schools
*  So people are paying money to learn this correct and that legislative entity in Washington their equity task force
*  They defined equity like you when I say equity you probably have you know
*  What do you think you think something like equality something different a little bit something but you have that vague sense of equality
*  They said it equals disrupt plus dismantle
*  Tear down the system and then they also said the point of this body is to set this up that was their official
*  Definition by the way, and the point of this body is to establish this
*  administrative entity for 50 years for the state of Washington
*  Dude I'm telling you I was like I've been like I'll tell you the truth
*  Since these riots broke out. I've actually been much calmer for about the last six to eight months. I've been literally
*  Having my right eyelid twitch like constantly
*  Like constantly all the time even had it twitching in my sleep to where the muscle that causes your eyelid to like flutter got cramps
*  That sucked. What do you think that's from?
*  It was from knowing that this shit was happening and nobody having any way to see it and I was trying to write this website
*  As fast as I could I wrote like 200,000 words on new discourses from Christmas told like the riots broke out
*  It's like I'm trying to tell the world about this at least more people are listening
*  That's what I'm very hopeful about
*  It was a thing that you were talking about a few years ago and people are like why are you wasting your time on this nonsense?
*  This will never be a factor in the real world incorrect
*  incorrect
*  Incorrect. Yeah, that's why we started writing this book. It was to explain that to people because we were getting gaslit
*  I mean we were getting told by philosophers that we just didn't know what we were talking about
*  And then Helen wasn't gonna have that and she was like, I'll just write a book and tell them
*  Helen's our machine gunner man. I need to meet her. Oh, she can't she can't come over here from the UK, right?
*  Not now. Not with these viruses and stuff. Back then she couldn't when we did our first podcast together
*  That's right. She could if like, you know, the virus and health and stuff can get associated. Yeah, I hope it clears up
*  She's the most perfectly principled and clear person I think I've ever worked with. She's a marvel
*  That's a hell of a statement. Yeah
*  Yeah, well she said that I'm the least sexist person she's ever worked with which I think is also pretty good congratulations
*  Yeah, what'd you do to purge your obvious innate? I
*  Just treat people's ideas as ideas
*  So the reason she said that was because I didn't like there's a thing called benevolent sexism where you're too nice to women
*  And I just don't do it. Oh
*  Benevolent sexism
*  Interesting. Well, you hold doors open and shit like that. Correct. You piece of shit. She could hold the door open herself
*  Yeah, well, I mean what about if you hold doors open for men only I mean then you seem like a sexist too
*  That's right. Double-bind
*  You're damned if you do you're double fucked there, right? That's right
*  So you have to see like you have to see set see race
*  But if you see race you're racist, right?
*  Because if you say I'm only holding doors open for men like what kind of piece of shit sexist to you exactly
*  No, I'm not a sexist. So I don't hold doors open for women because they could do it themselves
*  So here's Helen's example of a perfect double bind but it's race it's not sex but it could work exactly the same
*  she says imagine she have a store and a
*  shopkeepers there and a black customer and a white customer both in store at the same time and the shopkeepers like goes up to help
*  One person first. So if they go and this is what critical race theory. This is how would analyze what happens
*  So if she if the shopkeeper goes to the white person first, it would say that's clear racism white favoritism and
*  Make the black person wait
*  But if it went to the black person first, they would say it's clear racism because she wanted to get the black person out of the store
*  faster
*  Oh boy, that's literally how critical race theory would operate with that because one of the do
*  well one of the tenets of critical race theory is that racism is ordinary not aberrational in the United States society and
*  It is not the question is no longer
*  Did racism take place?
*  For that is to be assumed but rather
*  How did racism manifest in that situation? So there I mean that's that quoted Robert de Angelo for that
*  So that the belief is that racism is in literally every every interaction and it's up to the critical race theorist
*  That's the critical race theorist job is to find it even if you have to make it up like master bedroom
*  God I think the master bedroom thing was voluntary. I think someone just in that business
*  Said we probably should it blew up on Twitter about a month ago because I live on Twitter as you know
*  I've like basically like neo'd into the the Twitter matrix and I take days off
*  Yeah, no, I mean not really lately because it's like if my mileage of twitching because the world's gonna end man
*  What are you gonna do? But if you know, you know like
*  Mike the filmmaker came to visit and like we went hiking and stuff and it was a days off
*  You know, we were talking about this stuff, but we were out in the woods and you know doing normal stuff
*  I try to get out. I mean with the pandemic it didn't I don't really but I try to get out like usually
*  I have my trip to China every year and two weeks and it's just you know, no work
*  So some but not much especially right now man
*  It's like it's not good to be like one of the few people who's actually know like I'm watching the train
*  Like wrecking and everybody's like what's happening?
*  That's the thing is that you're willing to call it for what it is, which is a very dangerous game right now
*  That's right. It's a very dangerous game because most people don't want to hear that
*  I can do it because I actually know what I'm talking about
*  So when they come back at me I quote their own literature at them and usually they don't know their literature as well as I do
*  Because I've read all this crap. I read a lot of it over and over again. I've read D Angelo's book twice
*  I've read, you know, it's a heavy burden. You've got in your head. Oh, dude. It's not it's not a good place
*  I mean, I keep telling to tell people people like oh you're a grifter. You're trying to both
*  No, it's actually I want to make myself irrelevant by making this go away and then I want to retire
*  That's it. That's all I want in life that grifter term gets used really
*  inappropriately all the time
*  Anybody doesn't disagree with someone is a grifter
*  Particularly if you disagree with someone who has a right-wing philosophy or excuse me a left-wing philosophy
*  You don't have to make money to be a grifter. I made zero dollars for the vast majority of the time
*  I make a little on patreon now
*  So I can't say it anymore
*  But I made zero dollars for the majority of the time that I've done this and people are calling me a grifter
*  because I was getting Twitter followers like Twitter followers are somehow like
*  Value or something. There's some value to it
*  I mean you can monetize a little bit or you can like, you know
*  I guess I could put my dark plans and I don't I don't even know what our plans
*  No, my whole thing is like I don't want to tell people what to do
*  Right, like all these people come to me. I don't want people telling you what to do
*  I see that they're doing this correct. And so it's like people come to me and they're like, how do I live and I'm like man
*  I will tell you the truth. I actually think I have a pretty good handle on how I live
*  But I don't know your circumstances. I don't know how I don't know your story
*  So I don't know how to tell you what to I know some principles or some good. I'm real big on authenticity
*  Real big on authenticity. I actually should write something about authenticity that is clear and accessible for people
*  I think people should be authentic. I think you should take the time to learn who you are
*  Mmm, take the time. It's not easy. It's not easy and it's best done through struggle. That's right
*  And it is it is you have to go wrestle up against some stuff
*  You have to be told where you're failing you have to be told where you suck. Yeah, you have to have a discipline, right?
*  Usually there's something about doing a thing that lets you know who you are
*  I mean, it's not for everybody so I can't say it but the martial arts have been great for that for me and they have been
*  For you. Yeah, it works for a lot of people some people I mean you don't have to do that though running yoga anything
*  I find find a discipline and it's really so push yourself when you push yourself you find out
*  You find out where you're gonna quit you find out your shortcomings you find out where you're you're you know
*  Where your demons are where the skeletons are in your head? That's right
*  And you know ideally it needs to be something that bounces off a reality
*  Yeah, right
*  You can't like if it's just going in reading and writing stuff
*  That's how you like you can go pretty far out into La La Land, right?
*  So you need to bounce off bounce it off reality
*  I used to say that philosophers need I used to work a lot in my garden and I would say that I'm suck at gardening
*  By the way, but philosophers need to get their hands in the soil because you can't lie about it. You feel it
*  You smell it. It's heavy. I'm from Tennessee. So it's like sticky clay
*  You can't get it off you and it's like in that earth smell is that and it's like wet
*  And it's like it's real and you're sweating and it's like, you know, you can't reality won't lie to you, right?
*  and that's where this is so like
*  my my answer to this problem is we need to remember that objective principles work and that we need to defer to
*  Reality not lying to us because we can lie to ourselves all day
*  We can lie to ourselves and say that Fallon Fox is exactly the same as the people she's whose heads she'd literally beat in
*  And then went on Twitter and bragged about how it was fun to crack that person's skull
*  Yeah, like that she derived enjoyment from that week
*  You can you can you can go on that you can go on tumblr or Twitter and deconstruct your identity and become a completely different person
*  but
*  Reality doesn't lie to you. It never lies to you, right?
*  The only thing that lies is your lived experience your interpretation of your lived experience of reality
*  So I think that people need to do that, you know do something hard try to build a thing and when it falls down
*  Because it will try again
*  Like I tried getting into blacksmithing for a little while a year or so ago. I made a couple little knives
*  Like really little knives because I only had a little tiny forge
*  So they're like really little like embarrassingly little but it's just fooling around, you know, but the steel doesn't lie
*  And when you drop the steel like I did one time and it's yellow it whatever it touches catches on fire
*  And that doesn't lie either, right? So it's like you have to I think people need more reality like they need to unplug
*  Yeah, isn't that is a that's a problem with just thinking right just thinking and then also
*  Expanding expounding upon those thoughts in front of other people that are also just thinking and you're all doing it together
*  Is that there's like you need some sort of a tangible physical discipline to go along with that right that's sort of
*  Tempers you that's I think that's exactly right and something that's you know
*  A long practice that makes like yoga or martial arts or running to like get good at it
*  Mm-hmm, that's really great because you know, you're gonna have pitfalls and you're gonna have to learn to struggle and overcome
*  You're gonna develop a little bit of stoicism is gonna come with just to get through. Yeah, you have to yeah
*  You have to because it I mean
*  You know
*  I've had
*  matches before where I went on and I was all hot shot or whatever back when I used to do sport karate and some dude just
*  Kick me in the side of the head and I was like unconscious and that's just the end of that, you know
*  And it's like you got to reassess your cockiness real fast. Yes, once you get your your your
*  Head kicked so hard you get knocked out. Like I didn't see the kick. I just woke up later, you know, so it's like
*  Something like that where you're gonna have these pitfalls or like I had when I was learning the martial arts
*  I trained now
*  I had a really long period of time where what we called it was a knowledge use gap
*  Like I could do the forms or whatever I could practice the techniques and I could do them what looked to be accurate
*  I want to try to do them on a person that didn't work
*  Right until it works on a person. It doesn't work. Right, right
*  I even said this on Twitter this morning is I think we need to have an ethic in the like our culture needs to start
*  Remembering an ethic that your education whether it's you know
*  school or whether it's
*  You know training or whatever it is is worth what you can build with it
*  It's not worth anything more than what you can build
*  So if you go to like trade school and you end up building some great business empire
*  Your education was good
*  And if you go to university and get a PhD and do a couple postdocs and all you can do is
*  Wine and complain and you can't do anything productive your education wasn't good
*  And it doesn't see you immediately remove like these weird elite credentialing things from that
*  It's what can you do with it that proves whether or not it was good in the world
*  I think we need to kind of remember it's like a pragmatic thing, right?
*  What can you do with this?
*  Right and some people that can only teach the same thing that they learned
*  Right and that becomes a problem because then you're so indoctrinated in the system and you just sort of perpetuating the same shit
*  Got you to where you are and just keep making it more and more significant more and more important in terms of the way
*  You describe it to people right?
*  So we look at this this stuff that they're trying to do with like education one of the big movements now is to take
*  Tests out of our schools. Yeah, what's that about? Well, they don't want it. They don't want a test that can show that their stuff failed
*  Mmm, right. They say that's not what they say, but that's what it is
*  They also don't want competition between students exactly
*  They want to they want to do this in particular the test scores don't come out equal across all identity groups
*  Therefore the test must be racist
*  racist towards Asians
*  Apparently, yeah. Yeah, they're the master race when it comes to school
*  Yeah, we all got to practice our Mandarin if this keeps up. Are you do you have hope? I always have hope I am
*  I mean, I am actually
*  Naive Lee optimistic generally. I don't really you know, it's more like this. It's not even that no
*  No, I don't have time for people who are pessimistic whiners
*  Even if this is the fucking end of the world
*  I'm not gonna act like it is I'm not giving up if these people guillotine me in the end and fine
*  But I'm not I see no
*  Value in saying oh, it's hopeless
*  Right. So I'm an atheist we talked about that
*  I mean I would have actually said that last year if I was writing my memoir was finding faith
*  I don't have faith in God didn't happen. Sorry Christian friends
*  Didn't happen but what there there is the ability to have faith in that if you do the work and that if you
*  Get yourself organized and you put your effort in on a program that can actually achieve a result that you can again
*  There's like jujitsu is a really great example. I mean everybody trains jujitsu gets humbled
*  Humbled but the deal is if you go to a qualified jujitsu instructor whether it's a Gracie whether it's you know
*  One of these other there's lots of them now. They're really good
*  They have a program that you can have faith in because it reliably produces black belts who can basically kill everybody
*  Right, and so you can have faith like you're gonna go and for years you're gonna suck. You're gonna get choked out
*  You're gonna get your you know, you're gonna get beat by you're gonna be a purple belt and get choked by a white belt
*  Who got a good move on you at some point? You're gonna have a bad day afterwards
*  It's gonna come up sometimes or some, you know
*  Tricky kid that knows some wrestling is gonna throw you and you're like, how did this happen?
*  It's gonna happen and but if you have faith in that system, then you can also get there
*  So that qualified faith is there and so I actually think that the principles we've laid down for example in our country work
*  This let's defer to the evidence
*  Let's defer to a rule of law knowing that we have a democratic process where we can remake the law as we need to
*  Hopefully incrementally and not through some stupid revolution and then that can work
*  So I have to be hopeful because I know the thing can work
*  If we're willing to kind of stand up for it and remember it
*  I'm hoping that with all this looting and the chaos and the smashing things and the riots and the people shoot
*  like we were talking earlier before the show about this guy who was at a
*  He was at a protest in Provo, Utah and he was just trying to honk his horn and get through and they shot into his car
*  That's madness. It's crazy. That's man. It's crazy and that I'm hoping that this stuff is going to
*  Alarm people to the point where they start recognizing where this is going. That's what I'm saying with peak woke
*  Yeah tearing down like if that's being like for me so much
*  I mean I was already past peak woke bus like a real moment of wake-up call like this
*  You know, there's there've been moments where this stuff has flared up in the past and you're like, oh, it's gonna die down
*  The moment is not this time and what it was was watching the media lie
*  Watching the media defend stuff. That's just not defensible
*  Right and it's like, okay, so this is a thing
*  I don't actually expect your average citizen to like I don't expect people to know a damn thing
*  It's hard life's hard. You go work your ass off you come home. You don't time to learn everything in the universe
*  but
*  With if you have a few of a job in like media or if you're in the government or you're like a college
*  But I expect something out of you, you know, and I think we all have a right to expect something on you
*  So when you have some guy on the media yelling that where does it say anywhere for the protests have to be peaceful
*  It's in the First Amendment, you know, you actually should probably know that I
*  Expect something out of you. So we've got there's a there's actually a crisis
*  We could call it of expertise if you want, but there's a crisis of being able to recognize
*  That people you know
*  Are being held to an expectation of quality and I think the internet has facilitated it
*  I think the the incentives around like hot takes go viral whereas
*  Nuanced analysis doesn't go viral that hot take on where does it say that protests have to be peaceful?
*  Like Jesus Christ, man, what are you talking about? And what who are you pandering to with this? Exactly?
*  That's what I'm talking about. Like it's so but that way he said it was so disingenuous
*  I know you could tell he was just saying it for the reaction
*  Saying it for the fact that at this time people are there's a lot of people that are
*  Interested in stirring shit up and getting getting real change and they think that through these violent protests as long as it's not affecting them
*  Personally through these violent protests some good will result, right? But it's not
*  That's that's not the only way to do it. It's also not in the Constitution. That's right
*  I mean I hear I mean I remember, you know Martin Luther King wrote the thing and he said that the the riots are the voice of
*  Utterly voiceless of the frustrated of the unheard of the unheard. That's right. And I get that man
*  I know he also said he also said that you I don't know
*  I want to I don't want to misquote him so we should probably get the exact quote
*  But there's more to that quote, right? It stops. It doesn't stop there, right? Exactly
*  And I understand like with a cove it did the whole thing
*  I understand that massive frustration and I understand but I expect
*  my
*  Journalists I expect my politicians. I expect my university presidents to be able to make clear
*  Statements that side with civil society and you can even say I recognize that outburst
*  I have knowledge is the outburst anger that they will experience for from people that disagree with them is so much stronger than
*  The support that they were experienced for people that from people that do agree with them
*  That's the problem was a full Martin Luther King quote
*  That
*  But it was it the riot is the voice of the unheard is that what it was
*  There's but there's more to there is where he's talking about. I mean, he's a very nuanced. Yes
*  It's very nice writer, but he's talking about the dangers of speaking of Martin Luther King
*  I actually think you want to know like what's my biggest conspiracy theory? Yes, I
*  Think that the movie Black Panther was a hoax on woke people. What's the movie Black Panther?
*  Do you know the movie Black Panther like the big?
*  Marvel, oh that one. Yeah, that was a hoax. I think so. Oh, come on
*  No, it's a what it's a hoax because first of all, they were all in about it, right?
*  They loved it. Absolutely loved it every they're calling their own stuff. It was a good movie. It was a good movie
*  I liked it. I actually liked that film. So how is it a hoax?
*  Here's it was a hoax on woke people specifically see I'm a master hoaxes of woke people as you will know, right?
*  the story
*  Actually is the an allegory for Martin Luther King versus Malcolm X
*  so King T'Challa is Martin Luther King and
*  Eric the bad guy the fake Black Panther is
*  Malcolm X and he gets in power and he starts changing all the rules and he's you know, there will not be the fight anymore
*  I'm just the king and the whole thing, right?
*  and then what happens is they have the big epic fight at the end and the Martin Luther King side wins and then there's the
*  Morality tale at the end that tells why so I actually think it was a movie
*  That's an allegory that repudiates radicalism in favor of
*  Martin Luther King's
*  Message and then the woke people went nuts for it. Did you find that quote the full quote?
*  Side-tracked with Black Panther. Oh, sorry. It's a good movie. I enjoyed it
*  The part with a car there's I love that
*  There it is
*  But in the final analysis a riot is the language of the unheard and what is it that America has failed to hear it has
*  Failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor
*  I'm not even allowed to say that in this context has worsened over the last few years
*  It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met
*  It has failed to hear that large segments of the white society are more concerned about
*  Tranquility and the status quo than about justice equality and humanity
*  And so in a real sense our nation summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay
*  And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again
*  Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention
*  That's where it gets interesting see I actually agree with that
*  One of the things I've been saying is for all along is that I'm actually against the social justice movement the woke social justice movement
*  Which is formally in the literature called critical social justice
*  I'm against that because I am for social justice actual actual social justice
*  If you want to solve those problems that he's talking about you actually have to understand them
*  You don't put wallpaper over the hole, right? You actually have to understand them. And if you just wallpaper over it, that's the delay
*  Right. Yes, and so you have to understand like what are the actual things contributing to these problems creating these problems?
*  I don't know what the answers are. I don't know what's causing them
*  Maybe some of it is prejudice some of its discrimination some of its cultural
*  Discrimination like not valuing each culture that you know cultural values the same way or whatever
*  It's also the echoes of the suppressive past. I mean how there's that yeah
*  Definitely, you don't just come back from that right, right?
*  What's the most means slavery the slavery took place a hundred and fifty years ago, right that well even more recently
*  You know that they're not wrong to bring up things like redlining and white flight and all these things that economically dispossessed
*  That's within living memory, right? That's I like grandpappies and stuff are yes, that's them
*  Yes, you know
*  So the wealth when they make the argument about accumulated wealth what the average accumulated wealth of a white family versus the average
*  Accumulated wealth of a black family
*  There's something there right and we should expect that there's something there and we should be
*  Trying to understand that and then trying to figure out actual solutions to those problems, right?
*  But like when you take the analysis say of the guy who started critical race theories names Derek Bell first African American
*  Tenured professor at Harvard Harvard law real pessimistic guy
*  He actually said that the point of he said that Brown versus Board of Education which desegregated schools
*  Was done so that white people could feel better about themselves and then it to open up black people to new problems like having to
*  Face discrimination in schools like real pessimistic, but in 1992, okay
*  Get your head on 1992
*  1992 he wrote a book called faces at the bottom of the well
*  And what he said is that black society is the face is the bottom of the well and whites even the he says right in the first
*  Page even the poorest most you know downtrodden awful
*  situation white person
*  Always knows that they can have status by looking down at the face of the bottom of the well, okay
*  I was in 1992. I had like I was impoverishing my parents with Michael Jordan gear, right?
*  I'm not looking down to Michael Jordan in
*  1992
*  Oprah Winfrey Fresh Prince of Bel Air. These were like the things right Dave Chappelle is even doing it
*  Like Oprah Winfrey, I think they're outliers in a sense
*  If you look at like the way the well of course or treats black people in general as an idea
*  But that's not what he said, right?
*  He said that all of black society is the face at the bottom of the well, but he doesn't mean like no
*  That's that's how they get you
*  They do mean what they say. I have to take after reading this stuff for so many years
*  I have to take them at their word and the game that they play is to play off of your they can't really mean that instinct
*  Hmm Derek Bell's held the position that that
*  Desegregating the schools was bad because it just allowed racism to maintain in another direction
*  Derek Bell introduced a concept called interest convergence that says that anytime
*  White any time black people get more rights. It was because it was also in the interest of white people
*  So it was actually an act of racism
*  So if you become anti-racist, this is literal if you become anti-racist
*  There's books about this if you become anti-racist according to their demands for you to become anti-racist
*  That was in your best interest
*  It turns you into a good white a good white progressive or a good white liberal. There are entire books
*  There's a book by Shannon Sullivan a major scholar called good white people that just rails on this
*  Robin D Angelo says that she thinks that that white progressives and white liberals are the
*  worst form of holding white supremacy the worst form because they and then she because they they don't believe that
*  They're as racist as they actually are she says in fact that she defines a white progressive as somebody who thinks they're less racist or not
*  Racist and that's the worst kind of white supremacist. So there's no escaping racism in her eyes
*  None. It's it's not a choice between anti-racism and racism. It's a choice between
*  Anti-racism it's a choice between racists who will admit it and racists who are too fragile to admit it
*  That's actually her theory
*  And then because of this this interest convergence thesis of Derek Bell which is at the core of critical race theory to this day
*  Anything a white person does according to the theory. I don't agree with this anything a white person does
*  To help a black person also raises their own moral standing and is therefore in their own interest and was therefore a racist act
*  Whoa, whoa
*  So it's like again, this is supposed to cause healing. This is supposed to solve problems
*  It says that the problem I mean Derek Bell explicitly says and faces upon the well that racism is permanent that it cannot be fixed
*  So so what the hell are?
*  I'm an optimist. Why are we doing that? Well, that's just one individual, right? But did he have a
*  Solution that instead of desegregation to take what was his
*  Alternative well his general alternative was to constantly wage a critical war against white people and whiteness forever
*  Until the way that they believe that white supremacy and whiteness can be taken out of society is to completely in a full-on
*  revolution
*  Remake society from the bottom up that's in their literature all over the place
*  you can't get rid of whiteness until you get rid of all vestiges of white society and
*  That level of revolution is what's inspiring these frickin riots
*  Do they know about him and his work or is this just a continuation of the the idea?
*  The people that are involved in like in Tifa
*  Some of them would he's quite famous all of the scholars would every critical race scholar would he is the founder of critical race theory
*  He is the guy
*  Barack Obama talked very positively about him. I was a big fan of Obama still I'm a big fan of Obama
*  So I'm not like cracking on Obama
*  To say that but he was a big fan of Derek Bell's and they I think maybe even Derek Bell was one of Obama's teachers
*  But I don't know that for sure
*  In his law work so and again, I don't know that for sure
*  But they were definitely friends and and he definitely you know, very publicly had some weird friends
*  He was friends with one of those guys that was in the weathermen. Well, yeah, that's right. Yeah
*  the that's
*  They're not irrelevant to this either still. Yeah. Yeah, but
*  Derek Bell is central to critical race theory. He's not just some guy every scholar would know him
*  Everybody it's like the guy who's taking notes at church
*  He that person knows Derek Bell Derek Bell's that big of a figure. Do you see this?
*  Moving in any one particular direction. Do you see it Doug with the the retaking of Chaz?
*  Do you see things like dying off? Do you see this as being non sustainable? I don't think it's sustainable
*  It takes too much energy what I think it is. Okay, so I've described it before pretty publicly as a Trojan horse
*  So, you know the story the Trojan horse
*  They wheel up the horse and what's inside is assassins so they bring it in they open up from the inside come out kill
*  The guards open the gate and then the army can come through. This is a Trojan horse full of bureaucrats
*  So what they do is they go fill in administrations and then they fill in HR departments and then they start making
*  policy changes at those levels so that everybody's stuck playing by their rules and
*  A lot of cases there aren't necessarily that many of them and you actually can like kind of push them out. It's not that many
*  You could actually in a lot of organizations you will get sued they will bring a suit and they'll fire you I get these emails
*  From from guys who run businesses. I don't know if they're guys actually always there's some of them aren't but the
*  CEOs in particular and they say well a lot of times there's just people in the office and you know how they are and
*  So they come in and they ask for a promotion and you know
*  They're gonna make trouble if you don't give it to them. So it's just easier to give it to them and kind of let them
*  Do the thing and it's like?
*  We really need to stop getting bullied
*  Do you think that part of this the movement and why it's so like with Antifa in particular and the looting and all the
*  craziness in the streets because people aren't working so it's like
*  There's so many more people that have the time to do this and so it really refueled. It's like dry wood on a fire
*  That's right. I think that's part of it. I mean, I think the conditions at the moment are particularly
*  Good for having manifested this to the level of the state
*  Manifested this to the level that it manifested in reality. I'm worried
*  It's gonna stoke the fire of racism and a lot of people
*  I mean people that were on the fence
*  Yeah, there were racists that maybe maybe could be coaxed over to a more reasonable position will now be upset
*  I think I think that's right. There's a real fear of it
*  If you just tell people that they're racist no matter what yes, some of them are just gonna accept it
*  But there's no way out now
*  I will tell you I am friends with people from all over the spectrum right except woke there
*  They've now all written me off and I have some pretty far right-wing friends. They are not racists
*  By any normal definition of the word
*  But of course under woke they have to be because everybody is
*  They are saying things like the word racist doesn't mean anything to me anymore
*  But that doesn't mean I'm gonna be racist. I'm going to just keep acting the way that I was acting which is not racist
*  But I'm not gonna if somebody calls me a racist. It doesn't mean anything to me anymore
*  I'm just gonna keep acting the way I was acting. I already wasn't racist
*  I'm just gonna keep going and they're basically gonna try to just step out of the language game
*  I don't think most people will do that, but there will be a contingent and this is where your fears are valid where that's gonna happen
*  But some of them are gonna grab onto that identity and they're gonna latch on to it
*  and of course, what is what is the theory say critical race theory says that
*  Everybody's a racist and it's just hiding it under a mask
*  And so if they start acting racist they're all they were racist all along
*  And they do this to people in their jobs
*  I know people who disagree with woke stuff who have applied for jobs and there's these professional forums and then people set it up
*  And they say we're gonna you know
*  He's associated with this or associated with that so we can't hire and make sure he's not gonna get an academic job
*  And I've actually seen screenshots people sent me of the texts where the point is that we make sure he can't get an academic job
*  So he has to take a job with some right-wing outlet then we call him a conservative and he's done
*  Oh, Jesus Christ, right?
*  And it's like at some point you just realize oh, this is bullshit
*  And then once you realize this bullshit, you're sort of free of it
*  Well, what you realize is it actually is a culture war, correct?
*  I actually is I don't know one of my more
*  Controversial beliefs right now is that we might actually be in a second Civil War already
*  In the sense though that it's being fought in information and in culture not in
*  Not in in hot war, which one's the Union?
*  The liberals not left like left and right Democrat Republican
*  But like the people who believe in like what the Constitution and I'm not actually free speech. Yeah free discourse
*  Correct. Yeah, but there's not that many of them or if they are they're being silent
*  There means I think there are actually a lot of them and they're being silenced. There's a I think there's a very
*  The right word right there being silenced
*  they're afraid to speak up and I know because they email me and tell me things like I
*  Have a fake account that I follow you on Twitter or I come and look at your Twitter, but I can't follow you
*  Yeah, I can't like your stuff
*  I get offers to write things sometimes and then they get taken back because I'm like too controversial or something where I get really
*  cynicals when I see corporations go woke and I'm like you guys aren't doing this because you're
*  Ethical people you're doing this because this is where the profits where the money is
*  So now we've found my fourth and fifth black lives matter, right?
*  So I said there are five. Yeah number four is the anti-fug guys number five is the woke woke black lives matter. Sorry
*  corporate corporate black lives matter corporate black lives matter is I mean
*  Capitalism always wins. Yeah, it's a it but it's they're gonna go where they see the least liability and
*  Where they see the most likelihood to you know generate profit and there I can't I mean
*  I'm not gonna say that I don't support capitalism in general, but I don't support the
*  exploitation of a
*  of a movement based in pain and fear to to sell t-shirts or
*  Shoes or whatever else? Yeah, that's what it gets really weird. It's like you
*  Again, this is the cynical part of me admittedly
*  But I see I and I see what they're doing and I don't believe though
*  I don't ever any time a corporation is putting out some sort of a message
*  I think that they're thinking about their bottom line and I think there's a good side to that and a bad side
*  There's a cynical side and there's also the side that money is one of those neutral things like Michael Jordan has that
*  That documentary just came out recently about him and one of the things they show in that is where
*  He got pushed into you know
*  Some make a statement about something or another and he quoted I don't know the exact quote
*  It's like conservatives buy shoes too
*  Yes, so it's like there's an equalizer there were mad at him
*  They got it really mad at him and they're mad at him again for that
*  But there's an equalizer there right money doesn't care what color you are and so there's an equalizer side, but
*  Corporations are there to make money. That's the point and
*  So they're gonna go whichever direction seems to work that way what I would urge any
*  Corporation people out there watching right now to consider is that there will be litigation attempted in the other direction
*  And you may be opening yourself up to liability in the attempt to avoid liability, so you know weigh your options more carefully
*  God damn it. Damn it
*  Is there anything else you want to go over before we get out of here?
*  I think we're at like the three-hour mark are we yeah?
*  What could we say that would like absolutely end both of our careers so we think you did it so we can go like Thelma and
*  Louise into the canyon I
*  Don't think it's gonna end our careers because I think one of the things that it's very
*  Important for people like you and people like me now is to be that person
*  Who points things out that are logical and reasonable and when you hear your words you know well?
*  You're not a bigot. You're not a racist. You're not a sexist. You're not homophobic. You're not transphobic
*  You're just a person using logic, and you're standing up to this ideology
*  That seems to avoid any and all criticism
*  That's right, and it does so like a religion that's right, and that's what's dangerous about it is because we have these
*  religious tendencies we have these fundamentalist
*  ideological tendencies to adopt a
*  particular pattern of thinking and behavior and to stick with it without
*  Deviation because if you do you'll be ostracized, and that's what you're seeing with woke culture. That's right
*  So you know the you bring up religion again and forgiveness to right yes you learn from your mistakes
*  This is horrifying me that teenagers are like calling each other out and like these cancel like yeah, whatever the hell they're doing
*  It's like no you have to be allowed to make mistakes
*  You have to be allowed to mess up and grow from that and then be acknowledged for having gone through that and grown
*  That's so important for people to realize this it's key to life. It's not even just key to society
*  It's key to life. That's a beautiful way to end this. Thank you sir in your book
*  Cynical theories is available right now Helen pluck rose the second most English woman's name on planet
*  That's right the other one is her daughter. What's hers Lucy Lucy pluck rose. That's yeah, that's
*  Some seriously Harry Potter type shit and James Lindsay right there, and you can follow James on Twitter
*  I highly recommend that he's one of my best follows. I
*  Appreciate you very much. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you for being there. Goodbye everybody
