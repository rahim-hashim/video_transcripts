# JRE MMA Show #139 with Bas Rutten
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6.0s)]
*  Mr. Rooten, good to see you sir. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10.0s)]
*  Been a while. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=15.0s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=17.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was exciting running into you out here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=18.0s)]
*  Texas, you're a Texas resident. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=20.0s)]
*  Texas, I got a hat and everything. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=21.0s)]
*  I need a belt buckle. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=23.0s)]
*  Did you get a hat? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=24.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, I got the boots. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=25.0s)]
*  And I rode a Longhorn for a, what was it, in this little village here somewhere, Banderas. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=27.0s)]
*  Like a big, big freaking Longhorn. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=33.0s)]
*  You got on one of those things? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=36.0s)]
*  Oh I got one, yeah I rode one. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=37.0s)]
*  Did they let you ride them or did they try to buck you off? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=38.0s)]
*  No, he said this guy is hanging out with kids, like six years old. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=40.0s)]
*  He's very, very calm. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=44.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=46.0s)]
*  Those Longhorns are wild, huh? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=47.0s)]
*  Dude, it's crazy if you see it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=49.0s)]
*  Giant, yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=51.0s)]
*  Yeah, everybody, the whole street will stop. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=52.0s)]
*  When did you come out here? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=54.0s)]
*  July 4th, the 4th of July last year. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=59.0s)]
*  Fireworks and everything. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=60.0s)]
*  I was in the top building, we had an apartment for a year. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=61.0s)]
*  So it was give us time a year to find a home, which we did, so we're probably going to move in next week. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=64.0s)]
*  But the top building, it was the park, Atlanta Park in New Braunfels where they have the fireworks. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=69.0s)]
*  I mean, it was nice. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=75.0s)]
*  They welcomed me on the 4th of July with the fireworks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=77.0s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=80.0s)]
*  You finally get fed up with California, huh? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=82.0s)]
*  Yeah, doesn't everybody? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=84.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=86.0s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=87.0s)]
*  I would have never imagined five years ago that there would be this mass exodus. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=88.0s)]
*  And then most of my friends would live out here now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=93.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=96.0s)]
*  But also Ventura County, where I'm from, it's like Orange County, still the laws are a little bit easier. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=97.0s)]
*  Then LA, LA. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=101.0s)]
*  But once it starts getting there, my wife already said for six years, here we got to go. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=103.0s)]
*  This is going to go wrong. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=109.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=110.0s)]
*  Well, I was always wanting to get out, but I was so connected to the comedy store that I always felt like, God, I can't leave that place behind. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=120.0s)]
*  But then when the pandemic hit, it's like, well, I guess we're not even doing comedy anymore, so fuck it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=121.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=125.0s)]
*  Do it here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=126.0s)]
*  And now you got one. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=128.0s)]
*  Yeah, now I got one. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=129.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=130.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=131.0s)]
*  Life has been crazy for you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=132.0s)]
*  The whole thing is crazy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=133.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=134.0s)]
*  So you settling in out here and enjoying it? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=135.0s)]
*  We're loving it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=137.0s)]
*  But you know, the people, every single person who comes to visit, you know, they're all, it's a little bit preserved, you know, the Texas mentality. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=138.0s)]
*  But when they come off the plane, it's the first thing they say. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=147.0s)]
*  Until now, like eight out of eight, people are so nice here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=150.0s)]
*  It's the first thing they say. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=154.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=155.0s)]
*  So I think they really love it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=156.0s)]
*  We have a daughter, the middle daughter that I have, she still lives in California. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=158.0s)]
*  And she didn't really like Texas, but now she's been here and her fiancee, they were here last week. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=163.0s)]
*  And I see it with him as well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=168.0s)]
*  He goes, it's really nice here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=170.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's different. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=172.0s)]
*  And it's also less people. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=174.0s)]
*  The less people thing is gigantic. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=176.0s)]
*  I don't think you can underestimate that enough. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=180.0s)]
*  Because I think, or overestimate that enough, because overstate that enough. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=181.0s)]
*  I think that people get too used to too many people and then they view people as a nuisance. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=184.0s)]
*  And I don't hear that hasn't happened. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=190.0s)]
*  Out here when people just, they're friendly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=192.0s)]
*  They're just friendly to people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=195.0s)]
*  They're different as well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=196.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=198.0s)]
*  I think that... [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=199.0s)]
*  Well, they're armed. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=200.0s)]
*  That helps, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=201.0s)]
*  That helps a lot. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=203.0s)]
*  It's like on a plane, everybody should get a little baseball bat, you know, when they walk in. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=205.0s)]
*  I go to the hygiene of the plane. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=209.0s)]
*  Or a taser. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=211.0s)]
*  Or a taser? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah, but a taser with me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=213.0s)]
*  And at the time when I was, you know, okay, so a friend of mine, Holberkallini, you know, from Mindhunter, that actor, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=215.0s)]
*  he gave me a taser. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=221.0s)]
*  So at my birthday, I open it up, I grab the taser, I put the battery in, I'm looking up, and not a single person is in the room. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=223.0s)]
*  Everybody ran out. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=234.0s)]
*  You see? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=235.0s)]
*  Because they think you're going to try it on. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=236.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=238.0s)]
*  Any person I see, I'm going to try it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=239.0s)]
*  So I would do that on the plane as well. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=240.0s)]
*  It was immediately, it was the funniest thing ever. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=243.0s)]
*  I go, where is everybody? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=247.0s)]
*  Did you tase anybody yet? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=248.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=249.0s)]
*  No one? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=250.0s)]
*  Not even yourself? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=251.0s)]
*  I really, I want to try it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=252.0s)]
*  I would just jab my thigh one time just to see what's up. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=255.0s)]
*  Oh, that I did. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=258.0s)]
*  I did it even on my head. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=259.0s)]
*  You know, that I did. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=260.0s)]
*  But I want to see if they, because they say it's impossible. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=261.0s)]
*  And I might be full of myself. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=265.0s)]
*  I think I can pull them out. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=267.0s)]
*  But, you know, I would love to try it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=268.0s)]
*  Some people can take it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=270.0s)]
*  I've watched videos. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=272.0s)]
*  There's some people that are on certain drugs that they just pull those things right out of their body. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=273.0s)]
*  I saw one where the cops had to shoot the guy because they tased him and the guy kept coming at him. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=278.0s)]
*  And then finally he's like, okay. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=283.0s)]
*  You're going to die now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=286.0s)]
*  Bang, bang. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=289.0s)]
*  It was crazy though, because some people just stiffen up. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=290.0s)]
*  They fall down and this guy just fucking. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=292.0s)]
*  I think I got mind over matter. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=295.0s)]
*  But then again, I don't even know if it's mind over matter. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=297.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=300.0s)]
*  Maybe it was a weak taser because that's one of the things that a friend of mine told me. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=301.0s)]
*  And it's actually in a book. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=305.0s)]
*  It's one in one of the Grey Men books that those those tasers are like, especially the personal ones that people have. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=306.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=312.0s)]
*  They vastly overestimate the stopping power of those things. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=313.0s)]
*  Because girls think I'm going to get you with this taser. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=317.0s)]
*  Don't get the wrong person. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=319.0s)]
*  They might fuck you up even with that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=321.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=323.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=324.0s)]
*  It doesn't just debilitate people. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=325.0s)]
*  No, if you have a taser you can use 20 times. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=326.0s)]
*  That's not a good thing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=328.0s)]
*  I rather have a taser that you can use only once. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=329.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=331.0s)]
*  Because the batteries drained out. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=332.0s)]
*  So you know it's going to work. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=335.0s)]
*  Yeah, because batteries go dead on flashlights. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=337.0s)]
*  I'm sure they go dead on tasers. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=340.0s)]
*  People running around with all this confidence. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=342.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=344.0s)]
*  That's how you create freaking heat. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=345.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=347.0s)]
*  So yeah, there's nothing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=348.0s)]
*  Nothing substitutes a nine millimeter. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=349.0s)]
*  If you want personal protection, you want a small like a sig P 365. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=351.0s)]
*  The health cats are very nice. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=357.0s)]
*  Shields. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=359.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=360.0s)]
*  They're very nice. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=361.0s)]
*  But they only hold like eight. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=362.0s)]
*  One in the bell. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=363.0s)]
*  And that's the extended mag. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=364.0s)]
*  Oh, you're out here now. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=365.0s)]
*  I got to get you a staccato. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=366.0s)]
*  Staccato has a CS. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=368.0s)]
*  It's a very small micro nine millimeter with I think it has 15 in the mag. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=369.0s)]
*  15 in the magazine and one in the chamber. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=374.0s)]
*  It's so small. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=377.0s)]
*  It just fits right in your hand. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=378.0s)]
*  I was doing this. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=380.0s)]
*  I interviewed a guy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=381.0s)]
*  I had this thing on Planet Boss. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=382.0s)]
*  It's called it's on Muscle and Fitness. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=384.0s)]
*  So I interviewed a guy at the shooting range here, McQueen is a gun club. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=388.0s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=392.0s)]
*  You walk in with the stilettos. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=393.0s)]
*  They call them here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=394.0s)]
*  That's how you call those knives. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=395.0s)]
*  They jump out in front and back. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=396.0s)]
*  Yeah, stiletto. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=397.0s)]
*  Stiletto. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=398.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=399.0s)]
*  They're completely legal here. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=400.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=401.0s)]
*  I go, you can sell them. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=402.0s)]
*  I go, yeah, this is Stax's buddy. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=403.0s)]
*  I go, oh man. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=404.0s)]
*  Everything is legal here. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=405.0s)]
*  Everything is legal. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=406.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=407.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=408.0s)]
*  It's literally everything. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=409.0s)]
*  You can have concealed carry is just your constitutional right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=410.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=411.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=412.0s)]
*  Don't have to get. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=413.0s)]
*  Amazing how friendly everyone is because that I'm not advocating for that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=414.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that's the good thing or a bad thing. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=415.6s)]
*  I'm just saying it's a thing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=417.8s)]
*  Just listen, when other people have it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=418.8s)]
*  People are less likely to get crazy. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=421.8s)]
*  Yeah, also. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=423.8s)]
*  But if bad people have it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=424.8s)]
*  I want to live in a gun free society. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=426.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=428.20000000000005s)]
*  As long as they have them, I have them. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=429.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  Although there was a very sad story out here where a guy, someone was trying to break into [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  his yard or something like that or someone climbed his fence and he went out in his own. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  I guess someone called the police or he called the police and he went out into his own yard [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=440.36s)]
*  with an A.R. and when the cops saw him, the cops shot him. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=445.2s)]
*  Oh, gee. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=450.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=451.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=452.52s)]
*  In his own fucking backyard. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=453.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=454.52s)]
*  Very sad. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=455.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=456.52s)]
*  Well, that's a lesson. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=457.52s)]
*  Don't walk around with an A.R. in the middle of the night. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=458.52s)]
*  Well, when you see the cops, put that motherfucker down. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=462.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what the circumstances were, obviously. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=464.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  But. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  Sad for the family. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  That's the first thing I think about. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=470.91999999999996s)]
*  Always. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  So, how was Karate Combat, man? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=473.64000000000004s)]
*  I love it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=476.6s)]
*  I just came back. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=477.6s)]
*  I've been watching a lot. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=478.6s)]
*  I saw James Vick fought in Karate Combat. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  And a lot of Glory guys fight in Karate Combat now. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=483.08000000000004s)]
*  James just wanted to invite me for a hog hunting. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=487.36s)]
*  I go, I'm in. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=489.88s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=490.88s)]
*  I would love to do that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=491.88s)]
*  I just came back yesterday from Miami. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=493.6s)]
*  It was a great show. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=497.24s)]
*  I got to get out to one of these. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=499.0s)]
*  You have to. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=500.36s)]
*  When is the next one? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=501.36s)]
*  June 24th. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=502.8s)]
*  Where at? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=503.8s)]
*  I think Miami. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=504.8s)]
*  This one is Miami or Orlando. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=505.8s)]
*  June 20th. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=506.8s)]
*  Give me an excuse to go back to Miami, because I like Miami. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=507.8s)]
*  Man, if you would, because they've been asking for such a long time. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's great. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=512.96s)]
*  Maybe I'll take the misses. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=513.96s)]
*  And the experience. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=515.4s)]
*  You know, if you go June 24th, I'm planning on to take my wife as well. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=516.4s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I want to take her more on trips now, because you know, all the time, crazy times [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  are over. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=524.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=525.6s)]
*  And now, let's enjoy a little bit. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=526.6s)]
*  Don't you appreciate that now? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=527.88s)]
*  So much better. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=529.52s)]
*  You can just get on a plane, no mask, everybody's happy. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=530.68s)]
*  No, but also with me, my crazy freaking, like, okay, 15 years ago, you know, I would come [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=533.28s)]
*  home at 8 o'clock in the morning completely drunk and at 9 o'clock I got a flight. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=539.24s)]
*  Now I'm walking at the airport 6 in the morning, I go, I'm feeling great. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=543.28s)]
*  Sober. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=546.52s)]
*  Sober. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=547.52s)]
*  Sober boss. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=548.52s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=549.52s)]
*  How long have you been sober for? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=550.52s)]
*  Oh, you know, I do drink here and there, like a glass of wine or something. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=551.52s)]
*  But yeah, for a while, I think, for the last five years. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=554.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm taking it down to that myself. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=557.3199999999999s)]
*  I enjoy the marijuana and I enjoy some other stuff that's safe and effective. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=559.48s)]
*  But I am pretty much done with heavy drinking. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=565.6s)]
*  I had a friend recently that got off the rails drunk and it was so sad to watch. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=568.0s)]
*  He was so debilitated that I was like, I think I might be done. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=573.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=576.76s)]
*  It was awful. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=577.76s)]
*  You see, just when you're sober and you see someone just shit faced, obliterated, can't [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=578.76s)]
*  form sentences. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=584.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=585.24s)]
*  Terrible for you. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=586.24s)]
*  No, it's horrible. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=587.24s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=589.0s)]
*  That's why I don't go to the after parties anymore, which they had here with the last [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=590.0s)]
*  karate combat. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=596.08s)]
*  So yeah, coming back to that, these are just Wall Street guys who started this thing. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=597.08s)]
*  Karate combat? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=601.84s)]
*  Karate combat. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=602.84s)]
*  They wanted to start a boxing thing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=603.84s)]
*  His wife's brother, who doesn't even speak English, he said, we should start a boxing [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=604.84s)]
*  event or something. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  And then maybe you should get these Olympic level karate cars and do a full contact show. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=609.5600000000001s)]
*  And he goes, oh, let me Google. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=614.8s)]
*  And they started Googling it and they realized there's nothing like it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=616.96s)]
*  That's literally how it started. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=619.0400000000001s)]
*  And then it's when they go to the ground, they can punch them on the ground for 10 seconds? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  Five seconds. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=624.52s)]
*  Five seconds. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=625.52s)]
*  Yeah, George was with me, George St. Pierre. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=626.52s)]
*  He's one of the hosts as well as Wonder Boy, Leota Bichita. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=628.44s)]
*  But he was advocating about three seconds. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=635.0400000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=638.52s)]
*  Five seconds is already a short time. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=639.52s)]
*  I think you need to, he says, but three then they probably hit harder. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=641.08s)]
*  I go, whatever his reasoning is. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=644.92s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=646.96s)]
*  But it's a great rule to have. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=648.88s)]
*  That's first of all. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=650.4s)]
*  We haven't seen a knockout yet. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=651.4s)]
*  The stakedowns, you can use the pit, those 45 degree angle walls. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=653.24s)]
*  So you can literally walk up there and then drop a guy which you already stuck. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=656.36s)]
*  Well, you've had knockouts. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=659.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, we had a lot of knockouts. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=660.76s)]
*  What do you mean by you haven't seen a knockout? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=661.76s)]
*  You mean on the ground? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=663.4s)]
*  Ground and pound. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=664.4s)]
*  Oh, ground and pound. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=665.4s)]
*  No ground and pound knockouts yet. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=666.4s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=667.4s)]
*  Well, we had Elijah Averell just came in as a point karate guy. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=668.4s)]
*  And he was, I actually have some clips. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  He's the guy who trained with Raymond Daniels. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=676.68s)]
*  Everybody was speaking about him. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=678.56s)]
*  He's going to be great. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=680.0799999999999s)]
*  Do it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=681.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you want to watch this one. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  Is this him, right? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=683.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, so this is the first time. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  This is a karate guy on the right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=685.92s)]
*  Abdullah Ibrahim and that's Joshua Cuihagen. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=687.5999999999999s)]
*  And he thought he's going to. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=689.92s)]
*  Oh! [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  You see, karate guys. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=692.8399999999999s)]
*  Whoa, show that again. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=694.3599999999999s)]
*  Show that again. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=696.0799999999999s)]
*  These guys with their hands down like that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=697.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, left hook. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=702.24s)]
*  Left hook. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=703.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=704.24s)]
*  And then there is on these. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=708.24s)]
*  There's another clip. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=709.24s)]
*  They have a Bitcoin logo in the center. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=710.24s)]
*  I had to watch it at the time. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=713.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=714.24s)]
*  Oh, these are Wall Street guys. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=715.24s)]
*  This is a long time ago. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=716.24s)]
*  I love the banked edges too. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=719.0s)]
*  I really do like that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=721.0s)]
*  I don't like the cage. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=722.4s)]
*  I feel like it just gets, even in MMA, I feel like it gets in the way of so much. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=724.6s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=731.0799999999999s)]
*  Boom! [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, beautiful left hook. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=733.0799999999999s)]
*  Over the shoulder. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=734.0799999999999s)]
*  Didn't even see it coming. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=735.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, and the great thing is if you fall against a wall, you're not considered to be [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=736.0799999999999s)]
*  down. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  So you can do anything to your opponent. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  This is down once you're on the ground ground. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=743.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=746.04s)]
*  But on the wall, you're still okay. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=747.04s)]
*  There's another clip with Elijah Everill. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=748.4799999999999s)]
*  Here's the guy, the point karate guy. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=752.64s)]
*  Okay, watch this. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=754.52s)]
*  Which one is it? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=755.52s)]
*  Yeah, this is good. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=756.52s)]
*  Watch this play right there because that's it there. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=758.24s)]
*  Watch what happens when you go slow. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=762.04s)]
*  Oh. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=764.04s)]
*  Yeah, you'll see this is slow motion. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=765.04s)]
*  He wanted to kick him with that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=766.96s)]
*  You're going to see in slow mode the way he did. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=770.16s)]
*  You can't kick once they touch the ground. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=772.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=773.92s)]
*  But you can punch. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=774.92s)]
*  You can still punch. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=775.92s)]
*  What do you think about that with MMA? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=776.92s)]
*  Like pride rules versus... [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=779.0s)]
*  Watch the kick in the face now. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=781.52s)]
*  That's a different thing. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=782.52s)]
*  Oh, boom. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=783.52s)]
*  As he's going down. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=784.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=785.52s)]
*  As he's kind of almost down. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=786.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=787.52s)]
*  Like what do you... [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=788.52s)]
*  And this is against the wall. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=789.52s)]
*  He's allowed to do everything. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=790.52s)]
*  This is not considered to be down if you're leaning against the wall. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=791.52s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=795.52s)]
*  But you can... [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=796.52s)]
*  You're not down, but you can kick to the body when they're down. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=797.52s)]
*  Can you kick to the body? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=800.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=801.88s)]
*  Kick to the body. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=802.88s)]
*  Stomp. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=803.88s)]
*  No, the hat also. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=804.88s)]
*  Not kicking the head, of course. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=805.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=806.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=807.88s)]
*  But you can kick the head when they're down. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=808.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=809.88s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=810.88s)]
*  Because like old school pride rules, there was something wild about... [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=811.88s)]
*  Obviously, 1FC has sort of followed those style of rules in a cage, which is different [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=813.5200000000001s)]
*  because your head can get trapped in a cage and you can get stomped. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=819.64s)]
*  Whereas in old school pride, it was the ropes and guys would... [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=824.2s)]
*  Try to slide out of the ropes. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=829.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  Those stomps, once you saw Vandalis Silver going to that orona against Sakuraba, they're [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  holding the ropes for the balance. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=839.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=841.32s)]
*  And Sakuraba is kicking somebody's face in. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  What I do like always is knees to the head on the ground. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=846.0s)]
*  I rather have that than elbows. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  Elbows are most of the time are cuts. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=852.1600000000001s)]
*  These are knockouts. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=853.8000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  So do you really want to lose because of a cut? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=855.8000000000001s)]
*  In a street fight, you wouldn't, right? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=857.72s)]
*  I mean, you wouldn't stop. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=859.0s)]
*  So the losing by a cut, frowned upon for a fighter. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=860.0400000000001s)]
*  It's still a loss. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=863.32s)]
*  Well, there are some knockouts on the ground with elbows for sure. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=864.32s)]
*  More and more now. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=866.84s)]
*  We see it more. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=867.84s)]
*  But before, it was just cuts. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=868.84s)]
*  98% cuts. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=871.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=872.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=873.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=874.36s)]
*  It's interesting because the turtle position, when someone shoots in a failed shot and they [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=875.36s)]
*  just hang out there and they're allowed, because a person can't knee them in the head, boy, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=880.4s)]
*  that's a very vulnerable position. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  You would never stay there in a street fight. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=887.96s)]
*  No. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=890.24s)]
*  Never. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=891.24s)]
*  You saw that, the one I see with Roger Huerta when he was in the... [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=892.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=894.84s)]
*  That was like... [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=895.84s)]
*  I thought somebody was going to get killed. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=896.84s)]
*  That was a bad one. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=898.32s)]
*  That was a bad one. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=899.32s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=900.8000000000001s)]
*  And that was also a guy much bigger than him too. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=901.8000000000001s)]
*  Like Roger fought 155 in the UFC and then he goes over and in one, he's fighting these [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=904.0400000000001s)]
*  very big guys. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=909.4000000000001s)]
*  And he's already messed up. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=910.4000000000001s)]
*  He's falling literally on the ground for his balance. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=911.96s)]
*  And then he gets soccer kicked. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=915.12s)]
*  And then he gets soccer kicked full. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=916.12s)]
*  That was scary. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=917.12s)]
*  Find that because it was one of the worst KOs. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=918.12s)]
*  And Roger, man, what an interesting story that is and kind of a sad story because he [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=922.12s)]
*  was very, very promising. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  He was on the cover of Sports Illustrated. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=927.5200000000001s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=929.92s)]
*  That's the curse, right? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=930.92s)]
*  They always talk about the Sports Illustrated curse, the cover? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=931.92s)]
*  Mike Tyson was on the cover of Sports Illustrated too. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=935.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=937.12s)]
*  Forget about it. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=938.12s)]
*  Check that. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=939.12s)]
*  Kid Dynamite. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=940.12s)]
*  It's in my office at home. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=941.12s)]
*  He was 19. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=942.12s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=943.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=944.12s)]
*  That curse don't mean shit. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=945.12s)]
*  For him, it doesn't. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=946.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=947.12s)]
*  He's a special guy. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=948.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=950.12s)]
*  But the Roger Huerta thing, what happened was he ran a foul. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=951.12s)]
*  Some people were talking to him or I don't know. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=954.84s)]
*  Him and the UFC didn't get along all of a sudden, which is crazy because the UFC wanted to promote [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=959.12s)]
*  him. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=964.92s)]
*  He's this good looking guy. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=965.92s)]
*  He's talented. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=966.92s)]
*  He's tough as shit. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=967.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=968.92s)]
*  And then winds up losing and then the UFC drops him because there was all sorts of conflict [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=969.92s)]
*  between the two of them. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=974.24s)]
*  And he's like, I'm going to go fight other places. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=975.24s)]
*  And then he went over there and we lost him. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=976.84s)]
*  Well, you have these guys that are on this trajectory that if they, you know, there's [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=979.72s)]
*  guys. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=984.92s)]
*  Limited time. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=985.92s)]
*  What do you have, like nine years to perform at your very best? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=987.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=990.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=991.12s)]
*  That's what I get. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=992.12s)]
*  I can really find him on there. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=993.12s)]
*  I think this, I don't know if this is it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=994.12s)]
*  It doesn't seem to be a KO or anything. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=998.7199999999999s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1000.12s)]
*  It's just a crazy fight between them. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1001.12s)]
*  No, this is not a Cojeando. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1002.12s)]
*  It was a Brazilian guy. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1004.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1006.52s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1007.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1008.52s)]
*  You already. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1009.52s)]
*  He's taking a lot of punishment. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1010.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1011.52s)]
*  You can already see that going. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1012.52s)]
*  You see the guys who are older guys still performing really well. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1015.16s)]
*  I think Raymond Daniels right now, who's fighting for karate combat, you know, he's still freaking. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1017.9599999999999s)]
*  And by the way, he fought, oh, so he's over 40. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1022.36s)]
*  He fought Rafael Agayev, who's considered the goat of karate, right? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1025.96s)]
*  Five world titles, 11 European titles. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1029.08s)]
*  This guy's a freaking bastard. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1030.68s)]
*  Everybody, when you would have to bet, you forced to bet, you put your house on freaking [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1032.68s)]
*  Raymond Daniels. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1038.24s)]
*  Agayev beat him. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1039.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1041.24s)]
*  By decision? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1042.24s)]
*  By decision. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1043.32s)]
*  So his reflex and everybody and the president, Adam Kovac, he told me before he says Agayev [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1044.32s)]
*  is going to win. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1050.36s)]
*  And I go, oh, man, that's the big, he says he's going to win. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1051.36s)]
*  And now also after the fight, they say, oh, we have the blueprint. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1055.24s)]
*  He says, no, because nobody's like a guy. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1057.52s)]
*  His reflexes, I mean, every time you saw Daniels move, he was already in there. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1059.84s)]
*  But now, you know, in Daniels' mind, because this guy, he's going to download everything [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1064.06s)]
*  that went wrong. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1068.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1069.48s)]
*  And then you see him fight the next fight. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1070.48s)]
*  He's a scary guy as well, the stuff that he does, right? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1072.2s)]
*  Daniels is amazing. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1075.1200000000001s)]
*  His ability to incorporate that point style karate and also into kickboxing. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1076.44s)]
*  I mean, he had a lot of courage. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1081.88s)]
*  Going into Glory, when he fought those guys, he really wasn't accustomed to leg kicks. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1084.48s)]
*  Joseph Valtellini beat him. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1090.96s)]
*  And that's how he beat him, just chopped those legs, chopped those legs, and eventually headkicked [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1093.52s)]
*  him. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1097.28s)]
*  Yeah, but the 720 punch, did you ever see that thing? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1098.28s)]
*  Oh my God, it was insane. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1100.68s)]
*  And then he decided, because actually, George Palmer, my commentating partner in karate [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1102.16s)]
*  combat, he asked him about it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1108.4s)]
*  He says, were you first about to throw a kick? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1110.04s)]
*  And he says, actually, I was. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1113.2s)]
*  But then once he was in the air, the distance got close too fast. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1114.8400000000001s)]
*  He knew he had to change it. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1118.24s)]
*  And then in the air, he was going, oh, did I leave the stove on? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1119.4s)]
*  We're going, oh, I'm actually right. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1121.52s)]
*  And then he made it into a freaking right hook. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1122.52s)]
*  That is one of, oh, here's the right hook. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1125.8s)]
*  This one's terrible. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1128.04s)]
*  Boom. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1129.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1130.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1131.3999999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  He's already out. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1133.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's already out and turtled up. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1134.3999999999999s)]
*  And that guy plants it on the neck. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1136.76s)]
*  I mean, that is one of the worst KOs ever. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1139.08s)]
*  And the amount of power that you can generate from that short a distance, I mean, he was [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1142.08s)]
*  already fucked up. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1145.8799999999999s)]
*  If you back it up a little bit, Jeremy, you can see. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  I just have to say that's the best I could find. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1149.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he was already fucked up. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1150.8799999999999s)]
*  And again, undersized, much, much smaller than this guy. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1153.68s)]
*  And then the neck kick. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1156.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, horrible. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1158.0s)]
*  Yeah, not good. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1159.0s)]
*  But thankfully, we don't have that in karate combat. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1161.96s)]
*  But he actually kicks those to the body. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1164.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1166.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1167.64s)]
*  Well, George used to use those to the body. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1168.64s)]
*  George St. Pierre? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1169.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1170.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1171.64s)]
*  That's a great technique to the body for a downed opponent. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1172.64s)]
*  I mean, that heel slamming down like that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1174.64s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1176.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1177.64s)]
*  I remember I was talking to George yesterday about pointing, right? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1178.64s)]
*  I like it when you have gloves so you can point. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1182.0s)]
*  I would fight, fight, fight, point and low kick. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1184.16s)]
*  And every time when you do that, you're painting a picture for your opponent, right? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1186.64s)]
*  So he's attaching you pointing to the low kick and make it actually you throwing a low [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1189.84s)]
*  kick. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1194.1999999999998s)]
*  And then once you get used to that, of course, you break that pair and you're pointing high. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1195.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you're going high. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1198.28s)]
*  And I said the master who did that was Dwayne Ludwig. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1199.28s)]
*  It was in a fight and the guy is on the ground and Dwayne walks up to him and points straight [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1202.08s)]
*  at his head. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1207.9199999999998s)]
*  So the guy puts his guard up, one shot to the solar plexus. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1208.9199999999998s)]
*  Fight was over. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1213.32s)]
*  You see, stuff like that. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1214.32s)]
*  I really enjoy when people do it like that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1215.8799999999999s)]
*  That's Ross Levine. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1217.9199999999998s)]
*  I know that he's the middleweight champion from karate combat. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1219.0s)]
*  He's also with Bang Muay Thai. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1221.44s)]
*  You see that guy fight. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1223.24s)]
*  Every organization is going to go. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1225.88s)]
*  I've only watched clips online. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1226.88s)]
*  I've never watched a full event. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1227.88s)]
*  Freaking 100% in control. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1230.96s)]
*  Whatever happens. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1233.0s)]
*  It's, you know, once I pull up a video of him. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1234.0s)]
*  Yeah, go. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1237.6000000000001s)]
*  Ross Levine. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1238.6000000000001s)]
*  Ross Levine, Karate Combat 39 is the main event. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1239.6000000000001s)]
*  Just go to the second round because the first and he's fighting a really freaking tough [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1242.96s)]
*  guy who's from the Olympic team at karate in this country. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1246.4s)]
*  He got a Castaneda. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1250.5600000000002s)]
*  He just makes him look like a zero chance. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1252.88s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1254.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1256.88s)]
*  Ross is in the black. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1257.88s)]
*  Look at this distance the whole time. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1258.88s)]
*  Fainting so underused in fighting. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1268.52s)]
*  The way he stalks him. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1272.44s)]
*  Sees everything. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1275.3999999999999s)]
*  Now, why do they have to wear pants? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1276.3999999999999s)]
*  Is that just because it's karate? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1278.3999999999999s)]
*  That's just for the karate. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1280.3999999999999s)]
*  Then why don't they wear tops? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1281.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, you should ask them. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1284.3999999999999s)]
*  It seems like you should be able to wear shorts. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1285.3999999999999s)]
*  It's like anything that would impede the movement of your legs. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1287.3999999999999s)]
*  And I'm not saying that pants do. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1290.3999999999999s)]
*  They don't that much. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1292.68s)]
*  But it's a little bit. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1293.68s)]
*  No, but the gi does. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1294.96s)]
*  You know, we saw this also with the Hoys Grace in Sakuraba, right? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1295.96s)]
*  The gi is always a nightmare. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1300.9199999999998s)]
*  Get rid of the gi. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1302.9199999999998s)]
*  Keep the belt. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1304.24s)]
*  Long pants are okay as long as they're a little stretchy. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1305.24s)]
*  It's kind of cool because it shows you that it's karate. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1307.4399999999998s)]
*  But you know, I would prefer shorts because I feel like shorts I can move my legs better. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1310.52s)]
*  Not much difference. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1316.9199999999998s)]
*  Obviously, karate tournaments, staccato tournaments are all fought with the gi on. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1318.28s)]
*  I can actually Sambo. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1323.1999999999998s)]
*  They go with shorts. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1324.6s)]
*  In some events at least. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1328.04s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1329.76s)]
*  But you see the control he has. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1331.8799999999999s)]
*  Everything he's got. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1334.2s)]
*  Distance. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1335.2s)]
*  Everything is caught. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1336.2s)]
*  And the way it's like the first time he knocked him out, the guy falls back, makes a spinning [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1337.2s)]
*  Ushiro Moriishi yodan gear to the head. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1341.48s)]
*  Now this is karate, but it's constant contact. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1344.18s)]
*  It's constant action. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1347.92s)]
*  It's not point. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1349.92s)]
*  So where do these guys come from? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1350.92s)]
*  Do they come from point backgrounds? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1352.76s)]
*  Kickboxing backgrounds? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1354.6399999999999s)]
*  A lot of these guys came from the point background. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1355.64s)]
*  You see them, the evolution. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1357.68s)]
*  I mean, in the beginning, they would literally throw one punch, they scream and they stop [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1359.0s)]
*  while the opponent kept going. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1362.92s)]
*  They go, oh, shoot. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1364.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I got to keep going. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1365.2800000000002s)]
*  And they make combinations. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1366.2800000000002s)]
*  So you see them. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1367.2800000000002s)]
*  Oh, you have to go up the ramp to sit in your corner too. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1368.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1370.92s)]
*  Yeah, there's enough of this. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1371.92s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1374.92s)]
*  So did he, is Ross Levine, does he come from a point background? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1377.0400000000002s)]
*  He's a point background karate guy, but he was also to glory. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1381.0800000000002s)]
*  He went to other organizations. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1384.28s)]
*  He's just an incredible fighter. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1385.84s)]
*  And now he's coming full circle back to karate. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1388.52s)]
*  And he's, yeah, he became the champion right away. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1392.16s)]
*  He took the old champion's belt. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1394.0s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't even a contest. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1395.68s)]
*  So that guy in that situation, he knew that he couldn't get kicked to the head. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1398.2s)]
*  So you can kind of sit there. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1401.84s)]
*  What does he complain about? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1403.48s)]
*  I have no clue, but it's not good. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1404.72s)]
*  But just go to the very end. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1407.3999999999999s)]
*  You'll see him the way he drops everything. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1409.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like right there. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1414.28s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1419.28s)]
*  Why would you stop, right? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1420.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think he's kind of already on his way out, right? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1421.28s)]
*  So look, he just slid down there instead of standing up. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1424.84s)]
*  Now it's at least a downed opponent. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1427.3999999999999s)]
*  So now he has to wait for five seconds, right? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  Is that the strategy? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1430.8s)]
*  Well, you could. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1431.8s)]
*  But he's just getting beat up, right? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1432.8s)]
*  Yeah, this is, but look how, look at this. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1435.12s)]
*  Oh, so you can do that. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1439.8s)]
*  You can kick to the face there because the guy's not totally down. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1442.32s)]
*  He's just leaning against the thing. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1446.76s)]
*  Anything goes against the wall. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1448.6799999999998s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1450.28s)]
*  What a choice to make for him. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1451.28s)]
*  So and he, the Castaneda, he was complaining about this. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1453.3999999999999s)]
*  He said he wasn't out. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1456.52s)]
*  So they had a rematch. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1457.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1458.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1459.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1460.9199999999998s)]
*  And then he got annihilated. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  It's unfortunate that some of these guys who are mentally tough, they're great fighters, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1463.1599999999999s)]
*  but they just have this one place that if you can take them to there, they'll crack. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1469.0s)]
*  Yeah, big, right? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1472.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1473.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1474.76s)]
*  Like tough, tough guys. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1475.76s)]
*  But if you take them there, they fall apart. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1476.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1477.76s)]
*  But you go like, okay, with me, it was submissions. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1478.76s)]
*  And I go, you know what? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1480.36s)]
*  Maybe I should learn this thing. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1481.6s)]
*  And that's how focusing two or three times a day only on that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1482.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1485.68s)]
*  And that's how you get rid of it. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1486.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1487.68s)]
*  You simply work. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1488.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1489.68s)]
*  But it's a lot of catch up to do. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1490.68s)]
*  And there was always an issue in the early days of the UFC where those guys were the [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1491.68s)]
*  elite strikers. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1495.76s)]
*  They just didn't want to roll because when they rolled, they would get dominated. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1496.76s)]
*  But when they strike with people, they would dominate them. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1500.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1502.56s)]
*  And it's stupid. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1503.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1504.56s)]
*  It's just an ego thing. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1505.56s)]
*  Do what you don't like. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1506.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1507.56s)]
*  That's, you know, because that's most of the time. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1508.56s)]
*  First of all, you don't like it because you don't understand it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1509.56s)]
*  That's what I say to people. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1511.08s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1512.08s)]
*  Once you understand it, you know, you're going to love it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1513.08s)]
*  Like the submissions, when you once I got it, I go like, oh, this is way worse than [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1515.4s)]
*  boxing. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1520.0s)]
*  We thought the tough guys were boxers and kickboxers. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1521.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1523.08s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1524.08s)]
*  No. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1525.08s)]
*  But I think any joint bone in the human body, that's a big power to have for any guy can [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1526.3999999999999s)]
*  do that who's doing after a blue belt, so to say. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1531.0s)]
*  Well, it's just the I mean, boxing has amazing knockouts, but it's just when a guy can control [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1534.56s)]
*  you on the ground and dominate you on the ground, you don't have the same ability to [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1540.32s)]
*  defend yourself. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1545.04s)]
*  You don't have the same options. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1546.1999999999998s)]
*  There's just so much going on. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1548.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1549.9199999999998s)]
*  It's like, I mean, it's boxing is great to watch. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1550.9199999999998s)]
*  You watched the Lomachenko. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1554.92s)]
*  I did. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1555.92s)]
*  We were busy. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1556.92s)]
*  He got robbed. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1557.92s)]
*  He got robbed. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1558.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1559.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think he got robbed. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1560.92s)]
*  I mean, the commentators were trying very hard not to say he got robbed. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1561.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1564.48s)]
*  They were dancing around close rounds and this now, but I didn't I didn't see it at [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1565.48s)]
*  all. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1569.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1570.44s)]
*  I felt like Lomachenko won that decision. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1571.44s)]
*  I'd like to go back and watch again, like with silence and just sort of try to no commentary, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1572.44s)]
*  just try to like really score each round. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1578.3999999999999s)]
*  But to me, I felt like it was two rounds up for Lomachenko. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1580.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1583.24s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1584.24s)]
*  You know, guys like that. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1585.24s)]
*  It happens all the time in boxing. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1586.24s)]
*  It happens all. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1589.16s)]
*  But it happens in the UFC, too. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1590.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1592.0s)]
*  But boxing, it's worse there, right? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1593.0s)]
*  It is sometimes. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1595.2s)]
*  But when Marlon Vera fought Corey Sanhagen, one of the judges gave the fight to Marlon [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1597.32s)]
*  Vera and it makes zero sense. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1604.44s)]
*  I have watched that over and over again to try, like, because Corey Sanhagen's performance [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1607.08s)]
*  is fucking phenomenal. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1611.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's an animal. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1612.6s)]
*  It's top level. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1615.04s)]
*  And Vera is very freaking tough. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1616.04s)]
*  Vera is an animal. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1617.04s)]
*  Like animal, yeah. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1618.04s)]
*  He's a fucking animal. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1619.04s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1620.04s)]
*  They're they're the elite of the elite in that division, both top five guys. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1621.04s)]
*  But Corey just fucking just chopping away at him, doing whatever he wants, man. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1625.04s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1631.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1632.6s)]
*  Guys like that, man. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1633.6s)]
*  That's why we have guys like Israel Adesanya. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1634.6s)]
*  For him to lose and then to come back, you see, I think that's more powerful than any [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1638.1599999999999s)]
*  other person out there. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1643.12s)]
*  You know, you can be on the field. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1644.36s)]
*  It's nice, Danny, but you know, show people you're human and coming back from that. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1645.52s)]
*  And then there was rope doping, right? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1649.52s)]
*  I mean, and my body right away sits next to me, goes, he's rope doping. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1651.2399999999998s)]
*  You know, he's cage doping, whatever you want to call it, fence doping. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1655.4799999999998s)]
*  But he was still looking just for the right moment. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1659.0s)]
*  Oh, it was amazing. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1661.2399999999998s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1662.2399999999998s)]
*  Well, he had gotten very close to stopping him in one of the kickboxing fights and then [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1663.36s)]
*  dropped him with seconds to go, like one second to go in the first round of their MMA fight. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1669.16s)]
*  So he kind of knew he could get to him. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1674.52s)]
*  But it's that motherfucker so big. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1677.56s)]
*  Dude, he was standing next to me. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1679.32s)]
*  He came to karate combat. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1680.8s)]
*  He's like 235 pounds. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1682.52s)]
*  He's huge. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1684.56s)]
*  All these guys. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1686.84s)]
*  I'm next to Jones. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1687.84s)]
*  I mean, a freaking Tito. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1689.56s)]
*  But he's giant. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1693.16s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1694.16s)]
*  It's all length. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1695.16s)]
*  Ian Gary. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1696.16s)]
*  I mean, he's standing next to him. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1697.16s)]
*  He's so tall. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1698.16s)]
*  Dude, that's a fun guy too, I suppose. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1699.16s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1701.16s)]
*  Undefeated, so confident and so intelligent. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1702.16s)]
*  You know, beating Daniel Rodriguez like that in his last fight and being the first guy [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1705.72s)]
*  to stop Rodriguez. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1708.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's a big deal. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1709.8400000000001s)]
*  Look at that kick. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1711.2s)]
*  He's got it, man. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1712.2s)]
*  He's got it, whatever it is. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1713.2s)]
*  You know, he's got it and he's on his way up. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1714.56s)]
*  That's the thing, the it thing. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1717.04s)]
*  What is the it thing, right? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1718.38s)]
*  How many fighters do you see, they constantly go for the belt, go for the belt, but they [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1720.2s)]
*  never really get the belt. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1724.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's so weird. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1725.44s)]
*  You go like, man, he should be a champ. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1726.44s)]
*  But somehow he's not. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1728.96s)]
*  Well, there's guys that are so close. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1730.76s)]
*  They're so close and they beat top guys, but they never get whatever it is. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1733.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1739.68s)]
*  Michael Johnson just got knocked out this past weekend. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1740.68s)]
*  I mean, he knocked out Dustin Poirier, KO'd him with one left hand. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1743.36s)]
*  He's the elite of the elite. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1748.2s)]
*  And just at a certain point, and he's been KO'd real bad. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1749.44s)]
*  Josh Emmett KO'd him really bad. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1752.96s)]
*  And then this past weekend gets KO'd really bad again. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1755.3999999999999s)]
*  So it's a shame. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1757.8799999999999s)]
*  And everybody's focus is on that. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1760.72s)]
*  And I go like, you shouldn't keep. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1762.72s)]
*  I remember there was a time that I was 11 fights undefeated and somebody told me, he [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1764.92s)]
*  says, well, man, you're 11 and 0 right now. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1769.56s)]
*  You lost 11. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1772.1599999999999s)]
*  I go, oh, crap. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1772.92s)]
*  He goes, what? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1774.24s)]
*  I wish you wouldn't have said that. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1774.72s)]
*  I was afraid it was going to go inside my head. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1777.44s)]
*  And I go, I want to make it tough. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1779.28s)]
*  And then you start fighting not to lose. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1780.6s)]
*  You start not taking risk anymore. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1782.32s)]
*  Thankfully, I forgot about it. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1783.8799999999999s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1788.0s)]
*  You've got this very tentative guy. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1789.12s)]
*  It happens to people. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1791.2s)]
*  A lot of people. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1792.4s)]
*  They change up their style. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1792.92s)]
*  They become more technical or more boring or more safe or whatever you want to call it. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1794.68s)]
*  But they do and they think about it. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1800.0s)]
*  Mike Perry in the audience, Andre Olowsky was there also for the credit comedy thing. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1803.1200000000001s)]
*  Mike Perry, that's one of those guys. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1809.16s)]
*  If you're a promoter, grab that guy. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1811.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, my god. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1814.1200000000001s)]
*  Great on the microphone, great interviews. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1814.8400000000001s)]
*  He's either going to get knocked out or he's going to knock somebody out. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1817.24s)]
*  He will roll the dice. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1820.56s)]
*  He's the perfect guy for any organization. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1822.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, what he's doing now in bare knuckle fighting is amazing. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1824.56s)]
*  Knocking out Luke Perry like that, stopping him, beating up Michael Vinn and Page. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1828.56s)]
*  Who saw that coming? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1834.0s)]
*  He's just so fucking tough that there's something about the pain that comes with bare knuckle [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1835.72s)]
*  that just suits him. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1842.28s)]
*  It's a mental thing. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1843.48s)]
*  100%. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1844.44s)]
*  I think also we were talking about, Louis Rocha actually was talking about as the light [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1845.2s)]
*  ray guy from credit comedy. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1850.56s)]
*  He said, I'm going to win this fight because I've been in a lot of street fights. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1851.44s)]
*  I have a different mentality than his opponent, Bruno Suza. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1856.12s)]
*  He has a nice upbringing. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1859.1999999999998s)]
*  He's a great fighter, but he doesn't have that little meanness in him at the moment [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1860.2399999999998s)]
*  when you need it to control aggression like Bruce Lee would talk about. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that's a big thing as well. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1869.4799999999998s)]
*  It's certainly a big thing. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1871.6799999999998s)]
*  Skill is everything, right? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1872.8799999999999s)]
*  But then the mental aspect of it, sometimes Trump's skill, if you could overcome those [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1874.84s)]
*  moments where the opponent is beating you, if you could just find your openings and then [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1882.6s)]
*  put it on them. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1887.32s)]
*  Some people are great when they're the hammer and not so great when they're the nail. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1888.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1892.48s)]
*  I was talking with George as well, bringing your fans. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1893.48s)]
*  First time my mom and dad are here watching me fight, they go, I don't know if that's [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1896.96s)]
*  a good thing. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1900.48s)]
*  Could be really good. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1901.48s)]
*  Children is what gets me. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1902.96s)]
*  Oh, the worst. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1903.96s)]
*  Yeah, children, when you see people bring their children, you have so much to think [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1905.28s)]
*  about. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1909.52s)]
*  There's more now that you have to think about. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1910.6s)]
*  I wouldn't let my kids watch. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1912.56s)]
*  They could watch the replay, but they can't watch it live. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  Because what if something goes wrong? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1917.04s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1918.6399999999999s)]
*  And my daddy going down there, it's just not a good thing. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1919.6399999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1923.2s)]
*  And it's also, there's one more variable that you have to keep in your mind while you're [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1924.2s)]
*  competing. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1929.72s)]
*  I mean, some people can do it great. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1930.72s)]
*  Some people can fight great with their kids in the audience. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1933.56s)]
*  More power to them. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1936.72s)]
*  For some people, you watch them with the kid in the audience and they lose and they get [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1937.72s)]
*  KO'd and you see the kid crying like, oh my goodness, why would you subject your children [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1942.6000000000001s)]
*  to that? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1947.8s)]
*  It's just, it's so hard. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1948.8s)]
*  If you've just been training for three years full to become an MMA champion, that is gone. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1949.8s)]
*  Did you see the Mackenzie Dern fight this weekend? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1954.68s)]
*  No, I heard. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1958.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1959.44s)]
*  She's unbelievable, right? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1960.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1961.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1962.44s)]
*  It was incredible. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1963.44s)]
*  It was a breakthrough performance. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1964.44s)]
*  She's always been elite in the strawweight division, but to do that to Angela Hill, who [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1965.44s)]
*  is by the way, Angela Hill is so fucking tough. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1971.64s)]
*  Great striker. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1975.16s)]
*  The beating that she took in this fight never quit. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1976.16s)]
*  She came very close to getting arm bars and she just would not fucking give that arm up [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1979.8s)]
*  and she's getting hammer fisted in the face. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1984.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1986.92s)]
*  Woo. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1987.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1988.92s)]
*  She's, Angela Hill is so fucking tough, but Mackenzie Dern, my God. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1989.92s)]
*  You never expected to. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1993.96s)]
*  If you see an interview, you go, she's a sweet lady. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1995.48s)]
*  But her daughter was there for the first time and her daughter is very young and her daughter [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=1998.92s)]
*  saw her face. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2002.64s)]
*  Her daughter is crying. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2003.64s)]
*  I mean, she won. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2004.64s)]
*  She dominated. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2005.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2006.64s)]
*  But the daughter was like, it's hard. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2007.64s)]
*  It's hard in those little kids. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2008.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2010.96s)]
*  Don't bring family. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2011.96s)]
*  My wife, I wouldn't bring, because she would throw in the towel if she sees a little tiny [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2012.96s)]
*  cut, she'll throw in the towel. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2016.1200000000001s)]
*  I brought her to, okay, she takes a sit. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2018.16s)]
*  So I go into Japan. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2020.1200000000001s)]
*  I had to fight twice in one month, right? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2021.1200000000001s)]
*  As I tell her, I said, why don't you come with me? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2023.12s)]
*  I can stay there finally against some trading partners in Japan that I can roll around with [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2025.08s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2029.68s)]
*  So the first fight goes against Suzuki. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2030.68s)]
*  Peter Earth was there because he was just fighting also for the K-1 and he came to watch [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2033.3999999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2037.1599999999999s)]
*  I was the first guy to stop Suzuki at the time. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2038.1599999999999s)]
*  But I remember when I need him and I hit him and he's ghosted out on the ground. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2040.52s)]
*  I'm standing in my corner, it's an eight count, and my wife is walking away. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2044.56s)]
*  And I go, where is she going? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2049.04s)]
*  And I go, fight again. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2051.2799999999997s)]
*  And later on I go, what were you doing? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2052.52s)]
*  She says, I didn't like it because I thought you were going to hurt him a little bit because [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2054.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm there. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2057.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, you're going to do your extra very best to hurt the guy more. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2058.6400000000003s)]
*  I go, no. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2061.5600000000004s)]
*  Why the hell would you leave? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2062.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm standing there and I just see her walking away. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2064.5600000000004s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2067.5600000000004s)]
*  I go, what the hell is going on here? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2068.5600000000004s)]
*  She thought you were going to hurt him more because she was there. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2069.5600000000004s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2072.32s)]
*  And then, by the way, this is also funny. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2073.32s)]
*  We're doing the laundry. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2075.48s)]
*  She's hanging laundry on the balcony. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2076.48s)]
*  It is in Japan, in Tokyo. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2077.96s)]
*  And I suddenly go, oh my God, somebody jumped on the building. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2081.4s)]
*  And I'm laughing and I think it's a joke. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2084.6800000000003s)]
*  She goes, no, no, really. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2086.6400000000003s)]
*  So I'm looking and there's this guy on the floor in a really bad position. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2088.1200000000003s)]
*  You know that he committed suicide. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2091.76s)]
*  He just jumped. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2094.1200000000003s)]
*  And then you see people coming by. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2095.2400000000002s)]
*  They just kick him. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2096.96s)]
*  They keep walking. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2097.96s)]
*  And then suddenly there's this little ambulance thing comes. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2099.4s)]
*  They grab him up, put him away. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2102.32s)]
*  It was the wildest thing. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2104.36s)]
*  So she saw him jump? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2105.36s)]
*  She saw him falling down. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2106.36s)]
*  Whoo. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2109.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's a wild way to go. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2110.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2112.88s)]
*  They say that the moment they jump, they know it's a mistake. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2113.88s)]
*  That one guy who jumped off the bridge in New York. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2117.92s)]
*  San Francisco. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2121.6800000000003s)]
*  San Francisco. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2122.6800000000003s)]
*  And he survived. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2123.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2124.6800000000003s)]
*  The freaking, what's it, the flipper brought him back up, right? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2125.6800000000003s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2128.96s)]
*  He said you regret it the moment you step off. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2129.96s)]
*  And I... [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2132.08s)]
*  Of course. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2133.08s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2134.08s)]
*  You know you're going to die. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2135.08s)]
*  I mean, I had a friend who did that in San Francisco. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2136.08s)]
*  And he died? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2139.92s)]
*  He died. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2140.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2141.92s)]
*  He struggled with depression for a long time. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2142.92s)]
*  And then someone sent me a message that Tony killed himself. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2145.0s)]
*  I was like, oh no. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2148.96s)]
*  And I was like, how did he do it? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2150.96s)]
*  And they're like, he jumped off the bridge. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2151.96s)]
*  I was like, oh. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2152.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2153.96s)]
*  Because that's about how, that's at least 50 seconds. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2154.96s)]
*  Oh. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2157.96s)]
*  This is a whole long bridge. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2158.96s)]
*  That's a big fucking drop. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2159.96s)]
*  And you don't die instantly, I don't think either. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2160.96s)]
*  Maybe you do. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2163.96s)]
*  I see these commercials on TV where people are depressed. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2164.96s)]
*  In the early days I would be, come on man, just think happy thoughts. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2168.04s)]
*  That's what I literally, I'm the idiot who thought that. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2172.32s)]
*  And then after my last fight, I had like a two and a half month period of depression. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2174.64s)]
*  Most scariest thing I've ever had. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2179.6s)]
*  Which fight? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2180.6s)]
*  Which fight was it? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2181.6s)]
*  There was after, 2006, the last fight I made, like after seven years I didn't fight against [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2182.6s)]
*  Ruben Valerio, the big Indian guy. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2185.88s)]
*  That fight, you had depression after that fight? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2188.68s)]
*  After that, I think maybe because it was literally God letting me know, okay, the fight is over [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2190.64s)]
*  I was so injured. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2195.7200000000003s)]
*  And I thought I was okay, but I was so injured I couldn't continue fighting anymore. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2197.28s)]
*  And I think, I don't know, were you injured going into the fight? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2201.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, everything. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2204.52s)]
*  Hamstring, my rib was out. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2206.0s)]
*  It was not good. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2208.2000000000003s)]
*  But thankfully I got him. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2209.96s)]
*  But then afterwards I think that maybe got in my head that I couldn't, that this was [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2212.04s)]
*  it. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2215.48s)]
*  And I was literally on the freeway thinking, you know, what if I drive my car against it? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2216.48s)]
*  You know, and I go, what? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2220.6800000000003s)]
*  What am I thinking? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2222.36s)]
*  I go. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2223.36s)]
*  And then I decided to make a list with all the good things in my life and all the bad [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2224.88s)]
*  things. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2227.56s)]
*  And then you're going to realize that the bad thing list is two things. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2228.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2231.76s)]
*  And the rest is like, goes on, the good things. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2232.76s)]
*  And I started focusing on it. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2235.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2236.6400000000003s)]
*  A lot of people, it's harder for them, you know, and they are going to need medication. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2237.6400000000003s)]
*  I tried medication and you know, like I was freaking out. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2241.32s)]
*  I literally was thinking, if I wouldn't have had a family, I might have done it. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2244.6800000000003s)]
*  It was that crazy. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2248.96s)]
*  Did you get hit in that fight, bad? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2250.4s)]
*  No. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2252.84s)]
*  So did you get hit at all in training that was bad? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2254.32s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2256.92s)]
*  I never had an eight count, not even in fighting. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2258.2400000000002s)]
*  So I've never had, I've been very blessed. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2261.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2264.36s)]
*  So do you think it was just psychological? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2265.36s)]
*  Because that is a thing that happens to guys with CTE. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2267.7200000000003s)]
*  Guys that have had a lot of hits to the head, they start getting very depressed because [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2270.8s)]
*  their serotonin levels are all fucked up, their endocrine system is all fucked up, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2276.0s)]
*  their pituitary gland gets damaged. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2279.6400000000003s)]
*  They say it gets damaged even when you don't even get knocked out, just little jabs to [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2282.08s)]
*  the face. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2286.68s)]
*  Oh, listen, I've been training with Peter, Pedro Hezo. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2287.68s)]
*  That's a fun guy to spar with. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2290.4s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2292.2s)]
*  You know, he got me on a body shot one time and I was looking at the clock, making sure [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2293.2s)]
*  that he could not see that I was looking at the clock. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2296.32s)]
*  But he had me on a liver shot. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2298.36s)]
*  I go, and then I start throwing on purpose a lot of crosses because somebody who was hurt [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2300.16s)]
*  would never do that, right? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2304.24s)]
*  So I was trying to convince him and thankfully he thought I wasn't hurt. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2306.12s)]
*  And then the bell went like, dude, I looked at him, I'm so happy you didn't touch me [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2310.48s)]
*  there like this. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2314.76s)]
*  And I wouldn't have gone down. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2316.76s)]
*  The liver is awful. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2318.12s)]
*  It's the worst. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2319.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2320.12s)]
*  When people were saying when Ryan Garcia went down against Tank Davis and people were saying [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2321.12s)]
*  he quit, I'm like, have you ever been hit there before? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2325.8s)]
*  Oh. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2328.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's... [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2329.16s)]
*  Everything just fucking phases up. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2330.16s)]
*  This is where does my love for the liver shot come from? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2334.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2337.08s)]
*  I was in a Thai boxing class getting dropped by a liver shot. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2338.08s)]
*  First class? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2340.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2341.6s)]
*  First class, I was in the Thai box, tough boxer, karate car, but my hands are here. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2342.6s)]
*  So as soon as they added punches to the face, you over commit. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2347.7599999999998s)]
*  You go too fast so you're exposing your body. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2352.0s)]
*  And I was training with Osman was his name. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2354.2s)]
*  He was in a class A fighter already, pro. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2355.88s)]
*  And he figured me out really fast. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2360.08s)]
*  And he dropped me with a liver shot and I remember asking him, I go, what is this? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2361.52s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2366.96s)]
*  I went home, I spent three and a half hours in front of a mirror. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2368.84s)]
*  Three and a half hours. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2371.88s)]
*  My wife said, you're insane. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2372.88s)]
*  I would drink a little coffee, relax, go back to the mirror. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2374.36s)]
*  Only this. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2378.12s)]
*  I was not going to drop my hands anymore. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2380.08s)]
*  And the next day I went back to the class and I just cleaned 85% of the gym. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2382.44s)]
*  They thought I played a joke on them. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2388.44s)]
*  I go, no, I spent three and a half hours in front of the freaking mirror. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2390.0s)]
*  That was not going to happen again. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2392.88s)]
*  I was a little obsessive compulsive. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2394.88s)]
*  That's the champion mindset. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2397.8s)]
*  That's the only way to do it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2398.8s)]
*  Yeah, you need that. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2399.8s)]
*  You can't have a bunch of other options of things you can do. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2400.8s)]
*  You have to be 100% all in, fully obsessed. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2403.84s)]
*  I'm thinking about a funny story when I lived in that building. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2408.6800000000003s)]
*  I used to live across the gym and I had a mixed martial, I had a Thai boxing match the [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2413.36s)]
*  next day. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2420.4s)]
*  And my neighbors, there was a stairs going up, left are the apartments and right are [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2421.4s)]
*  the apartments. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2426.48s)]
*  That wasn't the right side, they were on the left side. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2427.48s)]
*  So they have a mirror image apartment. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2428.48s)]
*  So I know everything. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2429.84s)]
*  What we have, it's a mirror image there. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2431.2400000000002s)]
*  And they were banging the music really loud. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2434.04s)]
*  And it was 10 o'clock and I go, I'll let it go until 11 o'clock, 11.30. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2436.36s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to go down and ask them. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2440.48s)]
*  So I asked them really nice if they could please stop it because I have to do something [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2442.9s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2446.76s)]
*  I didn't want to mention anything because they can only trigger something. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2447.76s)]
*  And they said, sure. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2450.6s)]
*  Close the door, turn the music up. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2452.08s)]
*  I called the cops. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2453.88s)]
*  And I tell the cops, I say, listen, this is 86A. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2455.44s)]
*  My name is Bas Roethl. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2457.64s)]
*  You can tell them that I called you. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2459.2400000000002s)]
*  So use my name. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2461.2400000000002s)]
*  But please, this has got to stop because now it's like midnight, midnight 15, you know, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2462.2400000000002s)]
*  and I need to sleep. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2467.68s)]
*  So the police comes, but you have also a little balcony. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2469.2400000000002s)]
*  It's hilarious because the police comes, music is down. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2471.84s)]
*  I'm standing on the balcony looking at them. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2476.2400000000002s)]
*  They were on one floor behind me. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2478.08s)]
*  And while the police leaves, they go, they're going, turn it up. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2480.08s)]
*  They're screaming inside and they start blasting the music again. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2485.1600000000003s)]
*  I go, OK. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2488.0800000000004s)]
*  So I put on a cap, you know, that I looked a little different, put on a jacket. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2489.0800000000004s)]
*  And I walked out down and the guy opened up and go, hey, what's up, party time. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2495.1200000000003s)]
*  And he goes, come in, come in. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2499.76s)]
*  I walk in, close the door, right behind the door is where the fuse box are. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2501.2000000000003s)]
*  And in Holland it's different. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2506.28s)]
*  In Holland they're like ceramic, the fuses, like big, they look like spark plugs. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2507.88s)]
*  Twist them in. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2512.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2513.32s)]
*  So I opened the thing and I just crushed, I stomped the whole thing and like holding [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2514.84s)]
*  the side of the door, I go, wow, the whole place goes down. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2519.32s)]
*  And they came running in the building. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2523.1200000000003s)]
*  I go, I warned you guys, but nobody came close. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2524.32s)]
*  They saw in my eyes. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2528.6400000000003s)]
*  So the reason I didn't want to go there in the first place because I couldn't, my adrenaline, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2529.76s)]
*  well, I couldn't sleep the whole freaking night because my adrenaline was so rocketing [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2534.1600000000003s)]
*  now after that whole experience. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2538.6800000000003s)]
*  Thankfully I beat him. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2541.2s)]
*  But that was the day before the fight. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2542.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2546.3999999999996s)]
*  The day before the fight, yeah. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2547.3999999999996s)]
*  When you had the day before a fight, was there anything specifically you would do to try [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2548.3999999999996s)]
*  to relax or try to calm yourself or get ready? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2553.2s)]
*  No, I always been a big thing and then later on when I started understanding breathing [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2556.9199999999996s)]
*  better, you know, like the vagus nerve to stimulate that one, no one think I was doing [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2561.96s)]
*  that. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2568.04s)]
*  This was with nerves, I use it with a low tone. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2569.04s)]
*  I go, and I let my belly vibrate. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2573.84s)]
*  Now at the time I didn't know what I was doing. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2579.92s)]
*  Short inhales with longer exhales actually stimulating the vagus nerve, you know, and [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2581.6s)]
*  other ways to stimulate the vagus nerve are also by humming and singing. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2585.16s)]
*  So I connected two of them somehow, but it made me very calm. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2588.44s)]
*  If I had with a headache, I do it the same thing, but I go higher pitch sound because [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2592.84s)]
*  then my skull vibrates. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2597.6s)]
*  And that always helps me with headache or if I'm nervous with my body. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2601.52s)]
*  So yeah, that's what I would do. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2606.68s)]
*  I would just relax and have fun. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2608.28s)]
*  Video games, you know, only comedy. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2612.04s)]
*  Nobody can say anything bad. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2614.8s)]
*  In the dressing room, we can't have aggression. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2615.96s)]
*  Everybody needs to go right away. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2618.84s)]
*  Get the guys ass. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2620.72s)]
*  I remember my last fight and my nutrition was there and he wants to hype me up. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2621.72s)]
*  So he says, can I talk to you outside? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2626.32s)]
*  It was just before like an hour before the fight. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2627.5600000000004s)]
*  He goes, listen, man, this guy tries to take food away from me. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2630.84s)]
*  Family guy. Stop right there. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2634.52s)]
*  I don't need this. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2637.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, because if I get angry, that's that's you don't want to get angry. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2637.88s)]
*  Right. You want to be in control. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2645.76s)]
*  So he says, it's interesting because some people do need that. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2647.52s)]
*  Yeah. They need to get slapped in the face. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2649.76s)]
*  Oh, far away from that. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2651.7200000000003s)]
*  My opponent is already going to try that. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2653.36s)]
*  Why would I do that? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2654.8s)]
*  Did you see how I say, try that? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2657.92s)]
*  I didn't say do that. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2659.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. Of course. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2660.48s)]
*  Slip that in there. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2661.92s)]
*  It is interesting, the different psychology. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2663.0s)]
*  Like if you are a coach, you kind of need to be a psychologist [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2665.44s)]
*  because you're dealing with all these different people, different ways. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2668.2000000000003s)]
*  Like some people, they have amazing potential, but there's just not that discipline. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2671.5600000000004s)]
*  Some people, you got to keep them out of the gym because they're training too hard. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2676.0800000000004s)]
*  They're going to overtrain. Yeah. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2678.96s)]
*  Yeah. And I always found out that it's like it's the one in the middle. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2680.76s)]
*  It literally is. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2684.2s)]
*  I think the guys with too much talent, they don't have the stamina to back it up [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2685.04s)]
*  because they're always schooling everybody in the gym. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2690.48s)]
*  Right. And nobody gives them pressure. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2692.56s)]
*  Right. You know, and then of course, but if you have the guys like [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2694.04s)]
*  the guys who are not really physically [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  blessed, yeah, but still become a freaking champ, Tim Sylvia. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2702.48s)]
*  Yes. I mean, if you see him walk, his toes are inside a little bit. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2707.08s)]
*  He's the motoric skills are not great. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2710.96s)]
*  Yeah. Pigeon toad. Freaking world champion. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2713.2799999999997s)]
*  And those guys are way harder to beat than a guy who is. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2716.52s)]
*  It's easy for them because instead of I if I have to work for something two hours [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2719.96s)]
*  and they have to work six hours for the same thing to to get to that point, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2723.3999999999996s)]
*  they don't want to let that go. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2727.3999999999996s)]
*  Those guys are the worst guys to fight. They're the toughest. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2728.56s)]
*  So it always comes with something. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2731.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's why I figured out in the middle. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2733.56s)]
*  I know I have talent, but I'm not like a BJ Penn kind of talent. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2735.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, that is like exceptional. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2739.6800000000003s)]
*  Three years black belt and then backing it up by beating three years. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2742.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, it wins the one day out, which is insane. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2745.84s)]
*  Yeah. Imagine you meet a guy. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2749.76s)]
*  You're like, what are you doing? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2752.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to go take my first jujitsu class. Oh, good luck with that. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2753.1200000000003s)]
*  Then you meet him three years later. What are you doing? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2756.56s)]
*  Oh, I just won the world championship. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2758.8s)]
*  And what in the black belt in what in jujitsu? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2760.6s)]
*  What? Yeah. And what what rank black belt? What? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2763.6s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2767.6000000000004s)]
*  Nobody even gets a black belt in three years. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2768.36s)]
*  We can prodigy. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2770.1200000000003s)]
*  I was a brown belt for eight fucking years. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2771.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2774.0400000000004s)]
*  BJ Penn was a special guy, man. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2776.1200000000003s)]
*  When people talk about goats, I feel unfortunately they leave him out of the equation. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2778.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, but if you look at BJ in his prime, when he beat Sean Shirk, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2783.36s)]
*  when when when he beat Diego Sanchez in his prime, when he was just smashing people, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2788.5200000000004s)]
*  Joe Stevenson. Yeah. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2793.4s)]
*  BJ Penn was a motherfucker. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2794.88s)]
*  Oh, I put that BJ Penn against any one hundred fifty five pounder that's ever lived. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2797.36s)]
*  Yeah. And the striking it picked up some fast go me. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2802.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2806.84s)]
*  Oh, my God. Din Thomas animal. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2808.48s)]
*  He he's he knocked down a lot of fucking people in his jujitsu was off the charts. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2810.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Off the charts. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2815.56s)]
*  BJ Penn was so fucking talented. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2817.48s)]
*  But during that period, when he was the goat, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2820.12s)]
*  what what happened was he got with Marv Marinovich and he started training insane cardio. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2823.44s)]
*  The Marinovich has had him training cardio more than anything else. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2829.4s)]
*  It was all plyometrics. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2833.68s)]
*  It was all these facts. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2835.52s)]
*  They're like, you already know how to fight. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2837.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Like the problem is endurance. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2838.92s)]
*  Let's give you the most insane gas tank. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2841.4s)]
*  And then you go out there with so much confidence because you never have to worry [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2843.56s)]
*  about keeping your foot off the gas. Yeah. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2846.68s)]
*  But what happened? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2849.04s)]
*  This sounded to me like you were setting up. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2850.4s)]
*  That's when it started. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2852.08s)]
*  That's when he won. That's what he always won. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2853.2799999999997s)]
*  But that's when he became BJ. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2856.04s)]
*  Be a mother fucker. Yeah. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2858.4s)]
*  I feel like if like you could get time machines together, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2860.88s)]
*  I would take Khabib when he beat Conor McGregor [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2864.48s)]
*  and face BJ Penn when BJ Penn fought Sean Shirk or J. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2868.16s)]
*  Penn fought Joe Stevenson or BJ Penn fought Diego Sanchez. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2873.08s)]
*  Like that BJ Penn versus that could be. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2876.52s)]
*  Holy shit. Yeah. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2879.44s)]
*  That fight gives me goosebumps just imagining it. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2882.16s)]
*  Yeah. Freaking elbows. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2884.76s)]
*  He's the split he left over to Joe Stevens's head. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2886.08s)]
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2889.2400000000002s)]
*  There was blood everywhere. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2890.12s)]
*  Remember, it was a puddle. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2891.2400000000002s)]
*  Plus, when you got him on the ground like it. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2892.76s)]
*  That ain't no picnic. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2894.88s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2897.72s)]
*  BJ Penn was fucking amazing. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2898.84s)]
*  Everybody says, you know, it feels like he's 250 pounds when you roll with him. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2900.72s)]
*  Well, his legs move like arms. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2904.48s)]
*  Yeah. He has the most insane flexibility and dexterity. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2906.92s)]
*  Yeah. This is BJ in his prime. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2911.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. Boom. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2912.6000000000004s)]
*  Flying knee KO. Look at that. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2914.36s)]
*  Dude, BJ Penn, when he was the goat, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2916.1200000000003s)]
*  when he was on top, dude, he was fucking unstoppable. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2919.1600000000003s)]
*  He was so angry, too. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2922.1200000000003s)]
*  It was the best. Yeah. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2923.52s)]
*  I mean, are they like letting what is Mario Yamasaki letting that fight go? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2925.28s)]
*  Oh, it was the end of the round. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2929.28s)]
*  That's what it was. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2930.2000000000003s)]
*  Boom. Uppercut left hook. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2931.1200000000003s)]
*  Check the timing on this knee step. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2933.48s)]
*  Boom. And he's got those Ruka shorts with the black belt on it. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2936.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2941.12s)]
*  And Sean Shirk was a fucking pit bull. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2942.2s)]
*  Oh, my God. He was on top for a long time. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2944.96s)]
*  Oh, my God. And he had incredible fitness. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2948.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, Sean Shirk was so he was like one of the first guys [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2951.2s)]
*  that had like unbelievable strength and conditioning routines. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2954.68s)]
*  And, you know, this is early days of the UFC's popularity. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2958.64s)]
*  So it's like people miss that. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2961.8s)]
*  And I feel like Anderson Silva is another one. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2964.1200000000003s)]
*  When Anderson was in his prime, Jesus Christ. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2967.0800000000004s)]
*  When Anderson knocked out Vitor with that front kick to the face. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2970.96s)]
*  Oh, jeez. Yeah. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2973.88s)]
*  When Anderson knocked out Okami, when Anderson knocked out everybody, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2975.04s)]
*  knocked out everybody for his first win. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2978.6400000000003s)]
*  And the way he the way. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2980.36s)]
*  Oh, my God. That was even. Yeah. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2982.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. There's a bunch of those guys that, unfortunately, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2985.84s)]
*  they get left out of the conversation because people see them [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2989.72s)]
*  when they've they should have quit. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2992.7599999999998s)]
*  They should have stopped fighting. Yeah. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2995.3999999999996s)]
*  That's the case with BJ. That's the case with Anderson. Yeah. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2996.8799999999997s)]
*  People see them when they should have walked away and they just [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=2999.2799999999997s)]
*  one more time or maybe they're getting a big contract. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3003.9199999999996s)]
*  Maybe with the UFC's got them, they fight and they can make half a million dollars, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3007.0s)]
*  seven hundred fifty thousand dollars, a million dollars. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3011.52s)]
*  And so, you know, it's a but, you know, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3013.72s)]
*  we all think about that short little I'm very blessed because I got a lot of injuries. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3017.76s)]
*  And that's why I stopped because everybody tells me, man, you were smart. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3022.48s)]
*  You stopped at the end of your at the peak of your career. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3025.0400000000004s)]
*  I said that was not me because I would have been a knucklehead to kept on fighting. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3027.84s)]
*  And eventually you are going to lose because you're going to fight guys [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3031.2000000000003s)]
*  who have your age. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3033.84s)]
*  You know, they get to work out five times a day, five times a week. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3035.0s)]
*  Full power. You can't. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3038.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, you have to really make sure that when you do your high outputs, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3039.48s)]
*  because otherwise you're not going to make it. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3043.7200000000003s)]
*  So thankfully, I got injuries and that's what kept my. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3045.56s)]
*  Well, you had injuries before you won the heavyweight title. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3049.52s)]
*  You had a bad neck injury when you fought TK. Oh, yeah. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3053.12s)]
*  When you fought Tio Shikosaka, you your neck was so fucked up. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3056.24s)]
*  You could barely roll. It was really bad. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3059.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was Del Golar. He threw me on my head. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3061.64s)]
*  I don't mean to try to choke that freaking guy, man. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3063.7999999999997s)]
*  He was so powerful. Yeah. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3066.64s)]
*  Oh, Darrell Golar was a fucking beast. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3069.12s)]
*  Slams me in the corner. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3072.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, no. So my neck is completely jacked up. Yeah. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3074.6000000000004s)]
*  And that's that's the same injury that got aggravated when you did. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3078.48s)]
*  What was it? Sons of Anarchy? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3083.32s)]
*  When you were doing that movie or the TV show, what was it that you did [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3085.0400000000004s)]
*  that wound up you had to get the lights out? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3088.92s)]
*  Lights out. Yeah. The TV show. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3092.32s)]
*  There was this moment that the lead actor, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3094.84s)]
*  I'm going to beat him. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3098.1600000000003s)]
*  And he says, this is not realistic. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3099.0400000000004s)]
*  This is boss, you know, we should come up with something. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3101.08s)]
*  I do something of something illegal, whatever. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3103.6s)]
*  There's other ways. There's no way I can beat this guy. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3106.68s)]
*  And I said, what about this? I jump on your back. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3109.08s)]
*  You know, I forget to put the hooks in and I slide off. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3111.04s)]
*  I spiked myself. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3113.16s)]
*  So this is all. Oh, my God. It's your idea. Yeah. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3115.24s)]
*  And then and then I'm dizzy. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3118.24s)]
*  You hit me in the throat, whatever. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3120.08s)]
*  And then you want to do that? I go, sure. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3121.4s)]
*  You know, you're invincible at that moment, you know, you think. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3124.08s)]
*  And I did it twice. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3127.7599999999998s)]
*  And it was it was just this height that I just dropped. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3128.84s)]
*  But I remember like two months later looking in the mirror [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3131.6000000000004s)]
*  and looking at my wife, I go, is my arm getting smaller? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3135.52s)]
*  This is weird. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3138.52s)]
*  And I wasn't using it because I had a lot of pain in the shoulder. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3139.76s)]
*  And then I had to do an autograph session in in Boston for the UFC, actually. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3143.2000000000003s)]
*  They flew me out. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3148.04s)]
*  And I went to the doctor. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3149.1200000000003s)]
*  I said, I got to put a cortisone shot in there. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3150.08s)]
*  There's no way I can do this weekend. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3151.8s)]
*  You know, and it puts a cortisone shot in there. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3153.32s)]
*  And so I now could use it because before I didn't use it [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3155.52s)]
*  because it was hurting and I couldn't lift my carry on luggage. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3158.6s)]
*  Freak me out. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3161.8399999999997s)]
*  I go like, oh, watch out my other hand. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3162.7999999999997s)]
*  I lift it. OK, so it's my arm. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3164.96s)]
*  Something's going on. I thought I lost all power. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3166.8399999999997s)]
*  And that's when I realized it was my freaking neck. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3169.52s)]
*  How is it coming back now? Is it nothing? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3171.68s)]
*  It's supporting muscles to doing it. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3174.52s)]
*  You know, if I left this up, you'll see, you see, it's all gone here. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3176.36s)]
*  See, oh, wow, that's crazy. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3179.96s)]
*  But it was my whole arm was like this. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3182.88s)]
*  It was a stick. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3184.68s)]
*  So I got this biceps is coming very slowly. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3185.84s)]
*  It's coming down. But literally, I started with two pounds. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3190.04s)]
*  I could pull the trigger from a gun. Really? Yeah. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3192.6400000000003s)]
*  So going this. I used to do nine one on pull ups like people. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3195.88s)]
*  I would do this in the subway with other fighters. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3200.1200000000003s)]
*  They show the pull ups again. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3202.1200000000003s)]
*  Not stretch down. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3203.32s)]
*  But from here, I could like nine more pull ups. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3204.1600000000003s)]
*  And going from that, not able to grab the freaking water out of the fridge. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3207.1600000000003s)]
*  That was scary. That was very scary. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3211.28s)]
*  And then I went from two pound curls and I'm doing 15 now. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3213.36s)]
*  And they say, oh, that's great. Yeah. Over 12 years. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3218.1200000000003s)]
*  So you went from two pound curls to 15 pound curls. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3221.8s)]
*  But like I said, it's over 12 years. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3224.1600000000003s)]
*  I got to 45. I have on my left and then the little ones. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3226.1200000000003s)]
*  I know you went to Ways to Well and they gave you some stem cells. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3228.84s)]
*  And yes, you've done some stem cells. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3233.28s)]
*  Where did you go before that? You go to Panama? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3235.32s)]
*  I did Panama before all the way back. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3237.4s)]
*  It didn't work anything for my neck injury, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3239.1600000000003s)]
*  because apparently there's a nerve blocked and it can unblock a nerve. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3241.88s)]
*  You know, it's can only do so much. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3245.88s)]
*  It's blocked because the fuse disks. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3248.76s)]
*  They have no clue. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3250.88s)]
*  Nobody can find out where it actually is located. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3251.64s)]
*  It's because it's like, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3255.52s)]
*  it's been such a long time that they simply cannot locate. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3257.6s)]
*  They tried everything with electricity and holding and it's it's stupid. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3260.48s)]
*  Somehow they cannot figure it out. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3265.0s)]
*  So so I felt really good after Panama. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3266.76s)]
*  Like physically, it's not my. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3270.1200000000003s)]
*  What is it? Cholesterol levels. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3273.8s)]
*  It was bizarre. I went from 220 because coincidentally, I just [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3275.48s)]
*  took like a blood test two weeks before I went to there. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3280.2000000000003s)]
*  And when I came back, they did another blood test. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3283.2000000000003s)]
*  It dropped 70 points, 70 points in like 10 days. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3285.1600000000003s)]
*  And it was because of the stem cells. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3290.04s)]
*  It was the one thing I was like 150 ago. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3291.92s)]
*  What? There was 220. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3294.28s)]
*  It was really bizarre. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3295.6400000000003s)]
*  And I felt really energized. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3297.2400000000002s)]
*  I remember the person who told me to go there. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3299.92s)]
*  There was going through Mel Gibson and and his sister was talking about. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3303.32s)]
*  She said, I feel energy coming out of my fingertips. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3308.2400000000002s)]
*  I go, that's a weird thing to say. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3310.8s)]
*  But then after my third session, because she had four sessions in four days, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3312.76s)]
*  I called my wife and go, oh, I know exactly what she's talking about. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3317.2000000000003s)]
*  Every morning I will wake up [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3320.76s)]
*  out of my toes and out of my fingers for six months straight. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3322.8s)]
*  Really weird, but felt really good. Wow. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3326.52s)]
*  Yeah, I've never done the Panama. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3329.4s)]
*  I've done ways too well. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3331.6s)]
*  And I did it in Santa Monica, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3332.76s)]
*  a few different places. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3336.0s)]
*  I've done stem cells, but it's healed injuries big time. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3337.48s)]
*  I had a I had a full length rotator cuff tear. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3342.08s)]
*  And when I went in Vegas, Dr. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3345.2000000000003s)]
*  Roddy McGee shot me up with mesenchymal stem cells. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3347.36s)]
*  And I went to a doctor. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3351.2400000000002s)]
*  The UFC gave me a doctor in Los Angeles. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3353.28s)]
*  And he looks at my MRI. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3355.84s)]
*  And he goes, you're going to need surgery. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3358.52s)]
*  And I go 100 percent. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3360.84s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I mean, he goes, I don't know how you're using it now. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3362.28s)]
*  And so he goes, well, let me put you through some paces. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3366.12s)]
*  Let me let me see. He goes, resist this. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3368.32s)]
*  And I just resisted it. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3369.84s)]
*  And he was like, huh? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3371.28s)]
*  He's like, resist that. I resisted that. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3372.56s)]
*  He's like, oh, he's like, OK, it's pretty strong. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3374.48s)]
*  He goes, well, you know, it's a matter of time. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3378.32s)]
*  Just, you know, you're going to you're going to need surgery. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3381.12s)]
*  So, you know, might be better to do it now, even though it hurts. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3383.32s)]
*  You've got good muscle supporting it. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3387.12s)]
*  And so that's the only reason why it's OK. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3389.72s)]
*  So I got it shot up with stem cells. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3392.04s)]
*  Six months later, I go and get an MRI. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3393.88s)]
*  The rotator cuff tear is gone. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3396.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, full length rotator cuff tear. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3398.68s)]
*  And Dr. McGee looks at me, goes, you know how fucking insane this is? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3401.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. He goes, this is insane. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3404.7999999999997s)]
*  And this was like the early days of stem cells in America, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3406.92s)]
*  where you could kind of get away with more. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3411.2799999999997s)]
*  They were doing some wild shit. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3413.2s)]
*  You've got to go to Mexico now again. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3415.7599999999998s)]
*  Like Tijuana, the the the Cellular Performance Institute, CPI down there [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3418.12s)]
*  that my friend Ed Clay and Eddie Bravo has been down there. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3423.16s)]
*  A lot of UFC fighters have been down there. You know, they they go to. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3428.6s)]
*  It's incredible. Yeah, they they fucking dose you. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3432.72s)]
*  They hit you with a lot of it. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3436.88s)]
*  And everybody I know that's gone down to that place is phenomenal. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3438.16s)]
*  Well, for the for IV, right. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3441.7999999999997s)]
*  And I had to say the next day I called him, I got it. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3443.92s)]
*  My my muscle aches are way less. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3446.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's just after one day. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3448.84s)]
*  Well, there's a definite reduction in inflammation that comes with that. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3449.88s)]
*  You know, but there's a lot of things you could do to reduce inflammation. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3453.08s)]
*  But the healing thing is just incredible. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3456.6s)]
*  And I really wish I mean, the problem is in this country, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3458.96s)]
*  you know, without just blaming people, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3462.36s)]
*  there's too much regulation when it regard to that kind of stuff. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3465.8s)]
*  And it's not because there's a lot of evidence that people get injured [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3469.76s)]
*  by stem cells. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3472.6s)]
*  I feel like there's a lot of pressure on them [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3473.8399999999997s)]
*  because there's a lot of drugs that people take when they're injured. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3476.8399999999997s)]
*  And there's a tremendous industry in those drugs. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3480.2799999999997s)]
*  Tremendous industry and anti-inflammatories is tremendous industry [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3483.64s)]
*  in the pain pills. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3487.3199999999997s)]
*  And a lot of that would be hit hard if stem cells were openly, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3488.52s)]
*  not just not just like allowed, but allowed [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3493.7999999999997s)]
*  the way they are allowing them in other countries. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3497.3199999999997s)]
*  It's everything. And they don't want that. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3500.2799999999997s)]
*  They don't want to fix you. It's fucked. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3502.0s)]
*  It's really well, it is. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3503.88s)]
*  I mean, if they could make it so that you have to take a pill once a month [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3505.36s)]
*  and that pill is worth a lot of money and they can profit off of it, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3508.96s)]
*  they'd be like all in. Yeah. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3512.72s)]
*  But this bile, I am just a giant fan of stem cells [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3514.12s)]
*  and I'm a giant fan of peptides. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3518.4s)]
*  Yeah, me too. Always the peptides makes a giant [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3520.76s)]
*  with your own body to make more. Yes, the best it is. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3523.24s)]
*  It's always better than a foreign substance in you. Yes. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3526.56s)]
*  And it's incredible what they can do now. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3529.04s)]
*  Yeah, really. And we're really at the cusp of this. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3530.8s)]
*  They're doing things now where they have stem cell eye drops [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3534.1200000000003s)]
*  for people that have eye injuries. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3537.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, the intravenous stem cells help with all sorts of neurological [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3539.88s)]
*  conditions and all sorts of issues that people have, particularly [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3543.88s)]
*  when they go to, say, Colombia, the bioaccelerator place or [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3547.1200000000003s)]
*  or Neil Reardon's place, which is in Panama. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3551.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's fucking it's amazing what they can do now. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3553.36s)]
*  So anyway, this this shoulder many years later, zero problem. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3557.7200000000003s)]
*  I do just themselves 90 pound clean presses with this cheese [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3562.1200000000003s)]
*  and I do windmills with it. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3566.0800000000004s)]
*  So I'm putting it in these compromising positions [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3567.6000000000004s)]
*  where I'm doing this with windmills with 90 pounds. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3570.5600000000004s)]
*  No problems. Zero pain. Yeah. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3572.96s)]
*  Throwing full punches, zero pain. Nice. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3575.44s)]
*  No problem. Pull a 90 pound bow back. No problem. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3578.2000000000003s)]
*  No, no issues at all. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3581.2000000000003s)]
*  And this was that close to getting cut. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3582.6000000000004s)]
*  And now it doesn't and doesn't bother me at all. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3585.44s)]
*  I mean, it's like nothing wrong with it. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3587.64s)]
*  It's so wild, right? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3590.12s)]
*  Sometimes the wildest thing that I one time had was that I had a really [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3591.48s)]
*  Oh, the little pinkie sticker because I hit somebody's hip [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3595.96s)]
*  like a karate gi hit a hip and it was before a fight. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3600.04s)]
*  So I'm arriving at the at the pancreas for fighting. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3603.28s)]
*  And the judge was the judge was a really good [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3608.2000000000003s)]
*  freaking body mechanic guy. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3612.96s)]
*  He I mean, everybody from around the world would go to that guy [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3614.44s)]
*  to have him look at him because he was just really good with [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3618.7999999999997s)]
*  Tai Chi and whatever he did. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3623.0s)]
*  What is the acupressure, all that kind of stuff. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3624.48s)]
*  And he went to me and he says, OK, give me a hand. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3626.56s)]
*  I relaxed it. And he pushed on three spots. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3629.08s)]
*  I was like, shit, shit, shit. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3631.2s)]
*  He goes, not just that, he worked it out. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3633.04s)]
*  He does it again. I go, OK, don't be says, OK, how is it now? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3634.7999999999997s)]
*  And I go like. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3638.72s)]
*  I go, it's completely gone, like zero pain, not even a hint of it. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3640.04s)]
*  And he just opened up the pain blockages that he said [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3646.7200000000003s)]
*  that he was pressing and he was on the monument. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3650.12s)]
*  He's go out and the second time was already less than the third time. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3652.7200000000003s)]
*  He says, I should be good. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3656.4s)]
*  I got so right. Nothing. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3657.48s)]
*  That's so weird. Yeah. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3660.28s)]
*  Yeah. What is it like now to rely on your left hand? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3661.8s)]
*  Because now you're thinking about if you're going to fuck somebody up, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3664.32s)]
*  you're going to left hand them. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3666.52s)]
*  You're not going to throw straight right anymore. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3667.56s)]
*  No, no, no. My priceps triceps still work. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3669.44s)]
*  Oh, no, I will knock you out. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3672.0400000000004s)]
*  And my uppercut is coming back. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3675.88s)]
*  The punches is still good. The uppercut. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3677.44s)]
*  The uppercut is a little less. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3679.36s)]
*  Yeah, a little less because of the shoulder, but the shoulder also came back. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3680.76s)]
*  Also the hook. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3683.28s)]
*  You know, I saw people when I'm doing a shadow boxing, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3684.28s)]
*  I said, don't look at my right arm because it's probably going to be a little off. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3686.88s)]
*  Look at the left what I'm doing. But no, my crosses are there. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3689.96s)]
*  So thankfully, my triceps came back. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3692.52s)]
*  Maybe in 12 more years, you'll get a full bicep. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3694.0400000000004s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3696.88s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3698.4s)]
*  Well, maybe less than anymore. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3699.4s)]
*  If I mean, if they figure out some way to fix it, I mean, it's just like the medical [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3701.0s)]
*  advances that are happening are so magical. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3706.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's really, really incredible time. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3708.44s)]
*  It doesn't stop this whole talks with Mr. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3710.88s)]
*  Kaku, you had, you know, with quantum computers and all that stuff. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3715.0s)]
*  Michio Kaku. Yeah. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3718.8s)]
*  And it's all going to be probably in our bodies, right? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3719.7200000000003s)]
*  It's something like that eventually is going to happen. Yeah. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3723.4s)]
*  What do you think about that, boss? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3727.24s)]
*  I'm very scared of that because they can hack me then. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3728.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think if you. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3731.56s)]
*  I know that's how you go right to that. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3734.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3736.96s)]
*  So I would do if I'm bad guy, I go hack him. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3737.96s)]
*  That's a real problem. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3740.6s)]
*  It's a real problem, because that's what I think the people that control the world, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3741.72s)]
*  they would genuinely genuinely like to have a one world government, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3745.48s)]
*  one economy that the entire world shares, a digital currency [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3749.8399999999997s)]
*  that goes with the social credit system. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3754.64s)]
*  So they can turn it off and on and they can do whatever the fuck they want. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3756.68s)]
*  Yeah. BJ Penn just made some some post about that. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3759.24s)]
*  If you have an electric car and you get arrested [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3763.08s)]
*  or if they're looking for you, they can literally tell your electric car [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3766.44s)]
*  to drive to the police station. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3769.6s)]
*  Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3771.8399999999997s)]
*  Fuck that. Yeah. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3774.04s)]
*  I would never go full electric. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3776.16s)]
*  I don't think it's, you know, if you get an electric, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3777.7999999999997s)]
*  but also get gas on the side. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3780.6s)]
*  I have I have an electric car that I love. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3782.56s)]
*  I have a Tesla and it's fucking magic. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3784.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The speed of that thing is magic. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3786.56s)]
*  Yeah. Two point three. Right. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3788.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, I have it's it's faster. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3789.96s)]
*  I think it's like, what is the what is the the Plaid zero to 60? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3792.24s)]
*  It's fucking insane. It's eleven hundred horsepower. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3796.08s)]
*  It's so fast. It's so fun. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3798.96s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, and it's so quiet. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3801.44s)]
*  It's just like that's my car. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3803.04s)]
*  It's my my car that I love when I just want to just when I want to drive to work [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3804.92s)]
*  and just just chill out and think and listen to music. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3808.16s)]
*  I drive that car because it just makes no sound. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3810.92s)]
*  Yeah. But super super. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3814.0s)]
*  And but it's very safe, too, in that if you have to merge on the highway, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3817.68s)]
*  you just hit the gas. Yeah. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3822.04s)]
*  It's like it's teleporting. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3824.16s)]
*  I love that car. I love it so much. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3826.6s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3829.0s)]
*  There's a lot of things that they have a weird steering wheel [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3830.12s)]
*  has the Yoke steering wheel. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3832.2s)]
*  So it's not a wheel. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3833.96s)]
*  But now they offer it in a wheel. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3834.68s)]
*  So they fix the number one problem that I have with it. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3835.96s)]
*  You still have to keep your hands on it for at least a minute. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3838.2799999999997s)]
*  Like to do auto driving. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3840.56s)]
*  Yeah, because people hang weights on it or something. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3842.8s)]
*  I don't fuck with that. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3845.48s)]
*  And I don't fuck with the auto driver. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3846.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mess around with it every now and then just for fun. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3847.8s)]
*  But I never let it drive me around. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3851.2400000000002s)]
*  I keep my hands on it. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3852.84s)]
*  You fuck around with it, Jamie. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3854.52s)]
*  You got the full auto driver. You got that beta, right? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3855.52s)]
*  Sometimes here and there, like not just for like. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3857.84s)]
*  Yeah. If I'm on a 10 minute drive, I would maybe use it for four minutes [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3860.48s)]
*  of that 10 minute drive. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3863.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not ready for prime time yet. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3864.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm not who. Yeah. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3866.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not fucking. Yeah. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3868.72s)]
*  But the thing is, the way Tesla's work, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3869.64s)]
*  Tesla has the absolute most advanced auto driving that's ever existed. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3872.56s)]
*  And they're getting information from all these vehicles [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3877.3199999999997s)]
*  and improving upon it with every iteration. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3880.68s)]
*  So they're always getting these software updates. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3883.08s)]
*  They're constantly working on it. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3885.08s)]
*  These engineers are fucking wizards. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3886.52s)]
*  And they're making it better and better. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3888.72s)]
*  And it does drive really nice. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3890.08s)]
*  But I like to drive. Yeah. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3891.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, like I drove my 1993 Porsche today. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3893.16s)]
*  It doesn't have power steering. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3897.84s)]
*  It doesn't have a radio. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3899.6800000000003s)]
*  It doesn't have air conditioning. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3901.04s)]
*  It doesn't have jack shit. Yeah. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3902.36s)]
*  And it's air cooled. It's just. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3904.2400000000002s)]
*  But it's fun. Oh, my God. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3907.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not even fast. Yeah. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3909.08s)]
*  It's so much slower than my Tesla. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3910.36s)]
*  But my God, it's a it's a visceral experience. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3912.28s)]
*  Like your whole body feels it when you drive it. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3915.96s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3917.84s)]
*  It's fun. It's exciting. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3922.1200000000003s)]
*  I love this stuff. I love it. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3924.92s)]
*  Yeah. Ninety three. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3926.88s)]
*  This is when I started fighting. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3928.2000000000003s)]
*  Imagine that. That's how long I'm a freaking fossil. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3929.6800000000003s)]
*  I remember in 90. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3932.28s)]
*  I think it was 94 or 95. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3934.44s)]
*  I watched Pedro Hizo work out at Beverly Hills Jiu Jitsu. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3937.48s)]
*  And that was when I realized how hard someone can kick you in the legs. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3941.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3945.56s)]
*  I watched him kick the heavy bag. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3946.48s)]
*  And I don't think there's ever I've never seen a human ever in all my day. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3948.12s)]
*  I've seen a lot of people kick. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3952.32s)]
*  I've never seen a human kick harder than Pedro Hizo. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3953.92s)]
*  Oh, he's an animal because he's got technique and he's got the weight. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3956.32s)]
*  And he's got these giant fucking legs. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3958.88s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, my God. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3961.76s)]
*  Yeah. Kick by him. It's not fun. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3963.36s)]
*  He was he was kicking the bag. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3965.2400000000002s)]
*  And I remember thinking, yeah, I'm one of those. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3966.76s)]
*  I remember when he fought Rico Rodriguez, he kicked Rico once. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3970.2000000000003s)]
*  And Rico was the look of his face. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3973.44s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3975.48s)]
*  I think thank heaven. Yeah, look at that. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3977.28s)]
*  He spins around. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3979.1600000000003s)]
*  To caught air. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3982.76s)]
*  Pedro Hizo, Dan Severin, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3984.44s)]
*  till he stopped dance ever with leg kicks. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3986.92s)]
*  I mean, his his fucking leg kicks were insane. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3988.88s)]
*  I mean, Randy Couture, when he fought him, like they they had to really [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3992.2400000000002s)]
*  convince Randy to to fight him a second time. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3996.12s)]
*  And, you know, he he'd battered his fucking legs. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=3999.36s)]
*  Cameron Randleman to tell him that he knocked out Josh Barnett, too. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4002.6s)]
*  And it was a lot of that his fucking Muay Thai. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4005.88s)]
*  And he was Marco Huas's prize proof. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4007.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. His number one pupil. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4010.6800000000003s)]
*  Pedro Hizo was the fucking man. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4012.64s)]
*  Oh, he's another one that people forget. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4015.44s)]
*  Pedro Hizo, his fucking leg kicks, man. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4018.6s)]
*  And I'm telling you, when I've seen so many people kick the bag, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4021.4s)]
*  no one has ever impressed me with a leg kick, a low kick on the bag [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4026.44s)]
*  like Pedro Hizo. Look at the size of his fucking leg. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4030.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, tree trunks. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4032.8399999999997s)]
*  And he just had this power that was you couldn't take them. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4034.96s)]
*  And this is before the calf kick. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4038.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, this is early days. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4040.44s)]
*  He was fucking people up with just kicking the thighs. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4041.64s)]
*  As soon as he hit you a couple of times, it was just like, oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4046.04s)]
*  Everybody was like, that's it. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4049.88s)]
*  That's it. I'm done. I'm done. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4051.16s)]
*  Please, please stop this fight. Please. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4053.2400000000002s)]
*  Referees were a little bit more lenient back then. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4057.8s)]
*  And these are fighters. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4060.2000000000003s)]
*  Imagine this happening to a person on the street. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4061.08s)]
*  Oh, if you don't know what a low kick is and you're not flexing. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4064.12s)]
*  Well, Forrest Griffin kicked a reporter. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4067.8s)]
*  He had some deal with the reporter. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4070.56s)]
*  He said, I'll do an interview with you. Let me kick your leg. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4072.68s)]
*  Oh, and he's not holding back. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4075.08s)]
*  He full power low kicked him and put a hairline fracture in this dude's tibia. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4077.08s)]
*  Oh, was it a tibia? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4081.76s)]
*  It's a special. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4083.96s)]
*  One of the one of the major bones. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4085.08s)]

*  I would rather not interview you, sir. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4117.04s)]

*  That's another one. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4208.52s)]
*  Chuck Liddell in his prime was a fucking monster. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4209.24s)]
*  Yeah, because he could take it. Yeah. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4213.68s)]

*  It was popular because of the Forrest Griffin that did that. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4232.72s)]
*  The big final between Stephen Bonner and Forrest Griffin [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4235.84s)]
*  and the ultimate fighter made the UFC. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4238.64s)]

*  Baba Lou was a fucking animal, man. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4303.0s)]
*  There's a crazy Baba Lou soccer kick knockout [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4305.679999999999s)]
*  of this really thick muscled guy. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4310.2s)]
*  Forget who the dude was, but Baba Lou cracked him and then soccer kicked him. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4313.4s)]
*  It's oh, oh, see if you can find that. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4317.96s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4322.64s)]
*  You got to give Baba Lou his props because Baba Lou was another guy, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4324.72s)]
*  a guy that people forgot. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4327.5599999999995s)]
*  There it is. Is that it? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4330.08s)]
*  Yes. I forget who the guy was. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4332.12s)]
*  So he gets it. Yeah, it's right before that. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4334.76s)]
*  Oh, I mean, with wrestling shoes on back then. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4336.44s)]
*  Yeah, because they would let guys fight with wrestling shoes. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4340.16s)]
*  Brad Kohler. Is that who it was? [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4343.5599999999995s)]
*  I forget who the guy was. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4345.96s)]
*  I think that's Brad Kohler, who was another tank. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4347.32s)]
*  God damn those early days. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4350.88s)]
*  Those early days were wild. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4352.6s)]
*  They're crazy when guys would fight with wrestling shoes on, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4354.4400000000005s)]
*  which is very interesting because, you know, you could [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4357.24s)]
*  you could do so much more with movement and with that grip from the wrestling shoes. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4361.96s)]
*  I just had an event was asked me to for a student of his to for karate combat. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4366.28s)]
*  So I went to show and he's already there. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4371.52s)]
*  I go, well, this is two months ago. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4374.72s)]
*  They already allowed you. I go, yeah, man, I'm looking forward to this. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4376.12s)]
*  But he's you can see that he's trained by Eve's, you know, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4379.64s)]
*  but he's that was also one of those guys that you should keep an eye on. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4383.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The one knockout that he did one time, Josh Thompson, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4387.76s)]
*  the jumping knee when he had the single leg. Did you ever see that? Yes. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4391.96s)]
*  I always told my students, I go, if somebody has a single leg on you, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4395.240000000001s)]
*  imagine you jump up with the same leg that you jump in the face [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4398.64s)]
*  and then land on that same foot again. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4402.72s)]
*  Yeah. Freaking Eve pulled it off. Yeah. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4404.64s)]
*  He did. Eve was elite. Yeah. Eve was elite. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4407.28s)]
*  So here. Oh, this is this is the Josh Thompson kale. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4411.12s)]
*  And this, by the way, this is when Josh Thompson was one of the best in the world. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4414.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's in a scramble. They break loose here. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4419.2s)]
*  Josh Thompson gets up and Eve catches him right here. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4423.36s)]
*  Oh, and I remember that with a jumping round kick. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4426.48s)]
*  And then Josh Thompson was the first guy to ever stop Nate Diaz. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4430.32s)]
*  Yeah, I was there. Same kid. Yeah. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4434.68s)]
*  Head kick, head kick of Nate Diaz. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4437.84s)]
*  I had a I was with Eve at an underground fight somewhere. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4439.84s)]
*  You know, the Atlantic Commission would come in first. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4446.12s)]
*  And they said, OK, there's not going to be they made up the story [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4449.6s)]
*  that's going to be just wrestling two guys are going to roll against each other. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4452.4800000000005s)]
*  As soon as they left the building, they closed the doors. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4454.96s)]
*  Is OK, everything is on. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4457.04s)]
*  And then the real fighting started. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4458.4400000000005s)]
*  And I remember I was sitting next to the cage and he's on somebody. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4460.2s)]
*  And he said, because I'm in his corner, I trained him. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4463.56s)]
*  And he started hitting the guy was just crosses, crosses, crosses. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4465.72s)]
*  I go, Eve's and he looks at me, I go left to quite straight. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4468.360000000001s)]
*  And he goes, bang, bang out. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4472.04s)]
*  And I go, I see you don't want to waste any energy. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4474.04s)]
*  But he's always funny like he goes, oh, just bomb bomb. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4477.64s)]
*  That's the nickname now. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4480.84s)]
*  Bomb bomb, bomb bomb. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4482.12s)]
*  Boss with the stairs, bomb bomb. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4483.88s)]
*  I had the story with Marco Hors. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4485.4400000000005s)]
*  We go to Eve's that was in Houston. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4486.88s)]
*  And there's this cup. I'm drinking a Heinegger outside. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4489.0s)]
*  And this little cop is there with shades on in the middle of the night. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4491.56s)]
*  You know, exactly with the pumped up black arms. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4494.8s)]
*  And he's telling me to get rid of my beer. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4497.88s)]
*  So I say, sure. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4500.360000000001s)]
*  So I start drinking the beer. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4501.72s)]
*  He says, stop drinking, stop drinking, stop drinking. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4503.320000000001s)]
*  But I finish it. I throw it away. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4504.88s)]
*  He says, I told you to get rid of the beer. I say. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4506.04s)]
*  And I just did everything. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4508.360000000001s)]
*  You want to go in and leave after it was no nice from Holland. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4510.24s)]
*  Like that's different here in America. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4512.92s)]
*  It is with drinking. It is. Yeah. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4515.28s)]
*  But anyway, the guy was angry and he left. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4518.16s)]
*  It is an outside event. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4521.16s)]
*  And there is a fence in between wherever it is. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4523.2s)]
*  And the cop now comes over. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4527.92s)]
*  He's sitting shotgun. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4529.88s)]
*  He has his arm hanging out the window with still with the shades on. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4531.32s)]
*  His partner's driving and he's just that locking me in the eyes. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4535.2s)]
*  So I moon him. Right. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4539.24s)]
*  And Marco Hors stands next to me. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4542.88s)]
*  And I go, because they start running after us. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4545.04s)]
*  He says, now we got to run. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4547.36s)]
*  And then it's just we be like the next day we wake up. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4548.599999999999s)]
*  But Marco has his whole finger is like all bandaged up [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4551.16s)]
*  and still to this day, I don't know what what happened. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4554.32s)]
*  But I said, I said to him, I said, what did you do? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4556.76s)]
*  He goes, you did that. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4560.84s)]
*  Apparently I did it, but he never said what it was. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4563.08s)]
*  But you did that. I did it. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4565.92s)]
*  But he didn't tell you what he had to do. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4567.5599999999995s)]
*  He did not do it. He did not tell me. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4568.84s)]
*  He didn't want to incriminate himself. Maybe it's too dark. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4570.2s)]
*  Oh, here's the flying. This is this. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4572.08s)]

*  Yes. That's right over there was crazy. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4583.6s)]
*  That was interesting, right? Because that wasn't that CBS. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4586.56s)]
*  I think it was CBS. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4590.04s)]
*  Yeah, which was like early, early days. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4591.56s)]
*  And they took a wild chance. Yeah. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4594.68s)]

*  But didn't he win before he was the wild card or something that you see before? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4654.08s)]
*  Think so. I think Kimbo back in the day. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4658.48s)]

*  It was just fucking incredibly tough and had wild cardio [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4680.5599999999995s)]
*  and really knew how to like [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4684.599999999999s)]
*  extend himself in like a real war. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4688.879999999999s)]
*  And this was a crazy fight. The end of it. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4692.08s)]
*  Look at the face. Oh, he dazed him. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4694.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Sean Gannon, at the end of this, his face was like completely hematoma. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4697.36s)]
*  Yeah. So he got this guillotine. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4703.16s)]
*  And they said they couldn't fight in the ground. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4704.88s)]
*  No, there were no jokes about that. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4706.96s)]
*  But they didn't say anything about standing up. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4707.92s)]
*  There was like a lot of dispute about whether or not that was OK. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4709.76s)]
*  Why are they blurring out the back of his shirt? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4712.48s)]
*  Probably middle fingers or something. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4714.32s)]
*  Logos that they probably got in trouble for wearing. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4716.2s)]
*  Mm hmm. Probably. Yeah. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4718.8s)]
*  Once you let this go. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4721.2s)]
*  So this guy goes in. Look at this is Kimbo's people are. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4722.84s)]
*  They're trying to separate this because there's like some dispute [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4725.92s)]
*  as to whether or not a standing guillotine constitutes grappling. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4730.04s)]
*  You know, so then Kimbo gets him on the ground. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4736.4800000000005s)]
*  Now, Kimbo's violating the rules because he's trying to ground and pound him. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4738.68s)]
*  And Sean pushes him off, Sean gets back up to his feet, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4743.360000000001s)]
*  and then they they go back to war. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4746.320000000001s)]
*  And so they were giving them 30 counts, not a 10 count, but a 30 count, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4748.2s)]
*  because at one point in time, oh, that liver shot. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4754.12s)]
*  Oh, that was nice. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4756.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Nice liver shot. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4757.599999999999s)]
*  And especially because he's south. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4758.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, it's a long. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4759.88s)]
*  As Bill Spence says that. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4761.32s)]
*  You can see he's hurting from it. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4762.679999999999s)]
*  He's hurting from he's trying to shake it off. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4764.08s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, again. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4765.5599999999995s)]
*  Again. There it is. There it is. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4767.24s)]
*  It's the liver, the boss root and special. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4769.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And so this fight went on for shit. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4772.72s)]
*  I don't know how many minutes. Yeah. Long time. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4776.08s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4777.88s)]
*  And the pace. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4780.12s)]
*  Yeah. And so the the like when he knocks him down, he drops him. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4781.400000000001s)]
*  And so Kimbo goes down and then they start the count. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4786.64s)]
*  They separate him. They pulled Sean off of him. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4789.64s)]
*  There's a lot of people involved in this. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4791.8s)]
*  And then they give Kimbo like 30 seconds to get back. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4793.88s)]
*  Look how long they give it. Play this out, please. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4798.28s)]
*  So they separate them. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4801.12s)]
*  17, 18, 19, 20, 21. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4803.08s)]
*  Oh, look, Sean's face is so fucked up. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4811.84s)]
*  They're blurring his face. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4814.04s)]
*  Look how fucked up his face is. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4815.76s)]
*  And he gets back up. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4819.04s)]
*  Oh, come on. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4821.36s)]
*  It was over. It was over. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4823.48s)]
*  Crazy. The early days. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4827.6s)]
*  Those were the days. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4831.0s)]
*  See, if Kimbo was around now in bare knuckle boxing, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4834.68s)]
*  he'd have a place that would have been his freaking jam. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4839.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, you know, it's interesting. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4842.72s)]
*  Houston Alexander's made a resurgence. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4844.6s)]
*  Oh, Houston Alexander. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4846.92s)]
*  And he's doing great to write in four fights in bare knuckle boxing. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4848.32s)]
*  And I think he's 50. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4851.96s)]
*  Geez, he's a fucking and he's a radio DJ. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4853.92s)]
*  He just won 51, 51, 51. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4858.44s)]
*  51. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4860.72s)]
*  Houston Alexander, man. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4862.56s)]
*  When Houston Alexander burst onto the scene in the UFC, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4864.64s)]
*  he was starching people. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4867.52s)]
*  51 year old Houston Alexander survives brutal rib roasting, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4869.96s)]
*  remains undefeated in bare knuckle boxing. Incredible. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4873.16s)]
*  And Houston, when he first fought in the UFC, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4876.16s)]
*  God, what was his first fight? Was it? [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4879.16s)]
*  Oh, who did he fight? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4882.2s)]
*  Says he knocked out Keith Jardine in 2007. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4884.76s)]
*  Right. Pulled that fight up. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4886.92s)]

*  Think of that. Yeah. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4896.96s)]
*  Think of that 16 years ago. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4898.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's fighting MMA. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4902.44s)]
*  And when nobody had known him, nobody knew who he was. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4904.4s)]
*  And he was a radio DJ. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4907.4s)]
*  And everybody was like, look at this guy, all jacked and muscular, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=4910.36s)]

*  But the Coca leaves. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5003.16s)]

*  Everybody that fought him said hitting him is like hitting metal. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5007.44s)]
*  Yeah. And they all say he's using it. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5010.24s)]

*  Well, he was a part of the Cuban program. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5016.4s)]
*  So this sounds really no one really knows what they did with him when he was young. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5020.68s)]
*  Oh, for real. Yes. Here's the thing. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5025.2s)]
*  I've told the story before. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5027.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, I'll tell it again for other people who haven't heard it. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5028.08s)]
*  He got he fought for the UFC and then they brought him to a doctor. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5031.280000000001s)]
*  He had a fractured orbital and they brought him to a doctor. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5035.280000000001s)]
*  And the doctor calls the UFC and goes, where did you get this guy? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5039.0s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, he's amazing, right? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5043.0s)]

*  Because I think they took some pages out of the Russians, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5063.52s)]
*  like when they created Alexander Karelin. Yeah. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5065.52s)]
*  Because Karelin, this is a freaking animal. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5068.400000000001s)]
*  Karelin, who's there's a photo of my gym out there of Karelin. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5070.88s)]

*  Because it's Karelin. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5077.200000000001s)]
*  He's lifting this guy up in the air. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5079.280000000001s)]
*  Find that photo of Karelin, because it's fucking wild. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5081.08s)]
*  That photo. I have a giant photo of that in the gym out there. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5084.360000000001s)]
*  Look at that motherfucker. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5087.88s)]
*  It's scary. It was like six to 300 pounds and he moved like a cat. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5089.8s)]
*  Yeah. And he would he was famous for hoisting people up in the air [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5095.32s)]
*  and fucking slamming them on the ground. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5099.16s)]
*  People would lay flat on the floor and he would still suplex him. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5101.04s)]
*  Go to Alexander Karelin highlight. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5105.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they were just terrified. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5107.400000000001s)]
*  His wrestling was so different because he was killing you with the ground. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5109.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. He was smashing you into the ground. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5113.4400000000005s)]
*  He was basically beating you up with the ground. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5115.84s)]
*  Yeah. Everybody else is trying to wrestle. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5117.88s)]
*  He was trying to pound you in the ground. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5119.96s)]
*  I mean, undefeated up until he fought Rulon Garner. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5123.280000000001s)]
*  Look at this. The athleticism that this guy had. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5126.96s)]
*  It was crazy. Look at the size of that motherfucker. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5129.8s)]
*  By the way, the idea that he's clean is just shut the fuck up. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5133.6s)]
*  Just stop. Just let that all go. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5137.72s)]
*  Who cares? Just look what's possible. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5141.2s)]
*  Look what's possible with Russian science and technique. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5143.52s)]
*  Obviously, the technique was stellar, too. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5146.84s)]
*  But the the training, the discipline, everything. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5149.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. This guy was a motherfucker, dude. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5153.0s)]
*  Look at that. Boom. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5156.320000000001s)]
*  And these are 270 pound men, big men, heavyweights. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5158.240000000001s)]
*  And he was so fucking terrifying. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5162.64s)]
*  Amazing. What happened with the Rulon Garner thing? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5167.88s)]
*  There was he I know he beat him, but it was something. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5170.4800000000005s)]
*  It was a new rule. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5173.2s)]
*  The new rule was it's Greco-Roman. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5174.44s)]
*  And the new rule is if you could separate the grip, it was one point. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5177.16s)]
*  And he said Rulon separated his grip. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5180.599999999999s)]
*  OK, that rule didn't exist before then. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5182.8s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything. Yeah. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5185.44s)]
*  They gave him a point for that. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5187.16s)]
*  I guess it's because there wasn't enough points being scored in some of the matches. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5188.4s)]
*  Yeah. So they changed this. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5192.0s)]
*  They didn't change it for Rulon. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5193.4s)]
*  They just changed it in Rulon one. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5194.92s)]
*  And Rulon was another beast. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5196.679999999999s)]
*  Listen, that his story is like a plane crash. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5198.08s)]
*  Everybody's dead. He swims to the shore. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5201.28s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5204.28s)]
*  Oh, dude, he almost lost his foot frostbite. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5205.5199999999995s)]
*  Everything survives. Everything. This guy. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5207.8s)]
*  That was a different thing. Right. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5209.599999999999s)]
*  The frostbite was a snowmobile accident. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5210.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, I thought it was from the swimming back to the shore. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5212.5599999999995s)]
*  I think I think crashed with Rulon. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5215.32s)]
*  The the thing was the so Rulon was also an enormous country fed motherfucker. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5217.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Who was a hell of a wrestler, hell of a wrestler. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5224.32s)]
*  And he went off to fight in pride. Remember? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5226.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But that's what I mean. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5229.36s)]
*  I helped him with Ryan Parsons. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5230.5599999999995s)]
*  That's why I was in the corner. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5232.839999999999s)]
*  That's where you heard these crazy stories. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5233.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And that was zero zero. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5236.4s)]
*  And then Rulon got him to separate the grip at one point in time. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5238.5199999999995s)]
*  And that was it. You find it? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5243.2s)]
*  I think that was it. That was it. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5244.799999999999s)]
*  That was it. He just won. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5246.5599999999995s)]
*  And then when they come back, he's up one zero. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5247.719999999999s)]
*  So yeah, interesting. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5249.5199999999995s)]
*  So they went to the tape to check about his grip here. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5251.48s)]
*  So he gets their arms above the shoulders first, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5254.92s)]
*  oh, right there. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5259.32s)]
*  He just just changed his hands. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5261.44s)]
*  That's crazy. That's crazy. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5275.12s)]
*  And that's a great Jeff Blatnick doing commentary. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5278.04s)]
*  Yeah. Good guys. Rest in peace. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5280.36s)]
*  The nicest son is a nice guy. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5283.12s)]
*  The nice instrumental. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5285.24s)]
*  Also in the rules to get him a big John. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5287.2s)]
*  Yeah. Instrumental also in bringing credibility to the UFC, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5289.52s)]
*  because here you have this guy who's this Olympic wrestler, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5293.28s)]
*  is an elite wrestler who is embracing MMA and talking about how important it is. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5295.68s)]
*  Yeah. And this is what they would do. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5302.64s)]
*  They would flatten out. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5303.96s)]
*  Gardner was hanging in there in the. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5305.68s)]
*  Yeah, Rulon, like you said, he's a freaking animal to him. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5308.0s)]
*  And these are special human beings. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5310.76s)]
*  Why don't you go to the Olympics? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5312.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, you're freaks. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5314.28s)]
*  One point in Rulon Gardner, gold medalist. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5316.719999999999s)]
*  Wow. And then he went off to fight in Pride. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5319.5199999999995s)]
*  And when he was fighting in Pride, he was jabbing people, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5322.5199999999995s)]
*  just fucking hitting them with that giant canned ham fist of his. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5325.08s)]
*  Yeah. Boom, boom. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5328.84s)]
*  I'm just thinking about the karate car who won the gold medal by getting knocked out. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5331.32s)]
*  You remember the last Olympics? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5337.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. Imagine you wake up and say, what happened? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5340.0s)]
*  You're the world champion, dude. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5343.2s)]
*  Because in karate, you're not in the Olympics. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5344.96s)]
*  You're not supposed to hit him hard. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5347.0s)]
*  But he bumped into it when you saw it. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5348.64s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5350.48s)]
*  It's just karate combat. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5351.96s)]
*  Tried to have those guys fighting full contact in the karate combat cage. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5352.96s)]
*  So unfortunately, it didn't happen. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5357.16s)]
*  So this dude, he went right into that kick and he lost because of that in 2020, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5359.5199999999995s)]
*  which is insane. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5365.56s)]
*  I mean, it literally makes zero sense. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5368.2s)]
*  Insane. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5371.6s)]
*  Yeah, because he bumped into it. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5372.76s)]
*  That's 100% legal. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5375.16s)]
*  100. And look at this. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5376.400000000001s)]
*  He's got the COVID mask on too. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5377.400000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5379.04s)]
*  Remember that crap? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5381.2s)]
*  We're never going to forget those stupid masks. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5382.24s)]
*  Oh, I was so happy we didn't do that with our gym. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5384.6s)]
*  I just taped everything off. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5387.68s)]
*  And then we just let everybody go on the backside. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5389.72s)]
*  And not one had COVID. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5393.76s)]
*  Everybody's rolling in the gym. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5397.0s)]
*  Everybody's doing just be freaking healthy. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5398.4400000000005s)]
*  We were lied to. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5401.04s)]
*  It wasn't it wasn't something that was terrifying and dangerous to fit people. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5402.639999999999s)]
*  It just wasn't. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5407.0s)]
*  It was dangerous to people that already had comorbidities. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5408.32s)]
*  Ninety four percent of the people that died had some massive comorbidity. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5411.04s)]
*  Multiple comorbidities for some of them. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5417.16s)]
*  It's just it was a strange time. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5419.28s)]
*  And obviously, there was a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking going on right now. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5422.44s)]
*  If you go and try to think about what should have been done or shouldn't have been done. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5426.639999999999s)]
*  But most people that were healthy should have been left alone. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5430.5599999999995s)]
*  That's it, especially with the ventilator stuff. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5434.96s)]
*  There's a lot of people died there. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5437.0s)]
*  That was another report that just came out. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5438.24s)]
*  Yeah, the ventilators, the people that died in the ventilators died from the ventilators. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5440.0s)]
*  A giant percentage of that's they shouldn't have been put in the ventilators. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5444.32s)]
*  And this doctor was saying that they put they put people on the ventilators [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5448.28s)]
*  to protect the hospital staff and the doctors and the nurses. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5451.36s)]
*  Because these people had COVID and they figured, well, just put them on a ventilator. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5455.68s)]
*  And they didn't realize they were destroying their lungs. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5458.56s)]
*  But how I still till this day, I can't get it. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5461.200000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot of people need to be in on it. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5463.84s)]
*  That right. Even the doctors. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5465.52s)]
*  I don't think they were in on it. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5467.0s)]
*  I just think that they didn't know what was going on. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5468.84s)]
*  And then there was. Yeah. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5471.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, and then there was also people telling, you know, there was the Fauci [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5472.76s)]
*  and all these people that were telling people that this was this [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5477.04s)]
*  horrible, devastating illness that was going to destroy everyone. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5481.240000000001s)]
*  And no one was safe. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5484.76s)]
*  You have to get vaccinated. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5486.400000000001s)]
*  No one's safe, which is crazy. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5487.72s)]
*  Yeah. Especially if did you get it? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5489.360000000001s)]
*  Did you get no, no, no, no. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5491.2s)]
*  Never got COVID at all. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5492.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, I got COVID, but I did. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5493.320000000001s)]
*  I've been back to it. It was five days. It was good. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5494.4400000000005s)]
*  I had no problem. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5496.2s)]
*  And I've been traveling. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5497.92s)]
*  We went to Budapest. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5499.0s)]
*  We did everything for the the chronic combat shows. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5499.92s)]
*  But that was the I don't know if you ever saw the show with the background, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5502.4400000000005s)]
*  with the people flying. We go back in the future. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5505.72s)]
*  We go we go in the past. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5507.72s)]
*  We go to the roots of Okinawa. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5509.96s)]
*  It's all because of green screens that we had with the unreal engine, you know, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5512.2s)]
*  that they created. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5516.08s)]
*  And now it's live because in the beginning they couldn't do live shows with it. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5517.88s)]
*  So that's recently to like three years ago. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5521.6s)]
*  Now you can do it live like the Mandalorian, you know, Blade Runner. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5524.6s)]
*  They all use that those movies. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5528.44s)]
*  And now that's the technology that Karate Kombat uses. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5530.68s)]
*  And now it can be live. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5533.48s)]
*  So before it was live to to to tape. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5534.6s)]
*  You know, and everybody had to shut up. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5538.6s)]
*  Nobody could say if they want to lost. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5540.04s)]
*  I go, stop batting. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5542.24s)]
*  Well, there was definitely there was some MMA fights [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5544.76s)]
*  where the results were available, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5550.0s)]
*  but the public didn't know about them and people bet on them. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5553.48s)]
*  I had heard about a bunch of those. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5558.48s)]
*  Oh, look at this. Wow. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5560.28s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5563.28s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5565.68s)]
*  Yeah. The green screen. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5566.68s)]
*  They did it, man. Wow. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5568.84s)]
*  We're doing a really good job. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5570.68s)]
*  How many events do you guys have in a year? [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5573.52s)]
*  Eight to 10 this year now. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5575.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The chairman. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5578.160000000001s)]
*  And then we have the vice president, Kovacs, who used to be gold medal [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5581.080000000001s)]
*  winner in the Olympics, 2009, not the Olympics on the World Championships in 2009, I believe. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5584.52s)]
*  And he's gathering everybody together. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5589.72s)]
*  But then you see that fight, you know, the Rafael Agaiaf, you know, for for Raymond [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5591.88s)]
*  Daniels, it would suck, but it put freaking karate on the map. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5595.52s)]
*  Nobody would have expected that. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5598.88s)]
*  And the same what you saw with Joshua Craig [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5600.160000000001s)]
*  and getting knocked out by Ibrahim, that was a guy who was only doing point [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5602.0s)]
*  fighting. And now the guy that you just saw kicking the guy in the face [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5605.24s)]
*  was his very first full contact match. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5608.64s)]
*  The guy never fought for full contact. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5611.28s)]
*  Oh, wow. So you just came straight from point. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5613.64s)]
*  So these guys are doing freaking phenomenal. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5615.92s)]
*  You know, I always said that that was the one thing that was missing from MMA. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5618.12s)]
*  Before Michael Venom Page entered, I was like a really elite point fighter. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5622.0s)]
*  The way they can close distance is so different. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5627.88s)]
*  So bad, bad. It's incredible. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5630.72s)]
*  Their ability to blitz and leap forward. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5633.04s)]
*  Like those guys are so accustomed to doing that against other elite blackbelts [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5635.92s)]
*  like fainting, fainting, fainting, and they dive in for a regular fighter. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5641.04s)]
*  An MMA fighter, maybe a plotting kind of a guy like they're sitting ducks. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5646.2s)]
*  That's it. But you can see Wonderboy. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5650.12s)]
*  Yeah. The other machina. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5652.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5653.92s)]
*  That's a different level, man. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5655.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a white stance. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5656.4800000000005s)]
*  And they're still moving really. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5657.84s)]
*  How about Wonderboy still fucking winning? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5659.8s)]
*  Still winning. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5662.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, what a clinic that was. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5663.24s)]
*  How old is Wonderboy? Is he 40? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5664.68s)]
*  He's got to be 40 with the fact that he beat, you know, Kevin Holland, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5666.88s)]
*  who's a motherfucker. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5670.4800000000005s)]
*  The way like fighting. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5671.72s)]
*  He was standing here and he fights a kick in through the guard. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5673.8s)]
*  I mean, his timing is bizarre. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5676.4400000000005s)]
*  I just did a seminar with him and his father, Ray. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5678.280000000001s)]
*  What is it in Kentucky? Somerville, Kentucky. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5681.68s)]
*  It was that good people, man. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5684.96s)]
*  Is he makes you feel good all the time? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5686.8s)]
*  North Carolina. Is that where he is? South. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5690.24s)]
*  South Carolina. That's where he is now. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5692.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Those guys, man. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5693.6s)]
*  What Wonderboy did first of all, Kevin Holland did the craziest thing in that fight. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5695.68s)]
*  He agreed to not go to the ground. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5699.360000000001s)]
*  Hmm. It's like, let's not go to the ground. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5701.28s)]
*  Let's just stand up and fight like, OK, now he doesn't have to think about takedowns. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5703.16s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, this is not what you want. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5707.2s)]
*  This is not what you want. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5711.92s)]
*  That was not a smart decision. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5713.08s)]
*  That was Kevin Randleman to me in the elevator before the day before the fight. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5715.44s)]
*  It opens up and I'm by myself. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5720.759999999999s)]
*  And there he is. And he gets in and the door closes and we can see each other. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5722.839999999999s)]
*  It's you and him in the room. Oh, no. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5727.36s)]
*  And I go, something. He goes, I'm doing good. I get good. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5729.799999999999s)]
*  He says, listen, if you promise to keep your feet on the ground, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5732.919999999999s)]
*  I won't take you down. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5736.879999999999s)]
*  So if I wouldn't kick him, he would not take me down. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5738.879999999999s)]
*  I go, wow. I go serious. Yeah. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5742.599999999999s)]
*  I go, huh? I say, let me think about that because I'm just laughing and he's laughing. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5744.44s)]
*  So elevator goes open and I say, OK, good luck tomorrow. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5748.5599999999995s)]
*  He goes, yeah, you too. So the first we're in the fight. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5751.719999999999s)]
*  And the first thing he does is slapping his thigh like kick me. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5755.719999999999s)]
*  And I go like, wait, wait, wait, wait. You just said. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5758.679999999999s)]
*  So my plan must not go and kick anyway, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5763.4s)]
*  because against a wrestler like that, if I kick, he's going to grab my kick. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5766.08s)]
*  And that's it. Right. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5768.5599999999995s)]
*  So as soon as he invited, I thought, oh, I got you. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5769.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm going to make I'm going to act like I do a roundhouse kick [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5773.0s)]
*  and I'm going to turn it into a front kick. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5775.76s)]
*  So if he thinks it's a roundhouse kick and he's going to shoot in, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5777.92s)]
*  I'm going to kick him square on the face with the front kick, with my heel fights over. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5780.72s)]
*  But I'm being by the boom. I won. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5783.72s)]
*  That was the game plan. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5785.6s)]
*  Didn't work out like that. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5788.200000000001s)]
*  So as soon as I made the kick, he backed away. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5789.240000000001s)]
*  And I go, wait, he backs away from my kicks. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5792.08s)]
*  Let's start kicking. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5795.56s)]
*  And then the second kick, I threw it to me. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5797.08s)]
*  He said, you know, fight with you. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5799.96s)]
*  You won that fight primarily off your back. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5801.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's what Big John said. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5805.08s)]
*  Just lay on top of a guy and you were smashing with elbows and punches off of your back. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5806.96s)]
*  Yeah. His son just won the Nevada Championship this weekend on Saturday. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5812.4800000000005s)]
*  Basketball. Yeah, I was posting about that. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5818.16s)]
*  The basketball team said that was really cool. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5820.28s)]
*  Kevin Randleman was such a freak. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5822.28s)]
*  So athletic when we knocked out Mirko Cro Cop. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5824.8s)]
*  Dude, crazy. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5828.0s)]
*  And then the second fight right after that, the suplex is Phaidor Emelianenko. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5829.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5833.52s)]
*  This is going to happen. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5835.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5836.200000000001s)]
*  But Phaidor, man, the fact that like seconds later, he catches him in an arm bar. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5838.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Katamani Komura. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5843.120000000001s)]
*  Special guy. Oh, my God. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5844.6s)]
*  Phaidor was, you know, when we look at goats. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5846.280000000001s)]
*  He's got to be in there. He's got to be. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5849.4800000000005s)]
*  He's got to be in there. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5851.160000000001s)]
*  There's no one. I think John Jones. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5852.120000000001s)]
*  If you if you want to say who's the best ever. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5854.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. God, it's hard. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5857.08s)]
*  It's hard to argue with John Jones. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5858.6s)]
*  Yeah. Never lost. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5860.44s)]
*  Beat everybody. Fought everybody. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5861.84s)]
*  Yeah. Smashed everybody. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5864.28s)]
*  And then goes up to the heavyweight and makes it easy. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5866.04s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, obviously, you can't do MMA math. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5868.72s)]
*  But if you look what Francis Ngano had a long fight with Serial Gone [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5871.44s)]
*  and John Jones just took him apart instantaneously. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5875.4s)]
*  Seconds. Yeah. You know, he's an animal. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5878.24s)]
*  He's and he's. Super talented. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5880.56s)]
*  This is a guy that if he stays straight, like on everything, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5884.48s)]
*  also the outside fighting, you know, it's going to be very hard to beat. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5887.599999999999s)]
*  He's got no patterns. Right. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5891.16s)]
*  He doesn't have any pattern. It's constantly switching. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5892.959999999999s)]
*  It's like hard to figure a guy like that out. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5896.0s)]
*  I was training him. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5898.32s)]
*  I was interviewing him before a fight in Albuquerque. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5899.5599999999995s)]
*  And they flew me over for inside MMA. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5903.679999999999s)]
*  And he says, what are you doing afterwards? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5905.759999999999s)]
*  I said, I go to the hotel. I need something. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5907.08s)]
*  He says, man, can you train me for an hour? [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5908.959999999999s)]
*  I go, sure. Yeah, I would love that. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5911.04s)]
*  So we're on the focus, Mitch. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5913.4s)]
*  And I had let him in the four shots and he goes to to to. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5915.2s)]
*  I say, go faster. You're faster than this. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5917.96s)]
*  They go pop up. I said, dude, go fast. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5919.36s)]
*  I said, just think this. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5922.4s)]
*  That that that that that that that just think that in your head. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5923.44s)]
*  And he goes to do to do to do. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5926.839999999999s)]
*  And he stops and looks at me, go like, dude. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5928.5599999999995s)]
*  I go, yeah, because this is how I work with sound effects. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5931.4s)]
*  If you keep them high paced, your body will automatically trigger [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5933.92s)]
*  and you're going to be that's fast. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5936.839999999999s)]
*  I go, dude. So two weeks later, I have Greg Jackson on the show. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5939.0s)]
*  And he's walking in on inside of a man. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5943.24s)]
*  I go, Greg, what's up? [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5945.0s)]
*  And he goes, I'm doing good. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5946.48s)]
*  He said, what you been doing to the gym? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5947.44s)]
*  I go, what do you mean? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5949.36s)]
*  He says, everybody's making these stupid, crazy sound effects. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5950.2s)]
*  I say, are they faster and more explosive? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5953.96s)]
*  He goes, yeah, I go, you're welcome, dude. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5956.32s)]
*  Where did that come from? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5961.5199999999995s)]
*  Is that something you just invented yourself? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5962.5599999999995s)]
*  I always did that. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5964.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, I put combination only reload punches. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5966.04s)]
*  That's there's a beat. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5968.92s)]
*  So if I say two and a crosshook will be two. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5970.04s)]
*  And then a crosshook to papa papa. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5972.92s)]
*  That's the first in my mind. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5975.280000000001s)]
*  It's already when I throw a combination, it's immediately identified [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5977.0s)]
*  with a with a with a pattern. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5981.0s)]
*  So with three shot, one, two, three, and then a liver shot cross. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5983.400000000001s)]
*  That's in my head right away. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5986.320000000001s)]
*  Papa, papa. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5988.400000000001s)]
*  And that's I always been doing that somehow. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5990.12s)]
*  It's really weird. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5992.4800000000005s)]
*  I got this crazy, crazy student. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5993.320000000001s)]
*  He's he's the lead actor of [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5996.4800000000005s)]
*  Night Agent to hear about that new show on Netflix. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=5999.4400000000005s)]
*  It broke the top five of. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6002.16s)]
*  Higher viewers ever from the top five. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6005.639999999999s)]
*  So it's big. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6007.639999999999s)]
*  Gabriel Basso is his name. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6008.96s)]
*  And his great actor was in Hillbilly Elegy. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6011.2s)]
*  He was one of the main guys there. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6014.08s)]
*  He was the story was about him. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6015.5599999999995s)]
*  But anyway, this guy is a is a freak like he trained [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6017.5199999999995s)]
*  two and a half months with us. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6022.92s)]
*  Yes, he had some experience before. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6024.04s)]
*  But when you give him instructions, he immediately does it. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6025.72s)]
*  And like Kevin James, like one of those guys. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6029.88s)]
*  But then this one is like when I came home, my wife said, how is he? [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6031.6s)]
*  I go, he's me, but way better than me. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6034.8s)]
*  And and the way he hits the first time I told him when I saw him, I say, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6037.280000000001s)]
*  if you get in a street fight, do not hit the person in the head. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6040.72s)]
*  You can kill a guy. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6043.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's how hard he hits one eighty five. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6044.52s)]
*  It's he jacks my arms up. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6046.84s)]
*  It's like bizarre, you know, but listening to instructions [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6048.72s)]
*  immediately does everything you say. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6051.88s)]
*  So he's on a movie set for 10 weeks. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6053.56s)]
*  And he calls me, says, hey, I'm going to be home in between [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6056.280000000001s)]
*  before I start shooting the movie, the Netflix show. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6058.4400000000005s)]
*  I have like 10 days. I want to fight. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6061.2s)]
*  I've been training. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6063.4800000000005s)]
*  He said a little bit on the back. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6064.24s)]
*  I go, you sure you want to do this? [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6065.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to know how it feels. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6066.8s)]
*  I go, OK, so let me make some phone calls. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6068.4400000000005s)]
*  So I make a phone call. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6070.16s)]
*  I got in contact with George Francis. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6071.08s)]
*  He's owning a Thai boxing company. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6072.68s)]
*  And we find a guy for him. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6075.76s)]
*  He's seven and one. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6077.0s)]
*  It's a tall, tall guy, seven, six, five. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6078.88s)]
*  And I say, you want to do that? [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6082.360000000001s)]
*  He goes, yeah, sure. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6083.6s)]
*  I go. And they're already asking me, are you sure? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6084.320000000001s)]
*  Because you never thought I said, listen, man, the guy is a freak. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6086.76s)]
*  But I don't know how he's going to perform under pressure. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6089.599999999999s)]
*  But that's always the big question mark. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6091.839999999999s)]
*  But it looks to me since he's an actor and since, you know, he's [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6093.639999999999s)]
*  he's dealing with pressure the whole time. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6097.12s)]
*  I think it's going to be OK. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6099.44s)]
*  But you never know. But I think it will be OK. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6100.719999999999s)]
*  Is it? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6104.0s)]
*  This is the fight. This is the fight. Yeah. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6107.5599999999995s)]
*  So he comes up with this song that that that that that that that that that that [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6109.36s)]
*  that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6115.32s)]
*  the Atlantic Commission lady goes like, that's a stupid song. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6117.88s)]
*  He goes, hey, hey, while he's walking up, hey, that's my song. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6120.08s)]
*  Don't talk bad about my. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6122.4400000000005s)]
*  He's completely like whatever. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6123.52s)]
*  This is very relaxed. Yeah. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6126.04s)]
*  And I tell him, I said, what do I do? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6127.4400000000005s)]
*  I say, go left to the head and across to the body. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6128.72s)]
*  Boom. There's the liver shot starts. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6132.4400000000005s)]
*  This is just this is the very first time that he fought, right? So I. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6136.56s)]
*  I said, I want you to throw a left hook to the head, who's undefeated, seven and [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6141.8s)]
*  no left hook. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6145.64s)]
*  And then he throws a left hook with a cross to the body. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6147.400000000001s)]
*  And he comes from a movie set. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6153.0s)]
*  He didn't train a lick. You got to know that as well. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6155.56s)]
*  Right. I mean, he hasn't been sparring. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6157.72s)]
*  And in the second time of training, second day training, he broke his head. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6160.96s)]
*  Of a hurt his hand. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6165.52s)]
*  Now, I wanted the cross to the body. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6167.200000000001s)]
*  It's coming, boom. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6172.280000000001s)]
*  There we go. It is. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6175.56s)]
*  Right. So so now he gets an eight count and he's looking at me. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6176.52s)]
*  What do I do? I go do the same thing. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6179.76s)]
*  So this is the hook cross to the body. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6181.76s)]
*  And then he just. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6184.68s)]
*  Once that connects. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6186.92s)]
*  Yeah, that guy afterwards went like that, I never been hit like this. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6188.88s)]
*  Boom. Oh, it is funny. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6193.240000000001s)]
*  I have some people just have natural power. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6195.6s)]
*  It's very weird, isn't it? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6197.88s)]
*  Yeah, but also without, like I said, without training, never been in there, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6199.200000000001s)]
*  just want to do this. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6202.68s)]
*  I got good. Are you sure? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6205.400000000001s)]
*  And then his right hand, he hurts on the second day of training, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6207.16s)]
*  which, by the way, he had only seven days. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6209.92s)]
*  There he goes. Yeah, this is it. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6213.8s)]
*  Wow. Just across to the body. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6215.92s)]
*  Power is a strange thing. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6219.12s)]
*  It's like you either have it or you do not have it. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6221.12s)]
*  He just did that. I just saw in post yesterday something. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6223.400000000001s)]
*  They have these bars that you grab at the fingers, you know, those flat things [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6225.84s)]
*  you have to pull up. 86 kilos. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6229.280000000001s)]
*  He lifted. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6231.72s)]
*  Jesus. So just with quick strength. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6232.88s)]
*  It's flat, the bar, right? [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6235.12s)]
*  Is that like 190 pounds? What is it? [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6237.320000000001s)]
*  What is 86 kilos? Yeah, that's around that. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6239.04s)]
*  Jesus Christ. That's crazy. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6242.08s)]
*  Squeezing. He just does it. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6244.280000000001s)]
*  And then he's a drummer and a crazy drummer. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6245.96s)]
*  Then he's an artist. He makes drawings. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6248.400000000001s)]
*  Well, this agency gets a phone call from some art gallery saying [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6250.6s)]
*  that it could be the next big thing. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6254.4400000000005s)]
*  Wow. So he's just a guy who could do anything. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6256.68s)]
*  He can do anything. Wow. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6258.84s)]
*  There's people like that out there. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6261.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And a bunch of them. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6263.04s)]
*  We don't even know. Yeah, I know. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6264.32s)]
*  That's what's that's what's wild. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6266.2s)]
*  It's scary. Yeah. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6267.719999999999s)]
*  Well, that's where a guy like Houston Alexander just slips in the mix [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6268.88s)]
*  and knocks out Keith Jardine like, yeah, fuck this. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6271.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a lot of those guys out there. Yeah. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6273.96s)]
*  There's guys out there. There's freaks out there. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6275.76s)]
*  Yeah. Is that a great thing about life? [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6279.04s)]
*  It is a great thing about life. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6281.04s)]
*  It's an interesting thing about life, though. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6282.679999999999s)]
*  You would never imagine, you know, you'd never imagine that certain people [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6284.48s)]
*  have certain skills or that certain people just they have an ability [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6288.04s)]
*  to learn things. Do you believe you have to write [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6291.84s)]
*  that in is already living among us, right? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6294.64s)]
*  Aliens got to be now we're talking about. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6297.04s)]
*  Yeah. Now you're talking. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6298.92s)]
*  No, because why can't they like freaking Yol Romero? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6300.04s)]
*  You're talking about that, right? [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6305.68s)]
*  Three times bigger. Yeah. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6306.76s)]
*  And things. But I don't think he's an alien. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6308.68s)]
*  I think no, no. But I mean, this is a product of a sports program [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6310.5199999999995s)]
*  that's very elite. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6314.08s)]
*  No, I mean, also, there's genetics. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6315.64s)]
*  There's incredible training. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6318.160000000001s)]
*  There's there's a lot going on. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6320.0s)]
*  But I don't think the aliens are even remotely interested in. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6321.160000000001s)]
*  No, no, but no, no, no, no, no. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6323.68s)]
*  I'm not saying that. But there's got to be if they live among us, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6325.320000000001s)]
*  there's got to be freaks, right? [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6328.04s)]
*  But they cannot expose themselves. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6330.12s)]
*  Because otherwise, they everybody would know. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6332.360000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's John Jones secret. Maybe he's an alien. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6335.84s)]
*  Yeah, got us. Maybe Mighty Mouse is an alien, too. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6337.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6340.76s)]
*  I think I mean, I think if there are aliens amongst us, [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6342.48s)]
*  they're they're watching us to make sure we don't blow ourselves up. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6346.16s)]
*  That's 100 percent. Yeah. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6348.919999999999s)]
*  But that's why they hang out at the nuclear sites a lot. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6351.08s)]
*  Yeah. I've had so many conversations with people that are. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6354.12s)]
*  Yeah, Ryan Graves. I was a nice interview. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6357.04s)]
*  Very interesting. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6359.5199999999995s)]
*  But the cool thing was, you know, because that's when I put it together [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6360.599999999999s)]
*  with Mr. Kakura, you had also. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6362.879999999999s)]
*  But they were talking about when they would arrive, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6364.839999999999s)]
*  the aliens were already waiting for them. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6368.28s)]
*  They knew exactly where they were going to go. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6369.799999999999s)]
*  And I go, that's quantum computers. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6372.44s)]
*  He was talking about that. There's no more secrets. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6374.12s)]
*  Yes. You see, so they're already there way ahead. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6376.2s)]
*  I mean, if they're just a thousand years more advanced than us, just a thousand. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6379.36s)]
*  Yeah. Oh. It's impossible to understand what they're capable of. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6382.5599999999995s)]
*  And now maybe a million years. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6385.96s)]
*  Imagine if there were a million years more advanced. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6387.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. No, that's what I tell people. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6389.36s)]
*  We our age, we saw every I saw our TV change from black and white to color. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6391.16s)]
*  Yeah. From 12 channels, you have to press the button and turn orange. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6396.639999999999s)]
*  Click, click, click, you know, 12 buttons. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6400.4s)]
*  Yeah. That was it. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6402.8s)]
*  Remote control. Oh, my God. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6404.32s)]
*  Yeah. And then we will go out. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6406.599999999999s)]
*  It was pretty much universal. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6407.8s)]
*  We will go to other people on the outside, you know, they're watching TV [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6409.2s)]
*  and we would change the channel and we thought it was hilarious. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6412.36s)]
*  And I started hitting the TV. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6414.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, and then the phones and the cell phones. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6417.2s)]
*  I remember the first time there was an answering machine. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6421.48s)]
*  I was like, this is the craziest thing. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6423.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You can call someone, leave a message. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6425.12s)]
*  Yeah. This is nuts. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6427.28s)]
*  I had a voice dialer. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6429.96s)]
*  You know, there's things you say home and then you hold it against the phone. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6432.12s)]
*  You go to do it. And then it was called. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6434.8s)]
*  Yeah. My buddy's going like, oh, my God. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6436.84s)]
*  I said, they're going to have this in phones. You watch. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6438.6s)]
*  He goes, oh, my God, they're going to be phones without a 100 percent. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6440.32s)]
*  I said, they're going to have this in there. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6444.52s)]
*  I guarantee you that. It has to be. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6446.04s)]
*  You know, yeah, that was crazy. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6447.92s)]
*  Well, we're experiencing now is probably the biggest change [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6450.2s)]
*  in human civilization that the world has ever seen. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6453.68s)]
*  And it's happening right in front of us. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6456.92s)]
*  Just with the Internet and then with social media and smartphones [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6459.2s)]
*  and all these things that have happened since, you know, the early 1990s [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6462.5599999999995s)]
*  to what we're experiencing now. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6466.5199999999995s)]

*  and keep oxygen out of your lungs and inhale monoxide and dioxide [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6877.6s)]
*  and get cancer of the lungs and also weak heart and heart attack [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6883.200000000001s)]
*  and kaput. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6887.48s)]
*  Whoa, weird. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6889.8s)]
*  Dude, his book, it's insanity. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6892.8s)]
*  And then you go, there's no way this is possible. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6894.76s)]
*  And they go to a dentist and he checks out his teeth. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6897.2s)]
*  And while he's doing it, he bites the metal thing that he's in his mouth, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6900.16s)]
*  bites it in half. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6903.599999999999s)]
*  The guy writes about that. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6905.28s)]
*  What are you going to do against a guy like that? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6908.36s)]
*  135 pounds. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6910.719999999999s)]
*  Well, there's people that are just built different. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6912.04s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you've got to think these guys are big noses, little noses, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6913.92s)]
*  guys with little dicks, giant dicks, people that are built different. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6917.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6920.12s)]
*  There's a big spectrum. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6921.04s)]
*  People are built. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6922.88s)]
*  Yeah. That's like how you go from noses to dicks. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6924.08s)]
*  That's what it is. Right. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6927.32s)]
*  It's like big brains, small brains. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6928.5199999999995s)]
*  Some people's brains work great. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6930.5199999999995s)]
*  Some people's brains are just like the dog shit. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6931.8s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's a it's a weird thing. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6934.64s)]
*  You know, going back to power, like why people have power, [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6938.0s)]
*  like you can't predict. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6941.76s)]
*  You get a guy who's like first day of classes [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6944.12s)]
*  and you have him hit a heavy bag and you just go, Jesus Christ, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6947.4s)]
*  what the fuck is he doing? [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6951.32s)]
*  Why is he how can he do it? [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6952.8s)]
*  And then you have someone who looks athletic and you have them do it [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6954.08s)]
*  and they just can't generate any power. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6957.2s)]
*  Yeah. Very strange. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6959.24s)]
*  You saw that guy who goes dressed up as the maintenance guy to these big gyms. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6960.48s)]
*  And he's like a world champion powerlifting, but he dresses up [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6965.88s)]
*  like he's the guy who just works there. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6968.8s)]
*  No. And he starts telling, oh, this is hilarious. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6970.84s)]
*  These bodybuilders, these giant guys, you do it wrong. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6973.2s)]
*  You should do it like this. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6976.68s)]
*  They go, dude, you work here, man. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6977.72s)]
*  Look at me. Look at this muscle. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6979.04s)]
*  And then the little guy just start bench pressing with their weight. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6980.4s)]
*  What's this guy? That little guy? [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6983.84s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, so he's wearing that outfit to kind of hide his physique. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6985.64s)]
*  Heavy life, you know. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6990.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=6994.0s)]

*  Look at that guy. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7042.2s)]
*  Look, this bar is bending. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7045.24s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7047.24s)]
*  Anatoly on YouTube, he's got a 16 million views. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7049.64s)]

*  Yeah. There's guys out there. Yeah. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7065.44s)]
*  And you got to watch out. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7067.6s)]
*  Yeah. You haven't been fighting as well. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7068.68s)]
*  And then you make a statement against the wrong guy. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7071.24s)]
*  All right. Chris Hordesky. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7073.6s)]
*  Imagine that guy in the street. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7075.12s)]
*  Hey, baby face. You want to go? [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7076.6s)]
*  Right. He was Hordesky was. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7079.76s)]
*  There's a perfect example. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7082.08s)]
*  It was such a like a cute guy. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7084.12s)]
*  He went to the International Fight League. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7086.719999999999s)]
*  Remember that organization? [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7088.48s)]
*  I was one of the coaches there. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7090.04s)]
*  Sean Tompkins. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7091.92s)]
*  He he said, watch him. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7093.5199999999995s)]
*  And he fought a guy from Hansel Grace's team. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7096.44s)]
*  And he goes, dude, he's a kid. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7098.92s)]
*  He says, just watch. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7100.04s)]
*  He was like 18 at the time, right? [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7101.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And he just annihilates the guy. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7102.759999999999s)]
*  Became my instant favorite because the baby face, you know, [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7105.84s)]
*  it's like. But just a freaking killer. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7109.2s)]
*  When you see a guy like that, you wonder, like, [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7112.32s)]
*  one like he was so young when he fought in the UFC. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7115.96s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if like maybe if he got in the amateurs longer, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7119.639999999999s)]
*  maybe if, you know, they set like one of the problems with joining [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7126.48s)]
*  something like the UFC is that you are in with the elite of the elite. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7132.08s)]
*  And if you keep winning, you can only win so many times before [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7135.84s)]
*  you're going to fight someone who's a motherfucker. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7139.36s)]
*  And if you're 20 years old, unless you're John Jones, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7141.24s)]
*  who fights Shogun for his, you know, 22 years old, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7144.599999999999s)]
*  he wins the world title, becomes the youngest ever UFC champion. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7148.84s)]
*  That's but that's so rare. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7152.08s)]
*  That's one so many guys get ruined. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7153.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, because they weren't really quite ready for that level. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7156.2s)]
*  And unlike boxing, where they'll like get you ready for that [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7159.5599999999995s)]
*  by exposing you to different styles, exposing you to, you know, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7164.2s)]
*  this guy's long and lanky. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7168.28s)]
*  This guy's a body puncher. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7170.12s)]
*  It's egos and it's managers. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7172.52s)]
*  Are you listening to your manager? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7174.76s)]
*  And they see a good manager for you. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7176.4800000000005s)]
*  He will do it the right way. Right. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7178.360000000001s)]
*  But otherwise, if they look at the big money, [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7180.360000000001s)]
*  they call these guys in Japan that they call it like a fight [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7182.64s)]
*  like a robbery for a hundred thousand dollars. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7184.68s)]
*  They go, if you lose horribly, you'll never be back. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7186.400000000001s)]
*  Just know that. Yes. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7188.88s)]
*  Yes. If you get a guy to like, imagine if you were training today, [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7190.72s)]
*  training people today and you got a young guy, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7195.120000000001s)]
*  would you want him to fight? [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7198.320000000001s)]
*  Here's the other problem. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7199.88s)]
*  If you want him to fight in other organizations, boy, [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7201.12s)]
*  there's some murderers in these other organizations [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7203.68s)]
*  that people don't even know about. Yeah. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7205.64s)]
*  These assassins like I'm sure the PFL has them. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7207.08s)]
*  I know Bellator has them. I know one FC has them. Yep. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7210.0s)]
*  I mean, there's some stone cold killers over there. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7213.16s)]
*  Just finding a lot. That's what I say. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7215.8s)]
*  And if you for the pressure in the beginning, you know, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7217.32s)]
*  don't tell anybody you're going to fight, do it out of state. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7219.24s)]
*  So then if you lose, you don't even have to tell people. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7221.5199999999995s)]
*  If you win, you can say, I just fought and I won. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7224.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that's the best way [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7227.48s)]
*  because I think it's very hard for a fighter right now [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7229.52s)]
*  with all the pressure on the social media. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7231.68s)]
*  You know, they don't want to they don't fight for themselves. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7233.4400000000005s)]
*  They fight for the people. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7235.76s)]
*  And I think that's a big problem. Yeah. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7237.120000000001s)]
*  I have you know, you don't need to [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7239.040000000001s)]
*  don't give a crap about anybody. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7242.320000000001s)]
*  If you just care about yourself only in fighting, of course, [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7244.360000000001s)]
*  you don't want to be a douche. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7247.52s)]
*  But if you really master that, and I think that I at that time, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7248.96s)]
*  that was it. People say, why? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7252.76s)]
*  Why do you think it works? I said, because I fight for me. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7254.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but for your family. I go now. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7256.68s)]
*  Not for your family. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7258.68s)]
*  I said, no, because there's too much pressure on me. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7259.4400000000005s)]
*  If I fight for me and I just only about me, I don't give a crap. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7261.6s)]
*  And that means I will fight at my best. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7265.320000000001s)]
*  And once I fight at my best chance, I'm going to win. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7266.92s)]
*  It's far very high. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7268.64s)]
*  And then my family automatically is going to be taken care of. Right. Right. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7269.64s)]
*  So once you start putting, oh, I got to win this because otherwise [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7272.92s)]
*  I can't do this or can't do that. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7275.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a bad one. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7277.6s)]
*  Well, it's not a good thing to focus on. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7278.6s)]
*  The best thing to focus on is your performance. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7280.280000000001s)]
*  Focus on fighting. Focus on technique. Focus on. Yeah. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7282.68s)]
*  The flow. It's everything. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7286.04s)]
*  Where did you develop this mindset? [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7287.72s)]
*  Did you figure it out on your own? [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7290.280000000001s)]
*  Did you learn any of it from other people? [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7291.64s)]
*  Well, I absolutely didn't have it in Thai boxing. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7293.96s)]
*  Like they always say, oh, he's the great kickboxer from Holland. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7297.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know a lot of people out, but it wasn't pretty. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7299.6s)]
*  I was just very blessed with genetics. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7302.4400000000005s)]
*  And I just but I was I was the dojo fighter. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7304.280000000001s)]
*  So I was really good in the dojo, but I couldn't put that same game [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7306.92s)]
*  under pressure yet. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7310.8s)]
*  And that changed the first fight in Japan because. Really? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7312.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because I think it was my I was a hothead. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7316.799999999999s)]
*  Like, oh, I what is it? [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7320.599999999999s)]
*  Nine knockouts, eight in the first round, one in the second. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7322.36s)]
*  That was all knockouts and it doesn't Thai boxing. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7324.719999999999s)]
*  And I realized if I go to Japan on the day of the fight, I found out [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7327.96s)]
*  there was freaking he was 32 pounds heavier than I was. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7331.5599999999995s)]
*  I didn't know. There was no weight classes. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7334.88s)]
*  And then I found out there was only one round, but it was 30 minutes. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7336.599999999999s)]
*  I go, shoot. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7340.639999999999s)]
*  So I figured that if I explode in the first three minutes, [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7342.2s)]
*  and I can't put him away, well, I got 27 more minutes to go. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7346.24s)]
*  So maybe I got to calm down. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7349.4s)]
*  That's when the are started coming on my hand from relax. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7350.5599999999995s)]
*  Coincidentally, rustic. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7353.5199999999995s)]
*  That's the Dutch word for it. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7355.04s)]
*  And that's and I remember my very first. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7357.36s)]
*  But tell people what we're talking about, because you talked about [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7359.5599999999995s)]
*  in the other podcast, we used to write an R. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7361.4s)]
*  Yeah. On your hand for rustic. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7363.599999999999s)]
*  But it's coincidentally such the words are saying relax. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7365.92s)]
*  And I just because at my corner, because I never had a coach, I trained myself. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7370.4s)]
*  So if if I would get hit, the only thing they shout, stay calm, stay calm, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7374.2s)]
*  because I'm hot at I want to break right away. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7377.5199999999995s)]
*  And I remember the very first time it was. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7380.88s)]
*  It was the wildest. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7385.36s)]
*  It's almost like I had two voices. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7387.32s)]
*  One is the voice who wants to finish it, finish it, go to go in for the kill. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7390.5199999999995s)]
*  And the other one says, oh, take your time, take your time. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7394.12s)]
*  And there was this thing that happened. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7396.32s)]
*  First of all, I started fighting and I heard everybody speaking to [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7397.84s)]
*  the American people who were sitting there. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7400.92s)]
*  I knew what they were talking about, which was weird already. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7402.4s)]
*  Just before the fight, this like literally standing up for my opponent. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7405.679999999999s)]
*  Why would I hear all these people? [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7408.759999999999s)]
*  And then we started fighting. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7410.8s)]
*  And the first thing that happens, I kick him in the head. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7412.08s)]
*  And as soon as I plant my foot, I blast forward and he was six, three. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7414.5199999999995s)]
*  So I hit him with a palm strike, knocked him out. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7417.96s)]
*  He's on the ground. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7420.96s)]
*  Now the crazy stuff happened. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7422.04s)]
*  So I want to run because it was an eight count. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7424.0s)]
*  I want to run to my corner because once I'm in the corner, that means [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7426.4s)]
*  I give him less rest, right? [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7429.5599999999995s)]
*  That's when they start counting. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7430.92s)]
*  But something in me told me not to do that. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7432.72s)]
*  And this is really wild because it was almost like I wasn't in control of that. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7436.0s)]
*  So I wanted to go to the corner. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7440.72s)]
*  And then this person said to me, because I saw his eyes were open. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7442.4800000000005s)]
*  He says, no, it was way more important to to step there, give him a beat, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7445.96s)]
*  look at him and then turn around, walk very slowly to your corner. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7450.6s)]
*  Because somehow this is what the guys this is what I got. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7455.12s)]
*  That will be way more intimidating for him than for me running to the corner. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7459.320000000001s)]
*  And it blew while I'm walking back, I'm thinking, go faster, go faster. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7464.56s)]
*  And it's no, just go come. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7467.96s)]
*  And then you see me hanging like this. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7469.56s)]
*  You're your own coach. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7471.08s)]
*  It was the wildest. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7472.400000000001s)]
*  It was flicking all over the place. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7473.68s)]
*  And then that one person, my whoever was set today, stay calm, stay calm. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7475.320000000001s)]
*  We're just like, you see me hanging like nothing. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7479.64s)]
*  It's all an act. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7482.320000000001s)]
*  If you pull the fight up, it's like I want to run to the corner. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7483.2s)]
*  And then I just look at him, give him a beat. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7486.28s)]
*  And I walk very slow. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7488.679999999999s)]
*  But like I'm saying, there was this inner thing going on. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7490.36s)]
*  It was just bizarre. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7492.759999999999s)]
*  And that was it. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7494.28s)]
*  And then from that moment on, every fight, I was like, wow, [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7495.2s)]
*  I even felt better than in training because everything would slow down. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7498.2s)]
*  It was an experience. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7502.2s)]
*  It was interesting how sometimes a very high pressure moment [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7503.92s)]
*  will open up like a new level of your ability. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7507.28s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7510.599999999999s)]
*  The bubble, that's what I call it. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7513.16s)]
*  I'm in the bubble and it's like I only allow the things that want to come in. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7514.92s)]
*  I allow. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7518.92s)]
*  And for the rest that I don't need, I'm not. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7519.92s)]
*  It's the most peaceful feeling. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7522.08s)]
*  And now I know why. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7524.56s)]
*  I read the Stolen Focus book for John Harry. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7525.400000000001s)]
*  You know, that's a really good book. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7528.6s)]
*  And he says, you know, it's because in fighting, my mind would be calm [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7530.36s)]
*  because my ADD, I'm all over the place. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7535.0s)]
*  I have six conversations going on while I'm talking to you. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7537.84s)]
*  I mean, it goes really it's very hard to control. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7540.16s)]
*  But in fighting or in training, really hard sparring, it's completely [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7543.240000000001s)]
*  that's gone. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7547.68s)]
*  I got one focus because if I don't focus, I'm going to get knocked out. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7548.320000000001s)]
*  So fighting to me was always a very comfort thing to do. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7551.92s)]
*  It was so relaxed because peace finally in my head. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7556.12s)]
*  And yeah, that's it. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7560.280000000001s)]
*  And then I use the ADD just for my workouts to go crazy and crazier. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7561.84s)]
*  But then again, you know, it's great to have. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7565.88s)]
*  But once you stop fighting, that's the trap. Right. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7568.360000000001s)]
*  Now we're going to replace that good feeling. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7571.48s)]
*  And it's probably alcohol or drugs. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7573.28s)]
*  And that's when everybody goes down, including me. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7574.5599999999995s)]
*  For so many fighters, it's very difficult to find your identity after your fight, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7578.4s)]
*  because for fighting, fighting is your whole thing. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7582.4s)]
*  That's the only thing. Everything. Yeah. Everything. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7585.759999999999s)]
*  And the only thing also, that's the problem. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7587.599999999999s)]
*  You don't branch out or you have other fighters who start already branching out [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7589.839999999999s)]
*  before they're a champion. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7593.919999999999s)]
*  Oh, I say, don't do that. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7595.2s)]
*  Focus on that first, because everything else will. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7597.0s)]
*  Once you start losing, they will be gone. Yes. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7599.8s)]
*  You know, you need first. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7602.4800000000005s)]
*  What made you really good? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7603.8s)]
*  Focus on that. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7605.2s)]
*  And once that career is over, go to the next career. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7606.56s)]
*  I'm not saying like when I came to America, I started acting [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7608.76s)]
*  within three months. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7611.8s)]
*  I started taking acting classes because I know eventually [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7612.84s)]
*  I was going to need that. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7616.16s)]
*  You see, so I thought maybe it's better to be prepared for that. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7618.04s)]
*  But just didn't say to anybody. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7621.72s)]
*  Yeah. The transition is very hard [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7624.08s)]
*  for almost everybody. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7628.400000000001s)]
*  It could because fighting requires so much of you. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7630.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, when especially you're fighting in the UFC, you're training [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7633.68s)]
*  probably at least twice a day. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7636.56s)]
*  You're involved in recovery. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7638.24s)]
*  You're monitoring your food. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7640.04s)]
*  You you're you're doing all sorts of different things to try to like [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7641.52s)]
*  keep your body healthy, massage and saunas and all that jazz. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7644.92s)]
*  And then it's over. Yeah. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7649.4800000000005s)]
*  And then you're 35, 36 years old. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7651.76s)]
*  And you realize like, I can't do this anymore. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7654.4400000000005s)]
*  What am I going to do? Yeah. What do I do? [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7656.56s)]
*  And one means one of the things I admire the most about Khabib. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7658.72s)]
*  He just said, that's it. I'm done. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7662.72s)]
*  I'm at the top of the game. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7664.120000000001s)]
*  My mother doesn't want me to fight anymore. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7665.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Good for amazing. Yeah. Undefeated. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7666.92s)]
*  You know, just as I'm done. Yeah. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7670.320000000001s)]
*  And he could be the only one in 50 years from now who did that smart. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7672.76s)]
*  There's very few guys, I mean, that have ever done that. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7677.6s)]
*  I mean, in boxing, it's Andre Ward, you know, retires at the peak. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7680.52s)]
*  And, you know, when Canelo Alvarez knocked out Kovalev, [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7684.56s)]
*  they offered him Canelo Alvarez, and it was for quite a bit of money. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7688.6s)]
*  And Andre Ward, who is a brilliant man, said, [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7692.280000000001s)]
*  I think I serve boxing better by retiring. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7694.92s)]
*  Good for him by staying retired, being a commentator. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7698.96s)]
*  Smart man. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7702.04s)]
*  You know, he's a guy that fought most of his career with one arm. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7702.88s)]
*  Do you know the story about Andre Ward? [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7706.280000000001s)]
*  Andre Ward tore his shoulder apart when he was very young. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7707.96s)]
*  And they just they didn't do surgery on it. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7712.04s)]
*  And so because they didn't do surgery on it, it never got better. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7714.68s)]
*  And so he didn't get surgery until he was a world champion. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7717.6s)]
*  And his shoulder was fucked up like he really beat everybody. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7720.6s)]
*  Karl Frosch, he beat all those guys with one arm. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7723.8s)]
*  Just fucking left hooks and jabs and occasionally throw a right hand. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7726.96s)]
*  But his shoulder was so fucked up. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7730.4800000000005s)]
*  I think one of his major, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7732.320000000001s)]
*  one of the major tendons was detached. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7735.360000000001s)]
*  So like the shoulder was like barely there, sort of like T.J. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7738.280000000001s)]
*  Dillshaw in his last fight. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7743.2s)]
*  T.J. Dillshaw has had fucked up shoulders forever. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7745.24s)]
*  For a long time. Forever. Yeah. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7747.8s)]
*  Yeah. But you think so his opponents didn't know at all [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7750.04s)]
*  that was the best kept secret. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7752.679999999999s)]
*  I don't think people knew. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7753.84s)]
*  You see, that's that's because that's very it's important [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7755.0s)]
*  because if people would know, you see how they changed the game [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7757.599999999999s)]
*  the whole immediately. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7760.12s)]
*  Yeah. But it's wild how that goes, you see, just by knowing that. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7761.44s)]
*  But then again, you have other people like if we can run the rousey that, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7764.08s)]
*  oh, what are you going to do? Arm bar me. Yeah. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7768.08s)]
*  OK. Good luck stopping it. Right. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7770.08s)]
*  Doing it again. Yeah. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7772.16s)]
*  They're so good at one thing that you can you know, it's going to happen, [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7773.68s)]
*  but you can't stop it like Petsch and Glory throws that left kick. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7777.88s)]
*  There you go. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7781.76s)]
*  Yeah. There's there's guys that are like that. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7783.32s)]
*  They just have this one thing. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7785.28s)]
*  Paul Sass used to fight in the UFC and he triangle everybody. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7786.5599999999995s)]
*  It was always triangles. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7789.64s)]
*  He's always won by maybe won a couple of times by leg lock, I think. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7790.72s)]
*  Yeah. But his whole thing was triangles. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7793.92s)]
*  Everybody had to stay away from his triangle. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7796.0s)]
*  And it's like, how is this guy going to beat everybody with a triangle? [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7797.8s)]
*  He figured it out. But yes. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7801.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7803.76s)]
*  Unfortunately for that guy, though, he didn't want to let go. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7806.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's a crazy guy. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7808.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I guess Jake Shields. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7810.12s)]
*  He started hitting him. Yeah. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7812.52s)]
*  Yeah, because he's got a lot of power as well. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7814.2s)]
*  Oh, he's a tank. Yeah. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7816.04s)]
*  I mean, he was like five seven one hundred and eighty five pounds. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7817.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like fucking. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7819.68s)]
*  It's crazy when you talk to me. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7821.12s)]
*  So very soft spoken. Yeah. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7823.04s)]
*  Very quiet. I think I always felt like that was when I would interview him. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7825.12s)]
*  I always felt like that was almost fake. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7829.56s)]
*  Yeah. Like the calmness was like, yeah. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7831.6s)]
*  Fucking hurricane going on. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7834.72s)]
*  That guy's my oh, yeah. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7836.200000000001s)]
*  We had a horrible existence, a horrible childhood. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7837.68s)]
*  His childhood was very, very, very hard. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7840.52s)]
*  Yeah. Lives on the streets of jungle. Right. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7842.92s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he lived in very, very poor existence. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7845.08s)]
*  And like, that's why he has that horrible scar across his chest. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7848.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, he got cut open and never really got medical attention. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7851.52s)]
*  Cut open how? Like, I don't know what happened. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7855.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7857.4800000000005s)]
*  But a movie about that guy. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7858.92s)]
*  But he had that huge scar across his chest. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7860.52s)]
*  But Pahara's was uniquely terrifying [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7862.4400000000005s)]
*  because he knew that not only was he going to leg lock you, [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7865.4400000000005s)]
*  but he wasn't going to let it go. Yeah. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7868.4400000000005s)]
*  And he was going to be I mean, he fucking even did it to Jake Shields. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7870.280000000001s)]
*  He got Jake Shields in a in a camora. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7873.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was there and didn't let it go. Yeah. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7875.240000000001s)]
*  I started hitting him afterwards. Yeah. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7878.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's scary because guys like that can really that's your career. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7880.84s)]
*  They can ruin your ruin your career. Your knee. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7884.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's it. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7886.84s)]
*  That was the guy with I did the heel look [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7887.72s)]
*  because I saw the heel look a day before on a big screen. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7889.64s)]
*  Really? This is how I got my fifth degree black belt. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7893.04s)]
*  That was an honorary black belt. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7895.72s)]
*  I'm with John Blooming, who is the highest guy [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7897.52s)]
*  next to Masayama in Kyokushin. He's got the 11th degree. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7900.12s)]
*  And we're standing, we see this big giant. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7904.16s)]
*  This is a preview for the fights for the next day in Japan. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7905.96s)]
*  Giant screen on the side of a wall. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7909.64s)]
*  And I'm and we got hybrid wrestling, pancrasp. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7912.12s)]
*  We're here. And the first thing we see is me knocking out my first opponent. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7915.8s)]
*  Oh, it's the preview. So we're looking. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7919.320000000001s)]
*  And I see this guy sitting in half guard, grabs his, [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7921.56s)]
*  gets the foot and he falls back. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7924.2s)]
*  And I say to John Blooming, I go, hey, it's a cool move. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7925.64s)]
*  I got to remember that. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7928.4800000000005s)]
*  Next day, I'm fighting. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7932.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm in that position. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7934.56s)]
*  So I go, might as well try. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7936.12s)]
*  So I grabbed it, but I never did it before. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7938.72s)]
*  So I had no clue. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7940.8s)]
*  So I grabbed the heel hook, an inverted heel hook. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7942.0s)]
*  Think about that. And I just fell backwards. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7944.56s)]
*  Yeah. Broke his shin freaking in half. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7947.52s)]
*  So first we heard the clack, clack. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7950.080000000001s)]
*  So I let go. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7952.160000000001s)]
*  I think his knees blown out, right, because that will be it. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7953.64s)]
*  And a referee is asking and he's feeling his knee and he goes, no, I'm good. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7955.84s)]
*  Well, what happened was that his shin must have snapped because that's what we heard. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7959.360000000001s)]
*  And then he kicks me with that leg. Oh, God. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7963.6s)]
*  Yeah. And I just put my weight in it. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7965.96s)]
*  And then you see it bending. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7967.64s)]
*  Has anybody ever come back from that shin snapping? [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7969.0s)]
*  I mean, Tyrone Spong would never really kick box again after that. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7973.2s)]
*  Anderson was never the same after that. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7978.32s)]
*  Chris Weidman still hasn't fought in MMA after that. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7981.32s)]
*  There's reasons that you turn over a kick. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7985.72s)]
*  I always say this to people. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7989.0s)]
*  I'm trying to figure something out here. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7990.44s)]
*  Like, OK, so imagine this is the shin bone. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7992.12s)]
*  I tell this to people, right? It's straight. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7994.2s)]
*  It's it's very hard to break like this. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7996.84s)]
*  Very easy to break like that. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=7999.6s)]
*  Right. Much easier. This is thin. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8002.12s)]
*  This is really thick. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8003.92s)]
*  That's your shin, if you think about it, because it's like this on your shin. Right. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8004.92s)]
*  So if you hit it with the flat part, you know, like a Tyrone Spong, [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8008.64s)]
*  he's kicking really fast. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8012.08s)]
*  Jose Aldo kicks really fast. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8013.08s)]
*  But I always said it before. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8014.64s)]
*  You got to watch out, because if you have somebody checking that kick, [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8017.0s)]
*  he's hitting with the flat part of the shin. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8020.48s)]
*  Sure, it's fast, but very dangerous when you connect with something solid. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8022.32s)]
*  And that's how he broke a shin bone. Right. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8026.48s)]
*  You got to hit it on the edge. That's it. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8028.24s)]
*  That's why the Thais are doing that. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8030.04s)]
*  Because it's their livelihood. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8032.16s)]
*  And if they don't do it, they're freaking going to break the shin. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8033.8s)]
*  And that's it. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8036.32s)]
*  It's interesting because you don't think about that when you think of your shin. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8037.12s)]
*  But if you think of your shin, the part that you really kind of have [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8040.4s)]
*  to turn it over, because the part if you if you have it, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8044.8s)]
*  if your your leg is pointed straight, your shin, the flat part is on the inside. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8048.36s)]
*  That's it. And if you throw it without turning it over, that part will snap. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8053.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8057.96s)]
*  And if you have a stance like I have, like I'm the open stance, [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8059.2s)]
*  my toes are pointing 45 degrees. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8062.72s)]
*  This might this might check. Yeah. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8064.92s)]
*  And I'm not even moving back. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8066.599999999999s)]
*  I'm just doing this. Keep my body weight in there. Right. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8067.96s)]
*  It's going to feel to you like you hit the freaking wall. Yes. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8070.36s)]
*  Super solid block. And then if you kick wrong, that's it. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8073.44s)]
*  You lose the Uriah Hall. Chris Weidman won. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8076.76s)]
*  Scary. Oh, because Chris Weidman just throws full power. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8080.5199999999995s)]
*  First kick. Yeah. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8084.84s)]
*  Uriah Hall, who's an excellent striker, just turns it over, turns it out. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8086.6s)]
*  And then crack. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8090.400000000001s)]
*  We have an open stance karate combats were in Greece. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8091.8s)]
*  I'm commentating main event. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8095.120000000001s)]
*  Seven fights, 55 minutes was the show. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8098.56s)]
*  Everybody got slaughtered. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8101.72s)]
*  The standing open stance. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8103.4400000000005s)]
*  And the first guy, the guy from France, David Doerner, [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8105.56s)]
*  gives him a full inside low kick. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8107.72s)]
*  And I'm saying he should not do that in an open stand. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8109.4400000000005s)]
*  Because in karate combat, you cannot hit the thighs. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8113.4400000000005s)]
*  It's below the knee. Oh, right. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8116.56s)]
*  So shin on shin. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8119.240000000001s)]
*  And I go, he shouldn't do that because this is how you break your shin. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8120.400000000001s)]
*  I say it two seconds later, he kicks again, snaps him in half. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8123.88s)]
*  So you've had one in karate combat, too. For sure. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8128.280000000001s)]
*  Karate combat, you can't get the thigh. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8130.68s)]
*  Not the thighs, you know, and I know because this is the karate rules [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8132.6s)]
*  that they have over there. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8136.160000000001s)]
*  And it keeps the fight a little bit more separated. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8137.360000000001s)]
*  But this is the great thing, you know, because they were actually telling me [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8139.400000000001s)]
*  because you talked about this before in the show about karate combat, [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8142.4800000000005s)]
*  not having the thighs. I really love the thighs as well. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8145.92s)]
*  Also, I love knees to the face. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8148.88s)]
*  Well, they are allowing it now. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8150.92s)]
*  You just cannot grab, you know, but you can throw it loose [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8152.04s)]
*  to the body and to the face. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8154.76s)]
*  That's really nice. Flying knees. Flying knees. Yeah. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8156.04s)]
*  But the great thing about karate combat is we're not the owners. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8160.24s)]
*  The fans are the owners. You know what? [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8165.4800000000005s)]
*  We have a token, the karate token, cryptocurrency, and you can come. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8168.32s)]
*  This is another thing. It's up gaming, we call it. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8172.52s)]
*  You cannot lose weight. You cannot lose. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8175.4s)]
*  You put your tokens on a fighter. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8178.88s)]
*  If that particular fighter wins, 90 percent of those [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8181.719999999999s)]
*  tokens go to you, 10 percent actually goes to the fighter as well. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8184.16s)]
*  So they try to get a lot of it's really cool. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8186.719999999999s)]
*  I like that a lot. Oh, I love it. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8189.92s)]
*  You know, and if you lose, you don't lose your tokens. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8192.32s)]
*  You go, whoa, what's the catch? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8195.84s)]
*  OK, karate combat, they decide we decided that we, you know, [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8197.52s)]
*  for the first three years, we'll we'll we'll take that hit. Really? [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8200.56s)]
*  Yeah. So they want people to go engage. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8204.64s)]
*  And we don't say anything like [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8207.64s)]
*  Rafael Aguayo is the interim champion right now. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8212.0s)]
*  And he is the interim champion because fighters, the fans wanted to fight [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8214.56s)]
*  against Raymond Daniel first before he fought Joshua Cuehagen. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8218.279999999999s)]
*  We listen to the fans and we do what they want to do. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8221.76s)]
*  And that's it. So you you with you saying, I want to have ties included. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8225.4s)]
*  You can petition on the app and you can say, listen, [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8231.08s)]
*  I would like to have that. And if more people support you, they will allow. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8233.96s)]
*  There's going to be a new rule that kicks to the ties. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8237.16s)]
*  Get on it, people. How cool is that? That's great. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8239.56s)]
*  So they listen to the fans. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8242.519999999999s)]
*  They get 10 percent of the fighters. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8243.96s)]
*  And if a lot of people are betting, that could be really good [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8245.359999999999s)]
*  for the fighters as well to get a little bit of extra dough. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8247.96s)]
*  I really like the idea of a token that's attached to an organization. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8250.199999999999s)]
*  That makes me excited about crypto tokens, because look at this. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8253.92s)]
*  OK, all new karate combat app is now live. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8256.84s)]
*  So this is how it works. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8259.92s)]
*  Grow your car. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8262.0s)]
*  So it's a dollar sign and then karate token stash every time your fighter wins. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8263.599999999999s)]
*  Climb the. So that's a great idea. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8269.279999999999s)]
*  It's a great idea also that it goes to the fighters as well. Ten percent. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8271.679999999998s)]
*  If the UFC implemented something like that, I think that would be very successful. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8275.359999999999s)]
*  I think it's a very, very good idea. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8278.599999999999s)]
*  I think so, too. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8280.199999999999s)]
*  Probably one of the most unique ideas that I've heard in a long time [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8280.88s)]
*  and an implementation of crypto token that I think is fantastic. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8283.72s)]
*  It's the Wall Street guys who started this organization. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8287.4s)]
*  And then, you know, in the beginning, they are just study groups [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8290.6s)]
*  to find out who is the most. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8293.720000000001s)]
*  And they realized that the Conor McGregor, like two out of ten people [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8295.36s)]
*  would know him instead of ten out of ten. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8299.48s)]
*  Then they realized Dragon Ball Z ten out of ten would know that in that age group. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8301.6s)]
*  And they go like, wait a minute, if we start combining the two, [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8306.4s)]
*  this is how they literally did that stuff. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8309.84s)]
*  And then they say, hey, what if we do cryptocurrency [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8312.56s)]
*  and we can engage him on the app? [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8315.0s)]
*  And boom, we got Dave in there. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8317.28s)]
*  Dave is super. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8318.72s)]
*  I don't even want to say that. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8321.48s)]
*  I'm not going to say it, but I want to say, but this guy is no, no, [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8322.64s)]
*  he's like the top dogs in cryptocurrency. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8325.279999999999s)]
*  And he came up with this idea for the karate. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8328.08s)]
*  That's a great idea. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8330.48s)]
*  So that's a great idea. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8331.519999999999s)]
*  I really like that idea because of a fighter, if a lot of people are gambling on them [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8333.039999999999s)]
*  and they're winning money, you know, like like when Israel [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8337.24s)]
*  out of Sonia fought Alex Beheira, I think Drake bet like a million dollars [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8340.16s)]
*  on something crazy and won. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8344.599999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't it be nice? [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8346.640000000001s)]
*  Oh, what would you also take a second time? [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8347.640000000001s)]
*  I think he was still favorite. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8350.880000000001s)]
*  Israel was favorite. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8352.36s)]
*  But meanwhile, Beheira was putting it on him. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8353.28s)]
*  He had the calf kicks. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8355.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8356.44s)]
*  His ability to throw those calf kicks with no telegraph. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8357.12s)]
*  He like lifts up the leg, boom. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8361.0s)]
*  And he's not turning the hip over. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8363.04s)]
*  But that's why. Yeah. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8364.6s)]
*  He's got to watch out with that. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8365.92s)]
*  With the same block again. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8367.92s)]
*  Another thing that I really love from him that he does, [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8369.44s)]
*  he doesn't turn his penches over. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8371.68s)]
*  I don't do that either. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8373.16s)]
*  I don't believe in this whole crap. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8374.24s)]
*  You know, if it comes naturally, let it go. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8375.8s)]
*  You know, but if you start focusing on it, a lot of people already do it here. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8377.679999999998s)]
*  You see, you start telegraphing. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8380.279999999999s)]
*  And once you start doing this, this is almost the same as an overhand. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8381.84s)]
*  If I let you get used to this and now an overhead is a complete different punch, [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8385.64s)]
*  it can set you up way better by doing that. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8389.8s)]
*  This is way more penetrating. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8392.0s)]
*  Yes. And when you bring the elbow up. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8393.279999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the thing about Beheira that people don't give enough credit for. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8395.039999999999s)]
*  He's very clever and very technical, [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8398.08s)]
*  because everybody just thinks about the power. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8401.039999999999s)]
*  His power is so extraordinary. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8403.119999999999s)]
*  But then you realize like he's not hitting hard all the time. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8404.6s)]
*  He's not like a guy just like Melvin Manhoef. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8408.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Everything is. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8410.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Melvin was one of my all time favorites. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8412.2s)]
*  Monster. Oh, my God. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8415.08s)]
*  Mark Hunt knocking him out in one punch. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8416.800000000001s)]
*  And I think also the cup. Did you see that? [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8420.08s)]
*  I think I'm the only one who caught it. I go, well, so he knocks out Mark Hunt. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8422.720000000001s)]
*  Hunt flies down and Mark hits his head on his cup. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8427.12s)]
*  Is he wearing a tie cup? A steel cup? Yeah. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8431.880000000001s)]
*  So I think it's a double whammy. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8434.12s)]
*  I think already the punch was it. But boom, boom. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8435.68s)]
*  And then he goes down. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8437.960000000001s)]
*  I think it's crazy that they still let fighters wear steel cups. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8438.76s)]
*  I think it's crazy. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8442.640000000001s)]
*  But I think it's good because like you shouldn't really be kicking someone in the nuts anyway. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8443.84s)]
*  And if you kick someone in the nuts and you're going to shatter your foot [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8448.0s)]
*  because you're going to hit a steel cup. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8450.960000000001s)]
*  But so they won't allow it. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8452.76s)]
*  They do allow it. Oh, you have to. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8455.52s)]
*  I don't understand people not using a steel cup. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8457.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8459.92s)]
*  Either that or I think the diamond MMA system is excellent [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8460.960000000001s)]
*  because it's a compression cup and you can take a full blast shot to the nuts. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8464.48s)]
*  Did you try? Yeah. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8467.960000000001s)]
*  I've knocked on it a few times. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8469.68s)]
*  But I got a really bad dick injury once from Jiu Jitsu, from someone passing my guard. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8471.44s)]
*  That's what happened. I swear to God. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8477.52s)]
*  He is passing my guard and he tried to slam his knee through to pass my guard. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8479.64s)]
*  And I wasn't wearing a cup. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8486.48s)]
*  And he hit me right on the dick. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8488.16s)]
*  Not on my balls, on my dick. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8490.08s)]
*  And it hurt like hell, but I just kept going. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8491.92s)]
*  And then afterwards, I went into the locker room and my jockstrap had blood in it. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8494.6s)]
*  There's a bunch of blood in my jockstrap. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8498.56s)]
*  I was like, oh, Jesus. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8500.4s)]
*  And I pissed and blood was coming out of my dick. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8501.4s)]
*  I'm like, OK. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8503.2s)]
*  So I was like, do I go to the hospital or do I treat it like a broken nose? [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8504.52s)]
*  So what I did was I went home and I jerked off [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8509.0s)]
*  because I figured if my dick still works, then I'm not worried about it. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8512.8s)]
*  And the fucking I jerked off into the toilet bowl. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8516.68s)]
*  This is how gross it is. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8520.28s)]
*  And this fucking disgusting thing came out. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8521.44s)]
*  I go, OK, well, let's see if it works tomorrow. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8526.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I want to make sure it's not infected. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8528.28s)]
*  And I never went up doing anything with it. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8530.880000000001s)]
*  But, you know, people like, but it's your dick. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8532.560000000001s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, but if it was really if I really was worried, you know, [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8534.24s)]
*  I mean, it's an injury. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8539.08s)]
*  Your nose is always bleeding, right? [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8540.400000000001s)]
*  How many times you've broken your nose? [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8542.36s)]
*  Listen, I did the same thing. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8544.12s)]
*  I'm standing at the end of the classes, just a sparring session. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8545.6s)]
*  And I have teaching kids class. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8548.56s)]
*  And I'm standing in front of the mirror, pushing my nose straight [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8550.92s)]
*  because it got broke again in training. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8553.0s)]
*  So this guy walks in who has two sons with me. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8554.68s)]
*  And he says, hey, if you want, I can fix this. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8557.08s)]
*  I mean, what do you mean? He says, I'm a plastic surgeon. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8559.4s)]
*  I can put a plastic nose in there. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8561.640000000001s)]
*  So I have a plastic nose. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8563.92s)]
*  Plastic? Yeah. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8566.0s)]
*  Oh, plastic silicone. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8566.92s)]
*  I can't break anymore. Yeah. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8568.68s)]
*  So he replaced this. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8569.960000000001s)]
*  So it's not a boxing nose, but I simply can't break anymore. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8571.16s)]
*  Oh, so you have this piece here instead of being hard like mine. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8574.48s)]
*  It's silicone. It's silicone. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8577.6s)]
*  Push it down again. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8579.039999999999s)]
*  It got cold. That is crazy. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8580.24s)]
*  So I didn't know they could do that. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8582.56s)]
*  Me neither. And he did it right away. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8584.68s)]
*  So that was it for free. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8587.039999999999s)]
*  I go, I'll take that. Wow. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8589.16s)]
*  That's nice. Yeah. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8591.16s)]
*  So I never had my head. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8592.64s)]
*  It was out of place, though, in the UFC when I fought Randleman. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8594.84s)]
*  It was on the side. Oh, no. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8597.84s)]
*  And that's when they asked me. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8599.92s)]
*  That was literally because it was funny [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8601.0s)]
*  that I think the day before or the day of the fight, I don't remember that. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8603.919999999998s)]
*  We were talking about the nose bone into the brain. Right. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8607.759999999998s)]
*  Oh, that's a myth. It's bullshit. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8610.24s)]
*  But then a friend of mine says to me, if your nose is already broken, [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8612.4s)]
*  then it might happen. Right. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8616.519999999999s)]
*  So this is in my head. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8618.199999999999s)]
*  So now, boss, your nose is broke. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8619.24s)]
*  And then you say, I look at Big John, I say, [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8621.56s)]
*  do you believe that nose bone into the brain? [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8624.32s)]
*  He wrote that in his book. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8627.72s)]
*  That's hilarious. He goes, no, I say, oh, fuck it. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8629.32s)]
*  I'll write. Yeah, I was always mad about the hit you right in the nose [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8631.16s)]
*  and go right in your brain. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8635.88s)]
*  No, but it's just people, they always say, oh, I'd like to die in a cage. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8636.96s)]
*  Not me. I like my life. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8639.4s)]
*  I'm very happy living. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8641.76s)]
*  You know, I don't want to die if there's a reason, a possibility I might die. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8643.48s)]
*  No, I'm not going to do it. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8648.56s)]
*  I'm not going to take the risk. Why would I? [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8650.16s)]
*  Yeah, why would you? [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8651.76s)]
*  So many people in the UFC, I mean, Justin Gaethje just got his nose fixed. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8653.32s)]
*  He had a deviated septum and you think. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8656.92s)]
*  But his nose was so closed off. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8660.919999999998s)]
*  What he would talk, you would you would hear it like this. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8663.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we talked like that. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8665.64s)]
*  You could hear that his nose is always stuffed up. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8666.72s)]
*  And there's so many fighters that you hear him talk. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8668.88s)]
*  And that was me until I was 40. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8671.24s)]
*  And I finally got a deviated septum operation. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8673.679999999998s)]
*  They cleaned out my nose and I got. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8676.48s)]
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8679.08s)]
*  It was amazing. I used to go to yoga class. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8681.759999999998s)]
*  And the guy was like, you got to breathe out your nose. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8684.519999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I can't. He's like, you can't. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8686.599999999999s)]
*  I go, no, I can't. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8688.56s)]
*  My nose is done. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8690.08s)]
*  That's like this. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8691.119999999999s)]
*  Just like the inside of my nose was like cauliflower ear. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8691.92s)]
*  Yeah, the same kind of shit, because if you get it broken enough, [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8695.16s)]
*  it the blood pools up and it calcifies. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8697.56s)]
*  Yeah. So the doctor had to clean it out. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8700.359999999999s)]
*  And he showed me all the shit that he cleaned out of my nose after it was over. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8702.0s)]
*  It's like a little cup. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8704.8s)]
*  Yeah. Filled with just fucking horrible shit that was inside my. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8705.88s)]
*  But afterwards. Oh, my God. Freedom. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8709.199999999999s)]
*  I had it's like almost like your Tesla. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8712.6s)]
*  Anybody who needs that, please listen to me. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8715.76s)]
*  Get it done. Get it done. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8718.560000000001s)]
*  Get your deviated septum fixed. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8720.12s)]
*  I know six weeks. I know. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8722.12s)]
*  But six weeks later, I was rolling. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8724.0s)]
*  I was training again. It goes fast. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8725.68s)]
*  But it was just the difference. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8727.400000000001s)]
*  My cardio was up by 10 percent, like immediately. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8728.800000000001s)]
*  Oh, immediately. Yeah. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8731.04s)]
*  Everything becomes better. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8732.08s)]
*  Calmness. I could smell. Calm down. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8733.2s)]
*  I couldn't smell shit. You could fart in my face. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8735.84s)]
*  I didn't know what was going on. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8737.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And with food, that's the problem. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8738.76s)]
*  Oh, with food is a real problem. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8740.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. If you can smell the wine. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8742.12s)]
*  I had that one time for like a couple of months. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8743.48s)]
*  You could smell anything. You could blow smoke in my face. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8745.48s)]
*  Whatever. And then you don't taste the steaks. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8748.24s)]
*  No, nothing. The red wine sauce. Nothing. The wine. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8750.439999999999s)]
*  Oh, this is a very expensive bottle of wine. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8753.119999999999s)]
*  They don't give it to me. It's a waste. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8754.68s)]
*  I mean, yeah. Just give me the alcohol. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8756.68s)]
*  What percentage is that? Double that. Bring it back. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8760.76s)]
*  Yeah, man. The nose thing is such a problem because noses are so vulnerable. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8763.24s)]
*  It's such a soft, stupid thing to have that right in the middle of your face [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8768.039999999999s)]
*  where you're getting hit all the time. But it's in training. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8771.92s)]
*  In training. I never had it in fighting. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8773.72s)]
*  Well, Randleman. But Randleman's punches, he was hitting me [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8775.44s)]
*  and sliding over my face. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8779.52s)]
*  So he hit it completely out of the socket. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8781.2s)]
*  You know, that wasn't good. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8783.8s)]
*  And another thing that wasn't good is that I lost a contact. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8785.12s)]
*  I have bad eyes, like minus five and a half. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8787.88s)]
*  Like if I'm sitting in front of you and you look down, [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8790.12s)]
*  your face is straight and you look down. I can't tell. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8793.4s)]
*  You know, so I was always wearing contacts in the fight. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8795.68s)]
*  And then one eye, I lost the contact. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8798.8s)]
*  And then the other eye was filled up with blood. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8801.6s)]
*  And then I'm upside down the whole time on my back, swallowing the blood. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8803.64s)]
*  That's why you see me in the corner. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8806.84s)]
*  I try to throw blood up, you know, I'm swallowing my own blood. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8809.36s)]
*  That was making me nauseous. Yeah. It's just annoying. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8812.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8815.8s)]
*  But, you know, when you look back on your career, boss, like you, [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8817.68s)]
*  you were, in my opinion, you were the first guy that I ever saw [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8821.6s)]
*  that was like a very high level striker that was entering into MMA. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8826.64s)]
*  Because a lot of MMA striking in the early, early, early days, [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8831.24s)]
*  it's kind of or the Alendo V was good, but he was very small. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8835.08s)]
*  Very small. He was like 180 pounds. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8838.44s)]
*  And he's fighting these like he fought Remco Pardue. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8840.48s)]
*  Remember that fight? Oh, yeah, of course. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8843.08s)]
*  And I bought these guys a train for the both of them. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8844.52s)]
*  Remco got him inside control and just bringing elbow, elbow, elbow. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8846.199999999999s)]
*  Freaking those. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8849.44s)]
*  You were the first guy, like especially the Kosaka fight. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8851.32s)]
*  Pull up that fight. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8854.32s)]
*  Pull up when Boss Rutan made his debut, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8855.48s)]
*  because they put a lot of pressure on you to. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8858.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The poster, the poster of the UFC for that event [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8860.52s)]
*  was the greatest martial artist alive. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8865.08s)]
*  Yeah. And I said they messed up right there. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8868.16s)]
*  I told him specifically the greatest looking. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8869.800000000001s)]
*  And they pulled the word looking up. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8874.84s)]
*  Yeah, man, I had that poster for the longest time. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8877.08s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck ever happened with it. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8879.4s)]
*  It's just the next you see. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8880.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, man, it was just your face. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8881.960000000001s)]
*  The poster of that UFC event was just your face. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8884.16s)]
*  It was badass. Yeah. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8887.32s)]
*  This is boss puppy. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8888.76s)]
*  So for me, this is UFC 18. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8890.4s)]
*  And this was Jesus. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8892.6s)]
*  I don't think I was working for the UFC anymore. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8894.359999999999s)]
*  I worked for the UFC for UFC 12 to probably like 16 or something. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8896.56s)]
*  98. Yeah. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8901.279999999999s)]
*  I think by 98, I was already done because they were [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8902.76s)]
*  because I never was there for one of your fights, was I? [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8906.84s)]
*  No. I only watched it on television. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8909.52s)]
*  But I remember watching you fight. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8911.359999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is exciting because this was the first time [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8913.0s)]
*  we saw like a real elite striker. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8916.64s)]
*  And again, I have to tell people you couldn't even fucking spar. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8919.800000000001s)]
*  You couldn't wrestle for this fight because you had a fucked up neck. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8923.24s)]
*  And Tio Chico Saka was an elite guy. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8926.800000000001s)]
*  He trained with Maury Smith. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8928.960000000001s)]
*  He was a very, very good guy. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8930.24s)]
*  But this fucking this final right here, this final barrage. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8931.560000000001s)]
*  When you won your UFC debut, I mean, I was that to me as an MMA fan [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8937.44s)]
*  and as a martial artist was very exciting. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8943.08s)]
*  Oh, I had so much because John put it in his book as well. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8946.36s)]
*  I walked back to the corner after the first round [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8949.68s)]
*  and I knew I was getting behind because I couldn't do any [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8952.400000000001s)]
*  take down defense because of the the ground was hard for me because of my neck. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8955.160000000002s)]
*  And while I'm walking up, I see the word look on the guy's his faces. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8959.28s)]
*  And I go, I said, don't worry about it. I got him. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8962.320000000002s)]
*  I say, you just shout what I have one minute left and I'll knock him out. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8964.6s)]
*  And I turn around and Big John stands here with a smile on his face. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8967.76s)]
*  So he turns around and he's like shaking his head. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8971.800000000001s)]
*  He just heard me say. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8974.28s)]
*  And then they go to the fight. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8975.640000000001s)]
*  He goes, what minute? [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8976.84s)]
*  And 10 seconds later, I knocked him out. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8977.92s)]
*  And then Big John gave me his shirt. Oh, wow. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8979.52s)]
*  He goes, dude, that was the wildest thing. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8982.2s)]
*  So he gave it to show that he was wearing indicates afterwards. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8984.880000000001s)]
*  That's the picture. Look at that. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8987.52s)]
*  Is this the next UFC heavyweight champion? Yeah, that's cool. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8989.12s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8992.28s)]
*  Make that a little bit bigger so I can read it. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8994.400000000001s)]
*  What is it? What does it say on anything? [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8996.28s)]
*  Look at that. Boss root and. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=8998.16s)]
*  The world's greatest martial artist. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9000.480000000001s)]
*  Look at that. No pressure. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9004.04s)]
*  Live on pay per view. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9005.84s)]
*  That was a big deal, man. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9007.28s)]
*  The way it was in the hotel room. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9008.76s)]
*  You know, the way it was a hotel room. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9011.08s)]
*  Yeah, those wins were just ridiculous. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9013.28s)]
*  Yeah. And also the drug testing was ridiculous. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9015.04s)]
*  Oh, shoot. Yeah. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9017.560000000001s)]
*  It was what drug testing? [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9018.800000000001s)]
*  It was nothing. Yeah, crazy. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9021.320000000002s)]
*  What a fucking career you had, though, man. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9023.960000000001s)]
*  I love it. You're such an important part of MMA history. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9025.76s)]
*  Huge, huge part. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9029.72s)]
*  I'm very happy everybody's coming to me. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9031.32s)]
*  They always say the same thing. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9033.119999999999s)]
*  You know, what if you could have fought now? [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9034.64s)]
*  And I go, I'm completely happy. You know why? [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9036.24s)]
*  Because all the champs you're going to get now, that's good. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9038.56s)]
*  We're in the pioneer section. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9040.68s)]
*  That means that can only be a certain group. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9042.16s)]
*  It can never get bigger. Yeah. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9044.48s)]
*  We were the guys who started it. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9045.88s)]
*  I said that will be forever there. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9046.96s)]
*  Five thousand years from now, we started. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9048.64s)]
*  Yes. That's cool. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9051.0s)]
*  I enjoy that. Yes. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9052.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you you were a very, very important part of MMA [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9054.96s)]
*  history, again, because you were the first, like, really elite striker. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9059.04s)]
*  In the UFC, when you saw guys who were good strikers, [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9064.36s)]
*  who were solid guys, but you are a cut above. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9067.400000000001s)]
*  And it was it was a very exciting time. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9070.720000000001s)]
*  And it was also the time where you're sorting all this out. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9072.720000000001s)]
*  We got you have to realize if you go back to UFC 18, [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9076.400000000001s)]
*  people were still sorting out what's what's effective, what's not effective. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9078.880000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. What you know, this this Mark Coleman came along. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9083.480000000001s)]
*  And also, everybody wanted to be 265 pounds [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9087.0s)]
*  because he was taking everybody down, smashing and holding hands. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9089.4s)]
*  And it's not about people. Yeah. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9092.8s)]
*  Head butts were legal. Yes. Yeah. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9094.92s)]
*  Jesus. Head butts. No, no gloves. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9097.64s)]
*  When when Mark Coleman fought Dan Severin, the first UFC in UFC 12. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9100.52s)]
*  No gloves, no gloves. Yeah. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9106.12s)]
*  You know, they just taped up the base of the hand to keep your hand together. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9108.4s)]
*  If it broke. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9112.44s)]
*  Did this the story that I heard because I talked to Ken, of course, [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9113.32s)]
*  because first time when I was fighting in Japan was September. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9116.68s)]
*  And Ken was talking to me that he was going to do this crazy thing. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9119.28s)]
*  Can't shamrock. Can't shamrock. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9122.2s)]
*  I go, dude, because I was in November. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9124.76s)]
*  This was in September. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9126.84s)]
*  And he went. Did this thing. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9127.960000000001s)]
*  And then afterwards, I talked to him. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9130.44s)]
*  He said it was hilarious. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9131.84s)]
*  There was a moment in time [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9133.0s)]
*  that everybody was sitting backstage and they were watching the fights. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9135.12s)]
*  And everybody was expecting that any moment now the promoter could come in [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9138.48s)]
*  and would say, OK, you're going to lose. You're going to win. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9141.92s)]
*  You know, they write because they still thought it should be fixed [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9143.88s)]
*  because otherwise it's too crazy. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9146.8s)]
*  And then they saw she asked, are you kicking the teeth out from the sumo guy? [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9148.8s)]
*  And they go like, it's real. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9152.759999999998s)]
*  He was a reality check right there in the dressing room. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9154.759999999998s)]
*  He said, you saw all everybody's demeanor changed. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9159.08s)]
*  The moment that happened. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9162.8s)]
*  And I think one of the most important things was that hoist one [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9164.119999999999s)]
*  because you got this guy who didn't look the scat. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9167.08s)]
*  Me, Ken Shamrock was fucking jacked. Yeah. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9170.0s)]
*  He was just jacked. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9173.56s)]
*  He looked like a UFC champion. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9175.08s)]
*  Yeah. He looked like what everyone was terrified of. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9177.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And hoist Gracie tapped him. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9179.119999999999s)]
*  And he was like one hundred seventy five pounds and skinny and wearing a key. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9181.96s)]
*  And everybody's like, what is going on? How is this possible? [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9185.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was I was I was going through all my magazines [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9188.48s)]
*  because I wanted to clean out that take out of the magazines, make pictures of it, [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9191.72s)]
*  because otherwise you have way too many magazines like these Japanese [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9194.92s)]
*  badass magazines where you have a fight. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9197.52s)]
*  You got like eight pages of pictures and they have the best pictures. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9199.72s)]
*  And one of the magazines was hoist on the cover, [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9203.92s)]
*  you know, and he's lifting his arm and the look in his eyes. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9207.88s)]
*  I actually made a picture and I sent it to him. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9210.52s)]
*  I go, where is this guy? [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9212.32s)]
*  You know, because freaking violence. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9213.96s)]
*  Yeah. He just won. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9216.68s)]
*  No smile is like, I kill everybody next. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9219.64s)]
*  That was badass. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9222.72s)]
*  And didn't have a lot of experience doing that. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9223.96s)]
*  Yeah. It wasn't like he had had a lot of MMA fights. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9226.4s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of no rules fights. His brother Hickson did. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9229.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Hickson fought a bunch of them. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9231.92s)]
*  But Jesus Christ. Yeah. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9233.92s)]
*  That changed martial arts. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9235.64s)]
*  Everything. Everybody. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9237.08s)]
*  1993 changed the fucking world. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9238.6s)]
*  Yeah. Changed the fucking world. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9241.08s)]
*  Yeah. We all thought 30 years ago. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9242.8s)]
*  Yeah. Not crazy. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9245.44s)]
*  I know. I remember the first time I watched it, it was like [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9246.56s)]
*  there was two big revelations for me in my martial arts. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9249.44s)]
*  One was going from taekwondo to kickboxing [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9253.4s)]
*  and realizing how easy it was for me to get punched in the face. Yeah. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9257.56s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God, because I thought that I was just going to kick people [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9260.2s)]
*  in the face and knock them unconscious. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9263.12s)]
*  I was like, these guys aren't even that good at kicking. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9264.52s)]
*  Yeah. You know, because I came from this elite taekwondo. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9266.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And then I was getting just fucking battered in training. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9268.720000000001s)]
*  I was like, oh, God, maybe reassess and then leg kicks. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9272.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. The leg kick one was like, oh, fuck. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9275.960000000001s)]
*  And then the next one was jujitsu. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9278.76s)]
*  My taekwondo teacher had that too. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9281.12s)]
*  I came back from taekwondo and he said also, he said, like kicks. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9283.0s)]
*  It's not effective. Say it once more. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9286.240000000002s)]
*  And then when I tied it to get you, she just check it. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9288.560000000001s)]
*  I go, you're wrong, because I keep you busy. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9291.16s)]
*  And then I start nailing him in it and he goes, we're going to add logics. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9293.44s)]
*  Yeah. For me, it was 1988. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9298.92s)]
*  My friend, Dana Rosenblatt, his buddy from Richie Vasapoli's Karate [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9302.16s)]
*  studio was this guy was very adventurous guy who I forget his name, [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9307.36s)]
*  but he went over to Thailand and he trained in Thailand for quite a long time. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9312.0s)]
*  And he came back all cut up because he had a bunch of Thai fights [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9315.56s)]
*  and he got cut with elbows. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9318.519999999999s)]
*  And this guy was living in Thailand and training in Thailand in 1988. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9320.0s)]
*  And I was like, whoa, like, what is going on? [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9324.519999999999s)]
*  And that's when I first started incorporating that and start learning logics. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9326.64s)]
*  But I was like, oh, my God, I'm so vulnerable. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9330.56s)]
*  Like, you didn't realize how vulnerable your legs were. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9332.48s)]
*  And especially because you never did it. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9334.8s)]
*  So it's all tender. Right. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9336.68s)]
*  It's the ultimate chargers. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9338.6s)]
*  I had a terrible stance for it, too, because I stood very wide. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9339.72s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I was like very wide like this. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9343.0s)]
*  Boom. Oh, no. Yeah. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9345.4s)]
*  And that was before calf kicks, which is crazy. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9348.36s)]
*  Like, you know, I talked to Michael Bisping and he's like, I fought my entire career. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9350.52s)]
*  Won the world title. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9354.28s)]
*  He won the world title. Never got calf kicked. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9355.68s)]
*  Yeah. Which is that what's so interesting. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9357.76s)]
*  Yeah. But it's the same. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9360.36s)]
*  You know, we don't still don't see clotheslines. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9362.24s)]
*  And we don't see, you know, those are punches that you can defend. Sure. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9364.039999999999s)]
*  If I give you a clothesline, it will loop around. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9367.64s)]
*  It will still hit the back of your head. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9369.72s)]
*  The legal part, you know, you just stay outside of the mohawk. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9371.039999999999s)]
*  Where are they? Right. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9375.119999999999s)]
*  You know, we saw with Junior dos Santos and McCain when they were fighting. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9376.32s)]
*  He dropped him and I go, ah, here we go. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9379.36s)]
*  And then the next fight in the rematch, it went the other way around. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9381.6s)]
*  Oh, finally, people got it. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9384.48s)]
*  And then it disappeared again. I go, dude, it is such an effective. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9386.08s)]
*  If I get in the street fight right now, I clothesline the guy. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9389.36s)]
*  That's the first thing I'm going to try it out. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9393.119999999999s)]
*  Just full stiff arm. You have no clue. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9394.52s)]
*  If I do this on the back, I can give you a head kick full [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9396.6s)]
*  and I give you clothesline clothesline beats the head kick. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9400.76s)]
*  If I hit the back, you'll see the whole back fold around my arm. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9404.08s)]
*  It's bizarre. It's really bizarre. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9407.68s)]
*  You can be in full defense. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9410.04s)]
*  It'll go around, punk hits the back of your head. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9411.400000000001s)]
*  How come no one's doing that? [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9413.84s)]
*  I no clue. Completely illegal. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9414.880000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's the next thing. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9417.08s)]
*  Maybe they're going to learn it from this. I hope so. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9418.08s)]
*  Because I never think of that. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9420.04s)]
*  But there is a lot of power. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9421.240000000002s)]
*  But the one thing don't stretch your arm, because if you if you do, [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9423.0s)]
*  if you hyper extends, you know, so it's better you want to have a slight bend, [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9426.76s)]
*  slight bend. And I hit with this part. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9430.480000000001s)]
*  If you see me doing this on the back, it's it's a very scary thing. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9433.679999999998s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yeah, I see. We got a bag. Yeah. Well, we'll do it. OK. Yeah. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9437.88s)]
*  I'll film it. I'll film it. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9442.0s)]
*  I'll show everybody. Yeah. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9443.64s)]
*  But yeah, whatever the you know, here's another one [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9445.359999999999s)]
*  that really never made it into the UFC, but it has been in other organizations [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9447.839999999998s)]
*  is axe kicks. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9451.24s)]
*  Oh, there's there's this one gentleman. I forget his name. Andy Hoog. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9452.64s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9456.4s)]
*  And who got caught in the hook? [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9457.679999999998s)]
*  I mean, Andy Hoog was the master. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9459.599999999999s)]
*  He was. Oh, my God. Those K one days. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9461.6s)]
*  Oh, to this day. Yeah. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9463.92s)]
*  We just thought how the fuck explain this. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9465.640000000001s)]
*  How does pride go from 90,000 seats? [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9469.08s)]
*  I Thomas Super Arena to. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9473.12s)]
*  There's nothing like that over there in Japan now. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9476.56s)]
*  Like, how did it just go away? [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9478.880000000001s)]
*  That's once once they realized that the mafia was associated with it. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9480.48s)]
*  Yeah. Mike Bonanno. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9485.0s)]
*  That's oh, yeah. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9487.32s)]
*  He was a great guy. He killed himself. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9488.68s)]
*  Mike Bonanno. Yeah. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9491.199999999999s)]
*  Poor guy. He was. I liked him a lot. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9492.519999999999s)]
*  Boom. Look at that. Yeah. He's. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9494.84s)]
*  And you look at it. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9497.92s)]
*  Boom. Miracle croak up. Yeah. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9499.679999999998s)]
*  Donk. Yeah. Andy Hoog was the master of the axe kick. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9501.92s)]
*  It's just so flexible. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9504.64s)]
*  It's just there's one guy who fights in the UFC. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9505.84s)]
*  Excuse me. Fights in MMA. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9509.72s)]
*  I've messaged him back and forth. I apologize to him. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9511.76s)]
*  I just get too many messages. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9514.359999999999s)]
*  But there was a video of him KOing somebody with an axe kick. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9515.84s)]
*  I'm like, oh, well, there you go. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9519.119999999999s)]
*  He was like this elite Taekwondo guy, then started training in MMA [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9520.560000000001s)]
*  and just has this crazy axe kick. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9523.76s)]
*  And you just don't expect it. Yeah. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9526.32s)]
*  You know, and nobody does, especially if you're fighting someone [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9527.880000000001s)]
*  and they're standing south park and they have that right shoulder forward [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9531.44s)]
*  and he brings it around the outside. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9535.4s)]
*  So you don't even see it until it's too late. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9536.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So you're standing like this. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9538.52s)]
*  You don't see it until it's oh, Jesus Christ coming down. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9540.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it slams. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9543.36s)]
*  And this with the heel anywhere. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9544.720000000001s)]
*  Colourbones. Oh, yeah. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9546.44s)]
*  I mean, everything is going to. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9547.560000000001s)]
*  Well, this is really good at the face. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9548.52s)]
*  He's see if you can find it. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9550.6s)]
*  Let me see that. This is the kid. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9552.84s)]
*  Watch this. Watch this. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9555.640000000001s)]
*  Boom. Whoa. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9558.28s)]
*  Yeah. What is his name? [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9559.92s)]
*  What is this guy's name? [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9563.84s)]
*  There it is. Alfie Davis, Alfie Davis. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9565.4s)]
*  That's yeah. So Alfie Davis, this this gentleman has a background [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9568.0s)]
*  in Taekwondo, clearly, if you watch back it up a little bit [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9571.960000000001s)]
*  so you can see a little bit more of it. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9574.720000000001s)]
*  But we'll show some more of his fights, too, [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9576.6s)]
*  because he does this a lot. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9578.68s)]
*  I don't know where he's at right now, [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9580.720000000001s)]
*  but he had that sort of Taekwondo style. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9582.16s)]
*  Look at this steps for boom. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9586.32s)]
*  And you don't just don't anticipate it. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9588.48s)]
*  You think he's going to kick you in the body. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9590.52s)]
*  So you're doing this. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9592.32s)]
*  And also his foot is over his head. Yeah. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9593.28s)]
*  See if there's more [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9596.84s)]
*  videos of him. Incredible. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9599.0s)]
*  Is there more of those? [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9603.32s)]
*  It's the same one. Yeah. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9605.2s)]
*  So there's other fights of his. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9607.800000000001s)]
*  So he fights. Does he still fight in Bellator? [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9609.6s)]
*  Says that seven months ago. Anyway. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9611.720000000001s)]
*  So watching these guys that have these extraordinary kicking skills, [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9615.92s)]
*  as long as they learn the other stuff. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9620.76s)]
*  But the thing is about learning the other stuff. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9623.04s)]
*  It's everything. Yeah, it's everything. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9625.880000000001s)]
*  Do you know with me last lost by Ken, Kneebar me. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9628.28s)]
*  And that was it. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9632.68s)]
*  I go like, OK, I'm not going to learn this freaking game. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9633.32s)]
*  I'm going to stop. This is stupid. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9635.88s)]
*  You know, I might win the title, but then if somebody submits, [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9637.56s)]
*  you're losing again. It makes no sense. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9640.4s)]
*  It's it's my job. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9642.039999999999s)]
*  And I found one training partner. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9643.64s)]
*  I would just start rolling two or three times a day. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9645.36s)]
*  I won my next eight fights by submission after my last loss. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9647.44s)]
*  They were like, what the heck is going on? [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9650.72s)]
*  It was flipped around one with submission control. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9651.96s)]
*  The other one all finishes seven. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9654.24s)]
*  Do you think that's what you call ADHD or obsessive, whatever it is? [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9655.76s)]
*  Like 100 percent. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9660.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I focus on that. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9662.04s)]
*  Like with me, if if I want something, I want it now. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9663.68s)]
*  If I can't have it now, it will be happening tomorrow. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9666.76s)]
*  I'll do everything in my power to master whatever I need to master [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9668.800000000001s)]
*  in the shortest amount of time, and I will sacrifice everything for it. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9672.12s)]
*  That was always my thing. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9675.160000000002s)]
*  You know, like my stamina, you know, it was I was a severe asthma patient. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9676.960000000001s)]
*  I was scared to inhale it with me. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9681.400000000001s)]
*  So I didn't want to get tired. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9683.36s)]
*  So it was my weakness. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9685.160000000002s)]
*  And then I realized, wait a minute, I why don't I brainwash myself? [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9686.68s)]
*  And I started doing it. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9690.92s)]
*  I start getting tired. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9693.0s)]
*  And it was critical. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9694.04s)]
*  No, I love this. I love this. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9695.16s)]
*  I want to get more tired. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9696.800000000001s)]
*  And I kept on hitting and then I slowly and I'm telling you, [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9697.6s)]
*  like within three, four weeks, now I certainly wanted it. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9700.480000000001s)]
*  And that changed my whole. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9704.04s)]
*  That's when I started really training, [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9705.480000000001s)]
*  being trained to the next level that I read. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9708.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, if I can do with that, I should be able to do this with everything. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9710.36s)]
*  You know, that's when I start toughening up and, you know, all these things, [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9714.560000000001s)]
*  shin calcification, all this stuff. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9717.68s)]
*  I never focused on that. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9719.4s)]
*  But then I go, hey, why not? [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9721.279999999999s)]
*  You know, if everything is strong and it feels better for your opponent, [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9723.52s)]
*  it's going to feel much stronger. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9726.32s)]
*  So let's start working on that. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9728.16s)]
*  And then that was it. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9729.4s)]
*  What did you do for shin calcification? [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9730.359999999999s)]
*  Just kicking a bag. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9732.08s)]
*  But we had a I have to say this, we had a bag with regular sand in it. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9733.0s)]
*  So then the lower you kick it. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9737.32s)]
*  So what I would do, I will put in a measuring tape around it. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9738.72s)]
*  So I knew the exact spot, place the spot, [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9744.44s)]
*  and I will kick that for like the next 10 days only there. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9746.96s)]
*  And then only when I felt it's OK, I would do it one line below it, [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9749.64s)]
*  like literally this, and I would start kicking that. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9754.24s)]
*  First of all, great for my aiming, you know? [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9756.72s)]
*  And second of all, you know, every time it gets harder, [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9760.76s)]
*  the lower I kick, it gets harder. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9762.84s)]
*  By the way, aiming for people is so important, you know? [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9764.359999999999s)]
*  And you go like, oh, dude, it's not normal. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9767.8s)]
*  You see a lot of guys just hit the head, just hit the body. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9770.96s)]
*  They don't really aim for the shots. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9773.359999999999s)]
*  Like if I'm if I'm Thai boxing you and you're wearing shorts, [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9775.72s)]
*  or they're shorts, whatever logo is on there, [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9778.8s)]
*  I'll pick out one more one little piece on it, spot on it, [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9781.92s)]
*  and I will deliver my low kick, every low kick on the same spot. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9785.4s)]
*  Once you start training yourself like that, [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9788.359999999999s)]
*  you know, you automatically start doing it. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9790.32s)]
*  And think about this, if you have the power to knock somebody out [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9792.119999999999s)]
*  with with three low kicks, but you spread them out over three spaces, [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9794.72s)]
*  now you're going to need nine low kicks in order to do it. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9798.84s)]
*  So you see, so this is how if you kick me here in the gut, you can kick me, [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9801.4s)]
*  but you can't punch me here in the solar plexus. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9806.4s)]
*  OK, so why do not start hitting the solar plexus, the jaw, the spleen, the liver, [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9808.84s)]
*  you know, really aiming for your shots. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9813.56s)]
*  And that automatically puts you also better in the zone. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9815.4s)]
*  Because my first fights, I was hitting a silhouette. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9818.24s)]
*  I just hit whatever I could hit. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9821.56s)]
*  Didn't really matter where I would connect. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9823.56s)]
*  I just tried to finish the job. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9825.64s)]
*  Now I'm completely different. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9827.84s)]
*  Now it's like really waiting. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9829.64s)]
*  Oh, he's breathing in. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9831.24s)]
*  Oh, let's hit him at the moment. He's breathing in. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9832.119999999999s)]
*  You know, like this, my second fight, how I want that. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9833.92s)]
*  I use that a lot on your right kicks. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9835.960000000001s)]
*  If you throw a right kick and in my stance, well, you're exhaling when you kick. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9837.960000000001s)]
*  You're inhaling when you pull back. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9842.56s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to use that against you. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9844.68s)]
*  I'm going to block the kick. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9846.68s)]
*  And then while you pull it, recalling it, I go straight to the body. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9847.8s)]
*  That straight, this power, you go down. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9850.88s)]
*  You can do 5000 sit ups today. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9853.72s)]
*  You breathe in and I connect. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9855.88s)]
*  That's it. You're going to go down. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9857.6s)]
*  You see, and I really like those moments. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9859.48s)]
*  I do this with legs. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9861.76s)]
*  You know, I push you. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9863.48s)]
*  I push and simultaneously kick. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9864.84s)]
*  So I make you weightless. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9866.48s)]
*  The muscle is relaxed. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9867.6s)]
*  And then I kick you with the shin. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9868.88s)]
*  Sure, I cannot generate a lot of power, but you don't need a lot of power. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9870.359999999999s)]
*  It works really well. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9874.039999999999s)]
*  My last fight, actually, and that was not me time. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9875.4s)]
*  That was pure luck. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9878.24s)]
*  But he stepped at the moment his foot was up. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9879.76s)]
*  I kicked him and I remember my shin. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9882.439999999999s)]
*  I literally hit click. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9885.08s)]
*  My shin was touching his thigh bone. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9886.96s)]
*  I felt just a skid click. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9889.32s)]
*  I first thing I thought I won [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9891.44s)]
*  and I saw him limp and I kicked him one more time. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9894.64s)]
*  Fight was over. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9896.44s)]
*  But that was the moment that muscle was completely relaxed. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9897.56s)]
*  But like I said, that was not me timing it. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9899.92s)]
*  That was just luck. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9901.72s)]
*  Are you going to open up a gym out here? [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9903.48s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9905.279999999999s)]
*  I want to go do some seminars and do that kind of stuff. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9906.52s)]
*  I still own the gym in Thousand Oaks. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9910.68s)]
*  It's going really well. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9913.92s)]
*  We got this new great wrestling coaches now also. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9914.92s)]
*  They're going to start like in two weeks, I believe. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9918.32s)]
*  So we added wrestling now to it. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9920.52s)]
*  I mean, we got these crazy fitness challenges. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9922.640000000001s)]
*  What we do is a man challenge and a woman challenge. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9925.880000000001s)]
*  So the woman challenge, it's for six weeks. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9928.640000000001s)]
*  I'm going to pull up a picture. You're not going to believe this. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9931.4s)]
*  So this is a woman who won the competition. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9933.44s)]
*  You get a free membership for a year if you win the competition. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9935.84s)]
*  This is six weeks. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9939.4s)]
*  She gained actually two point one pounds. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9940.800000000001s)]
*  Watch this. Really? [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9945.0s)]
*  Well, six weeks. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9947.560000000001s)]
*  And all the other 18 ladies in the class, [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9950.439999999999s)]
*  they know this is 100 percent real because they want to be the number one. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9952.56s)]
*  So it's crazy, right? [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9955.24s)]
*  That's incredible. That's hard work. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9957.56s)]
*  That's hard work. And that's and then people don't know. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9959.119999999999s)]
*  This is the worst part. Don't you hate it when you know people see? [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9961.919999999998s)]
*  I was always, you know, like, oh, steroids. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9964.64s)]
*  They put if you if you look good. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9966.72s)]
*  And then these overweight people who don't take care of their health. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9969.32s)]
*  And the first thing they say, it's using steroids. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9972.16s)]
*  They say, wait a minute. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9974.32s)]
*  So you're using anti steroids then. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9975.4s)]
*  What do you mean? I say you look like shit. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9977.8s)]
*  You know, I'm firing right back when they do. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9979.68s)]
*  I can't stand it. You know, no. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9982.039999999999s)]
*  Live with me for two months. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9983.599999999999s)]
*  Well, you had phenomenal genetics, though. Yeah. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9985.96s)]
*  Don't you have that weird genetic variant that allows you to keep extra muscle? [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9988.439999999999s)]
*  Isn't there something? [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9992.48s)]
*  Do you know, don't you have something weird, though? [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9993.92s)]
*  I had an insanely high testosterone level when I was 19. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=9996.76s)]
*  I think I've toned it down to 2400. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10000.68s)]
*  But I think, no, I thought it was 2800. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10003.8s)]
*  Yeah, they said they never measured anything like it. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10006.84s)]
*  My mother was there with me. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10009.0s)]
*  And they go like, is he a handful? [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10010.64s)]
*  And she goes, you have no idea, you know, because she said, [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10012.08s)]
*  this is really crazy high level. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10014.28s)]
*  Yeah. And I burn like a maniac. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10017.6s)]
*  So I'm three percent of the population. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10019.72s)]
*  We did this swap, you know, for something. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10021.68s)]
*  I'm talking about. Yeah. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10023.6s)]
*  And it's like so I can eat six large pizzas a day. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10024.88s)]
*  I'm the same weight now. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10027.44s)]
*  Does that when I started fighting and never lose weight or gain weight? [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10028.68s)]
*  What do you do for exercise nowadays? [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10031.44s)]
*  I just work out 40 minutes. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10033.56s)]
*  I do stamina like this morning. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10035.88s)]
*  I did a treadmill. I do the incline all the way up. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10037.16s)]
*  And we have a higher one that goes like 25 percent, you know. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10039.64s)]
*  So it's pretty gnarly. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10042.64s)]
*  I've got a 30 percent one. It's awesome. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10043.88s)]
*  I love it. I need one like that. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10045.76s)]
*  Because my knees, I can run, but I can walk. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10047.92s)]
*  So then I just go up and I just go 40 minutes straight. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10051.08s)]
*  What I do is also I do [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10053.56s)]
*  10 minutes backwards and then I do another 10 minutes forward [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10055.64s)]
*  and then five minutes backwards. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10058.6s)]
*  Walking backwards is very important to balance everything out. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10059.92s)]
*  How are your knees are still fucked up? [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10062.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's no scarlet on the knee caps. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10064.48s)]
*  So that sounds like the easier problem is the worst problem [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10067.64s)]
*  to have in the knee because you can't fix it. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10069.96s)]
*  You know, it's not like they can put the take the knee cap out [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10072.36s)]
*  and replace it with it. It's not working like that. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10074.84s)]
*  But, you know, I do cable punch routines. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10077.119999999999s)]
*  Really good for your core, really good for power. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10080.32s)]
*  I do the reverse punches. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10082.52s)]
*  Everything I do is supersets. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10084.24s)]
*  So I do 10 exercises. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10086.28s)]
*  I do 20 repetitions, minimum all four sets. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10088.28s)]
*  32 minutes. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10091.6s)]
*  People go, there's no way. Yeah, but I don't take a rest. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10093.039999999999s)]
*  That's why I like to do supersets. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10095.2s)]
*  I'm resting. This muscle group is resting while I'm training this one. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10096.84s)]
*  So you're training strength, but you're also training conditioning. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10099.960000000001s)]
*  Always. Because that's in my head now. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10102.64s)]
*  What if something happens on the streets? [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10104.76s)]
*  Always good to have a little bit of gas in the tank. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10106.56s)]
*  So that's what I do. And I just watch my food. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10109.68s)]
*  But like crazy, I eat two, two and a half pounds of sweet potatoes. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10112.04s)]
*  That's my breakfast. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10115.36s)]
*  That's just that. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10117.36s)]
*  I'd have pounds of sweet potatoes. Yeah. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10118.36s)]
*  And then I just that no water, no salt, no nothing. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10120.92s)]
*  Just that. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10125.24s)]
*  Then I have these shakes, these crazy carnivore shakes that I have. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10126.44s)]
*  They're like 125 carbs a shake. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10130.12s)]
*  I doze a couple of days, drink them in between because they just keep burning. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10133.48s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, it's crazy. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10138.2s)]
*  But how old are you now? 58. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10140.6s)]
*  58. Your body's still burning like that. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10142.68s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10145.039999999999s)]
*  I grow like you see pictures of me like last week. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10145.96s)]
*  I started on Saturday because normally I always throw these challenges out. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10149.039999999999s)]
*  People say with steroids. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10152.039999999999s)]
*  I started TRT on Saturday last week because they realized that my free [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10153.04s)]
*  testosterone was lower and it was affecting me mentally. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10156.84s)]
*  It was like something wrong with him. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10159.88s)]
*  And I told Brigham, I go like, dude, [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10161.44s)]
*  something is wrong. I'm too emotional. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10164.64s)]
*  Something is off. You know, this is for a while already. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10166.84s)]
*  And I but I have pictures. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10170.0s)]
*  He says, dude, you look freaking awesome. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10171.64s)]
*  He says, yeah, and I don't use anything. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10173.08s)]
*  You know, so I was always very proud of that. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10174.52s)]
*  And to people who said it, I say, take the bet. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10176.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'll go six months. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10178.92s)]
*  Every day you can test me. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10180.6s)]
*  Every single day you might test me. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10181.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there are people out there that are just different. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10183.800000000001s)]
*  They're just different. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10186.44s)]
*  Yeah. You know, so now kind of because I was very proud of that. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10187.24s)]
*  But now I had to for my but and I have to say, though, I start [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10190.24s)]
*  like a weekend. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10194.84s)]
*  I worked out in in Miami on a treadmill. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10196.44s)]
*  No, I did a shadow boxing with my audio workout. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10200.2s)]
*  And after I just did some little bit of TRT, it's like only two points. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10203.04s)]
*  Five is like 50 milligrams. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10207.04s)]
*  And then I saw a guy I texted him. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10208.68s)]
*  I go, I'm feeling good now. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10210.84s)]
*  Mentally, I feel different. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10212.6s)]
*  So it is something doing doing something to your mental state as well. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10214.32s)]
*  I had no clue. For sure. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10218.24s)]
*  That's a big thing with guys that have pituitary gland injuries [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10219.44s)]
*  when they get depression. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10223.4s)]
*  That's a lot of it is your body is not producing testosterone anymore. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10225.68s)]
*  You see, so I'm very happy I started with that. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10229.24s)]
*  Everything also, I had this wound on my that I cut myself with a knife, [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10231.880000000001s)]
*  like really weird, opened up in my pocket while I was pulling my [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10235.880000000001s)]
*  pants up, something stupid. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10238.52s)]
*  But it was a cut. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10240.0s)]
*  It's been there for two years. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10241.28s)]
*  Really? I got my wife every time goes like you. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10242.880000000001s)]
*  But now when I started last week, it's almost gone now. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10245.84s)]
*  So it helps helps with that as well. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10249.0s)]
*  Although my my white blood cells were good. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10251.4s)]
*  Everything was good. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10253.84s)]
*  It was just my free testosterone was a little low. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10254.84s)]
*  Well, it's good to get everything checked. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10257.36s)]
*  It's that's ways to build. Well, it's fantastic for that. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10259.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's great to get everything checked. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10261.84s)]
*  And some great people. I Ron White walked in. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10263.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10265.960000000001s)]
*  No, Brigham is awesome. I love Brigham and and anybody that's listening. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10268.240000000002s)]
*  Listen to the podcast that I did with Brigham Bueller. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10272.400000000001s)]
*  It's it's an amazing podcast where he breaks down [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10275.320000000002s)]
*  all the problems in the medical system and all the problems [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10278.36s)]
*  with the insurance system and and that there's so many different things [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10282.560000000001s)]
*  that can benefit you that are fantastic for your health [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10286.76s)]
*  that are not covered by your insurance. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10290.28s)]
*  You know, it's just I know this is going to sound like a leadway, but breathing. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10292.640000000001s)]
*  Yes. What people don't have any idea about is that 95 percent [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10296.4s)]
*  is are breathing wrong. Incorrect. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10301.12s)]
*  Google it, because I was thinking I was being correct. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10303.08s)]
*  And if you if you stand in front of the mirror, you take a deep breath, [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10306.12s)]
*  you're raising your shoulders, you are breathing wrong. That's it. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10309.28s)]
*  Forty six of these shoulder raising breathes is the same as one belly breath. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10312.76s)]
*  Think take the lowest number four. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10317.64s)]
*  So imagine you come out of a hard fought round [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10320.24s)]
*  and you got one minute to recoup instead of 40 times raising your shoulders. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10322.92s)]
*  You can do the same amount of air by 10 times. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10326.08s)]
*  Not only that, if you're raising your shoulders, your neck, your traps, [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10328.48s)]
*  your neck muscles, everything needs oxygen. Right. Yeah. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10331.6s)]
*  You're lifting and lifting. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10334.68s)]
*  That's why fighters, people who are overweight, [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10335.6s)]
*  their breathing is much better than people who are lanky, lanky, [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10339.72s)]
*  because they don't want to carry that weight upwards all the time with breathing. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10343.76s)]
*  So they automatically start breathing diaphragmatically. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10347.52s)]
*  But that completely changed my life. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10350.72s)]
*  Really? It really is. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10353.400000000001s)]
*  Diaphragm breathing and then strengthening those inspiratory muscle training. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10354.960000000001s)]
*  It's not a gimmick. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10359.12s)]
*  Just go on a on a published medical website journal. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10360.240000000002s)]
*  You push in I empty. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10364.12s)]
*  You will have 1200 reports there about what it does. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10366.160000000002s)]
*  Every endurance athlete in the Olympics. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10368.720000000001s)]
*  Guess what they're doing? [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10370.6s)]
*  It's inspiratory muscle training. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10371.880000000001s)]
*  Well, you also have that that breath trainer that you developed. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10373.44s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10376.720000000001s)]
*  That's that's a device. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10378.04s)]
*  So just tell people about that. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10379.640000000001s)]
*  So OK, so I'm breaking this thing. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10381.880000000001s)]
*  What I want to say first is so you breathe wrong. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10383.84s)]
*  Don't say I woke up. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10386.6s)]
*  I've been breathing since I was a baby. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10388.84s)]
*  I know how to be. You don't. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10390.6s)]
*  That's good. Tell you about five and a half years of age. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10392.16s)]
*  And that's when we start breathing wrong. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10394.68s)]
*  And the reason is because that's the moment we start going to school. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10396.32s)]
*  And that's when we start wearing belts and sitting all day long in the classroom. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10399.28s)]
*  And that's when you go to the doctor and the doctor puts a stethoscope on your chest. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10402.24s)]
*  They take a deep breath. Oh, this is where my lungs are. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10405.28s)]
*  You know, that's what you think. But it's not the lungs are lower part here. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10407.36s)]
*  Let me stop this. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10410.48s)]
*  Then, of course, boys, girls, who you start get interested in the different sex. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10414.24s)]
*  And then suddenly you realize, wait a minute, if I keep breathing through my belly [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10418.96s)]
*  and they think I'm fat and this is literally the reason [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10421.839999999998s)]
*  that people start breathing the wrong. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10426.039999999999s)]
*  You know, we're the only animal, the only mammal that breathes wrong. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10427.919999999998s)]
*  Really? Only only the humans. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10432.0s)]
*  Everybody look at the baby. You see the belly breathe. Perfect. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10434.039999999999s)]
*  OK, so know this right now. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10437.48s)]
*  You're breathing wrong. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10439.36s)]
*  Ninety five percent of you are. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10440.44s)]
*  And if the five percent probably have breathing classes, you and bow hunting. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10441.92s)]
*  You think chest breathing is good [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10446.64s)]
*  or you think diaphragmatic breathing. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10448.96s)]
*  And if every sniper go to a Tim Kennedy, I guarantee you [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10451.24s)]
*  his freaking horizontal breathing diaphragmatic breathing. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10454.52s)]
*  So that's number one. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10458.0s)]
*  Then I go into the next attack. Nose breathing. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10459.36s)]
*  Because everybody says, I breathe through my nose. Yeah. OK. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10461.96s)]
*  What if I smash your nose in? What about that? [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10465.0s)]
*  What do you have a call to have to fight? [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10467.0s)]
*  Can breathe through your mouth. Come on, don't be stupid. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10468.4s)]
*  Yeah, but this thing, you know, it works through the mouth. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10470.48s)]
*  You're only using it for about five minutes a day [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10472.88s)]
*  and it will strengthen your breathing muscles, which, by the way, [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10475.48s)]
*  you have 11 pounds of breathing muscles. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10477.76s)]
*  That's a lot. And with breathing muscles, I say the move for inhaling [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10480.0s)]
*  is your diaphragm and your intercostals, which are the muscles in between your ribs. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10484.119999999999s)]
*  The external intercostals are for inhaling. Expans your chest. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10487.72s)]
*  I'm going to go in a little bit how that works, [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10492.88s)]
*  because that's why I bought this weird thing here with me. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10495.76s)]
*  What do you got with this? [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10498.199999999999s)]
*  Weird is it's a steamer, a vegetable steamer. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10499.599999999999s)]
*  But I'll transform it into a diaphragm in a little bit. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10501.839999999998s)]
*  Why did you bring a vegetable steamer? [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10504.64s)]
*  You know, I'm going to show you. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10506.08s)]
*  So now let's take another part. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10509.48s)]
*  How does your endurance increase? [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10511.759999999998s)]
*  What do you think is the reason? [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10515.0s)]
*  You train really hard, I know. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10516.679999999998s)]
*  But what happens when you train really hard? [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10517.759999999998s)]
*  Do your recovery gets better? [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10520.599999999999s)]
*  You know, your body gets accustomed to it and conditioned. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10522.599999999999s)]
*  That's that's it. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10526.16s)]
*  You train the muscle over and over again. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10527.04s)]
*  It becomes more efficient. Right. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10529.0s)]
*  And the word efficient already says it uses less oxygen. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10530.48s)]
*  Therefore, your stamina increases. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10533.28s)]
*  Boom. OK, good. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10534.84s)]
*  Let's go to the next one. Metabore flex. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10536.44s)]
*  That's a nice word for gassing. Right. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10538.76s)]
*  So you're just guessing. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10540.92s)]
*  This is what happens when you're gassing. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10543.08s)]
*  Let's say you're running a hill, a very steep hill, a 45 degree angle. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10544.64s)]
*  It's a hard one, hard one, hard one. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10548.24s)]
*  And suddenly it feels like you hit the wall. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10549.68s)]
*  What happens at that moment is that your body starts redirecting oxygenated blood. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10552.48s)]
*  It takes it away from your legs because it sends it to your number one [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10556.880000000001s)]
*  priority in the body, which are your breathing muscles, [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10560.960000000001s)]
*  because if your breathing muscles don't work, you die. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10563.64s)]
*  If you can't expand your chest, you die. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10565.960000000001s)]
*  OK, so endurance works. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10568.2s)]
*  Muscle training over and over again gets more endurance. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10570.32s)]
*  OK, but my freaking intercostal and my diaphragm, they steal the blood. [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10572.880000000001s)]
*  Blood stealing is literally a medical term away from my limbs. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10577.880000000001s)]
*  As soon as I'm getting tired. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10581.160000000002s)]
*  OK, what if I update those 11 parts of breathing muscles? [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10582.880000000001s)]
*  What if I give them more endurance over and over again? [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10587.36s)]
*  So they become more efficient. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10590.560000000001s)]
*  Now you delay your gassing. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10592.2s)]
*  That's normally let's say happens here, happens there. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10593.640000000001s)]
*  That's why every single endurance athlete in the Olympics [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10596.84s)]
*  will actually use inspiratory muscle training. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10600.240000000002s)]
*  It blows my mind that you have coaches here. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10602.640000000001s)]
*  Oh, he's the coach of the year, coach of the year. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10606.44s)]
*  And they don't spend time on breathing. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10608.080000000002s)]
*  You're an idiot, a complete idiot. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10609.64s)]
*  You remember I was on your show and I said 15 to 20 percent, you get more. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10611.56s)]
*  Oh, I lied about that. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10615.0s)]
*  That's for 95 percent of the people. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10616.519999999999s)]
*  And the difference is more than that. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10618.4s)]
*  Whoa, that's a big statement. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10620.56s)]
*  Four to six of these breaths is the same as one. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10622.8s)]
*  It's a big thing. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10625.119999999999s)]
*  I can let you hear a message from [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10626.519999999999s)]
*  Leodo Machida, who was doing it for three months, got COVID [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10628.16s)]
*  then started training with his fighters. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10630.96s)]
*  He says, dude, I outworked everybody. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10632.72s)]
*  My breathing was so in control, he's freaking out. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10634.72s)]
*  That's how crazy it is. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10637.039999999999s)]
*  You see, so now and now you have to understand how breathing works, [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10638.68s)]
*  because we all believe that our lungs do the work. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10641.56s)]
*  Lungs are two bags. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10643.68s)]
*  You can't have strong lungs. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10645.08s)]
*  There's no muscle in your lung. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10646.800000000001s)]
*  If you cannot expand your chest, you die. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10648.720000000001s)]
*  So when you expand your chest, you create a vacuum between your body [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10651.76s)]
*  and your lungs, and that vacuum opens up your lungs. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10655.800000000001s)]
*  So for people who go like, oh, what is a vacuum? [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10658.960000000001s)]
*  Just imagine your lungs being glued to the inside of your body. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10661.36s)]
*  And if you expand your chest, that's how you pull the air in. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10664.4s)]
*  So if you think about this, your chest doesn't expand because you put air in it. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10667.119999999999s)]
*  Your chest expands. That's how you pull the air in. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10671.359999999999s)]
*  So that's a little weird thing to think about. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10673.92s)]
*  But just focus on that. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10676.4s)]
*  Now, this chest expansion, I already said, is done by a diaphragm [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10677.4s)]
*  in the intercostal. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10680.679999999998s)]
*  Now, Dr. Belisa Vranich, [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10681.96s)]
*  she's actually a person, a world renowned breathing expert. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10684.84s)]
*  Joey Diaz set me up with her. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10687.359999999999s)]
*  And Joey said, you should meet her. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10689.599999999999s)]
*  So I went to visit her on Fifth Avenue in New York in her office. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10691.84s)]
*  This is five, six years ago. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10696.199999999999s)]
*  First thing she does is measuring my chest expansion. Right. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10698.48s)]
*  So she and I know why she's doing that, because the more I can expand, [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10701.88s)]
*  the more air I can pull in my lungs. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10704.72s)]
*  So she says, OK, exhale, inhale. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10706.599999999999s)]
*  And she goes, no, no, it's not possible. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10708.8s)]
*  Do it again. And I do it again. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10711.16s)]
*  And she goes, wait. [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10712.84s)]
*  And she walks out, comes back with another doctor. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10714.119999999999s)]
*  I go, what's going on? She says. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10716.439999999999s)]
*  If I don't bring him, he's not going to believe it. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10718.84s)]
*  Go, what do you mean? [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10720.72s)]
*  I said, well, normally when somebody break our record by chest expansion, [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10721.519999999999s)]
*  it's like an eighth of an inch, maybe half. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10724.72s)]
*  You almost went two inches more than everybody else. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10726.56s)]
*  Let me see your chest expansion. Give me a breath. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10728.64s)]
*  It's these lower parts here that get completely expand. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10732.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but you see what you're doing? [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10737.72s)]
*  You see what you're doing? You're raising your shoulders. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10739.32s)]
*  Only focus on this. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10743.08s)]
*  You're still raising your shoulders. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10744.119999999999s)]
*  This thing is going to freak you out, man. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10746.24s)]
*  You're going to get just keep my shoulders down. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10747.76s)]
*  Grab the bottom of your chair. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10749.88s)]
*  Grab the bottom of your chair and then just [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10751.439999999999s)]
*  that's breathing with type. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10754.32s)]
*  Every person wants the stamina of who? [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10761.6s)]
*  Tony Ferguson, Michael Chandler. [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10764.199999999999s)]
*  My God, what do they do? [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10767.0s)]
*  Look at them breathe. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10768.92s)]
*  80% of the UFC fighters breathing, correct. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10770.88s)]
*  Those guys, you will not see any movement. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10775.039999999999s)]
*  They breathe perfect, and that's why they have the advantage. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10778.96s)]
*  So now watch this, right? [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10782.6s)]
*  So this is the diaphragm is a thin dome shaped muscle tendon mixture. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10784.48s)]
*  And this is it separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10790.279999999999s)]
*  Right. This side here is attached to the lower part of your rib cage. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10794.48s)]
*  That's where it's attached to. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10797.72s)]
*  And what this is what the diaphragm does is actually massages your intestines [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10799.119999999999s)]
*  and it's massages your heart as well. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10802.32s)]
*  It lines your spine. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10804.48s)]
*  You should read the reviews with people with back problems. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10805.96s)]
*  Back problems are gone. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10808.6s)]
*  This is all published medical journals, all backup. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10809.64s)]
*  This is what the diaphragm does. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10812.44s)]
*  It just expands. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10814.48s)]
*  It's exactly because from that angle, this is what it does. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10815.4s)]
*  It drops down. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10819.84s)]
*  It massages everything. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10821.039999999999s)]
*  It goes back, drops down. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10822.24s)]
*  But that drop down is an expansion. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10824.039999999999s)]
*  This happens in the center of your body. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10826.08s)]
*  That together with your intercostals will open up your chest. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10828.039999999999s)]
*  That exhaling is done by your obliques, your core and your internal intercostal [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10831.4s)]
*  muscles for the actual also very important muscle to train. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10835.72s)]
*  But if you train both at the same time, not good. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10838.56s)]
*  Both separately. Very good. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10842.199999999999s)]
*  So this one is an inspiratory muscle training. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10844.56s)]
*  I brought two for you so you can choose if you want a blue or a green one. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10847.24s)]
*  Listen, don't let the fool the loop fool you. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10851.4s)]
*  It's a simple, stupid. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10854.359999999999s)]
*  This is it. Yes. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10856.72s)]
*  Way training for your breathing muscles. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10857.72s)]
*  You can throw it against the wall. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10859.0s)]
*  You can step on. You can do anything. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10859.92s)]
*  You buy one. You never have to buy another one. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10861.199999999999s)]
*  It comes with 16 different settings. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10864.359999999999s)]
*  It's very basic. [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10866.759999999998s)]
*  Why does it look like this? [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10867.96s)]
*  Because I had the idea when I was 14. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10869.039999999999s)]
*  You think a 14 year old kid come up with electronics? [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10871.0s)]
*  No, this was it. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10873.08s)]
*  This was actually also the reason I could bypass all the the parents [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10874.16s)]
*  and I have the pen and for this. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10877.12s)]
*  So what it does is just controls the air intake. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10878.84s)]
*  So if you inhale, this side has a flap that will close off, [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10881.36s)]
*  which will force you to inhale to this side. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10885.68s)]
*  This one comes with 16 different settings. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10888.04s)]
*  Now, in the beginning, my asthma was cured within three weeks. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10890.52s)]
*  Imagine I was walking around with an inhaler everywhere I went. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10893.28s)]
*  Every workout session inhaler before every fight. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10897.16s)]
*  Inhaler before three weeks with this freaking prototype gone. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10900.560000000001s)]
*  Whoa. Now I'm up to something. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10905.28s)]
*  Said it to my friend in Holland who has asthma. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10907.28s)]
*  Eight days later, he calls me, dude, I want to sell them in Europe. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10909.48s)]
*  He's selling them in Europe right now. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10912.880000000001s)]
*  Asthma is gone. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10914.44s)]
*  I go, dude, we're up to something here. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10915.48s)]
*  Now I have a commercial. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10917.28s)]
*  If your asthma is not 70 or 80 percent gone or more in one month, [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10918.560000000001s)]
*  I'll give you money back. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10922.32s)]
*  But I'm going to need to see you doing the freaking four minutes a day, though, [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10924.04s)]
*  because we all go four minutes a day. I can do this. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10927.68s)]
*  No, you can't. We're all born to pussies. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10929.88s)]
*  Pussies, I say. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10931.8s)]
*  Pussy, I took it made an abbreviation for Puscillonomus. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10933.32s)]
*  Lack of courage, or determination or cowardly. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10936.599999999999s)]
*  That's what we are. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10939.24s)]
*  And I say we because we all are certain things. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10939.839999999998s)]
*  We just give up really fast. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10942.56s)]
*  Oh, we get away. I want an extra drink. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10944.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're a pussy. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10946.039999999999s)]
*  You see, Puscillonomus. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10947.0s)]
*  This one for you, since you are an athlete already. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10949.72s)]
*  I'll put this one on number. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10953.16s)]
*  I put you them for. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10955.759999999998s)]
*  So what you're doing is [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10957.439999999999s)]
*  you put it in your mouth. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10960.759999999998s)]
*  That's what he said. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10961.64s)]
*  And then you're going to and you exhale. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10963.199999999999s)]
*  So officially just try now for sitting straight. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10966.0s)]
*  OK. And keep your shoulders low and exhale completely. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10969.279999999999s)]
*  And then inhale by pressing your belly forward. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10972.8s)]
*  Explosive. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10977.0s)]
*  And then explosive inhale. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10979.4s)]
*  I see your chest coming a little. [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10982.44s)]
*  Keep it down. There we go. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10987.12s)]
*  That's core. Now we're doing it. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=10989.32s)]
*  This is just sitting straight. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11001.560000000001s)]
*  But if you do this with an exercise, there's two exercises. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11003.880000000001s)]
*  I feel it. I feel it. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11006.68s)]
*  I feel like I'm sitting straight. [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11008.04s)]
*  There's two exercises. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11010.04s)]
*  I feel it. I feel like a workout of these muscles. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11011.2s)]
*  That's right. I'm feeling these muscles in a different way [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11014.84s)]
*  than I feel doing anything else. [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11017.04s)]
*  You know, you want to freak out even more. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11019.24s)]
*  I want you to just lean over a little bit. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11021.28s)]
*  Lean on your legs. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11023.4s)]
*  Just completely relax. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11027.72s)]
*  Oh, you can do this, actually. Here. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11029.28s)]
*  So yeah, just lean. [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11030.48s)]
*  Yeah, but lean over. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11032.24s)]
*  And now put it in your mouth. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11033.76s)]
*  And then when you want to inhale, focus on your back muscle, [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11034.84s)]
*  the lower part of your back muscle to expand. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11037.92s)]
*  Do that. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11039.88s)]
*  Because we have really muscles 360 degrees circumferential. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11042.72s)]
*  Those muscles I never worked out. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11047.4s)]
*  Once I start adding this exercise to it, my stamina got insane. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11049.16s)]
*  You go also. I feel the muscles on my back. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11055.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I feel it. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11057.759999999998s)]
*  You don't want to do 30 repetitions like this [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11059.039999999999s)]
*  because tomorrow felt like you did a very hard back workout [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11061.039999999999s)]
*  that you're going to walk around. [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11064.039999999999s)]
*  Listen, boss, I'm going to use this every day. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11065.08s)]
*  I'm going to check in with you in a month. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11067.359999999999s)]
*  I'm going to use this. I will 100% do this. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11069.28s)]
*  Because you are the guy who actually does it. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11071.24s)]
*  Like, OK, one thing that I want to say for the people, right? [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11073.720000000001s)]
*  If you use it for endurance and you do it before endurance workout, [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11076.880000000001s)]
*  think about this. You're tiring your breathing muscles. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11080.08s)]
*  I got an idea. How about I do that in the cold plunge? [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11082.960000000001s)]
*  I'm going to kill two birds with one stone. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11086.76s)]
*  Jesse, that's what I always do, too. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11088.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11089.800000000001s)]
*  So I'll change my cold plunge from three minutes to four minutes. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11091.0s)]
*  And I'll just do that the entire time I'm in the cold plunge. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11093.960000000001s)]
*  All right. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11096.24s)]
*  Because that tightens you up. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11096.84s)]
*  That tightens up your... [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11098.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're going to... [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11099.439999999999s)]
*  You watch what's going to happen. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11100.759999999998s)]
*  I'm excited. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11102.56s)]
*  Dude, it will change you. I'll guarantee you. [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11104.56s)]
*  But I just want to know for the people, [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11106.8s)]
*  if you buy for endurance and you do it before endurance, [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11108.08s)]
*  it will backfire. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11110.439999999999s)]
*  It's like you have to move, but you do a biceps workout. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11111.599999999999s)]
*  It's not really going to help you. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11114.88s)]
*  You know, so... You got to build up. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11116.359999999999s)]
*  You got to build up. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11117.64s)]
*  So in the beginning, what I say to these people, do it in the evening [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11118.24s)]
*  so your breathing muscles can rest during the night. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11121.56s)]
*  And then the next day you go... [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11124.119999999999s)]
*  But the difference you're going to notice, you watch. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11125.92s)]
*  I don't have to say anything. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11128.56s)]
*  We have the highest ratings on Amazon. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11129.759999999998s)]
*  I mean, we beat every other product out there. [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11131.679999999998s)]
*  I'm 100% going to do this and I'm 100% going to check in with you. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11133.32s)]
*  I'm going to let you know. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11136.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, perfect. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11136.96s)]
*  I'm excited. [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11137.64s)]
*  Me too. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11138.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11139.0s)]
*  Yeah, no thank you. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11139.48s)]
*  Boss, this is a good fucking time. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11140.439999999999s)]
*  Tell people how they can get that. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11142.039999999999s)]
*  O2Trader.com. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11143.759999999998s)]
*  It's on Amazon. It's everywhere. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11145.0s)]
*  Read the reviews, guys. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11146.439999999999s)]
*  Amazon are reviews that you cannot mess around. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11147.4s)]
*  If you're the number one choice... [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11150.16s)]
*  I feel it right there, just doing that. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11151.24s)]
*  Immediately. I feel it. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11152.72s)]
*  And I felt it in my back too when you made me lean forward. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11154.0s)]
*  I really do feel it. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11156.16s)]
*  And plus it will align your spine. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11157.24s)]
*  You know, diaphragmatic breathing is good for... [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11159.4s)]
*  I have a singing school from Australia that's buying it. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11161.119999999999s)]
*  You know, because projecting and acting, it's all breathing. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11163.759999999998s)]
*  All diaphragm. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11168.359999999999s)]
*  You watch. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11169.88s)]
*  And by the way, don't believe products that say that they... [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11170.8s)]
*  We can give you bigger lungs. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11173.48s)]
*  This is another last thing I want to say. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11175.0s)]
*  If you have an athletic workout, stretch your freaking chest muscles. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11176.759999999998s)]
*  This is important. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11181.8s)]
*  You lose, from the age of 28, you lose about 30 milliliters a year, [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11182.800000000001s)]
*  which means 300 milliliters in 10 years. [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11186.64s)]
*  I'm 58. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11189.28s)]
*  That means if I would never do any chest stretches, [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11190.12s)]
*  I would have lost almost a liter from the only six liters I have. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11194.32s)]
*  Women have four liters. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11198.08s)]
*  Men have six liters. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11199.36s)]
*  One and a half gallon, one gallon. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11200.76s)]
*  See? Talk about an advantage with the transition. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11202.6s)]
*  Never mind. [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11204.72s)]
*  But they just have 30% bigger lungs. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11205.6s)]
*  Whatever. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11208.56s)]
*  You know? But just make sure that you know that. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11209.4s)]
*  If you want to do stamina, just do it after the stamina. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11211.960000000001s)]
*  It goes out of us. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11215.2s)]
*  Brother, I'll check in with you. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11216.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11217.76s)]
*  Boss, boss. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11218.72s)]
*  Boss Root, you're the fucking man. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11219.6s)]
*  Always appreciate you. Welcome to Texas. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11221.12s)]
*  Yes, I'm here. [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11223.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11224.88s)]
*  All right. Thank you. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11225.36s)]
*  Bye, everybody. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_775vpoyMZs&t=11226.08s)]
